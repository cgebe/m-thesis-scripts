Statement by the President
You all deserved your holiday.
You all look well-rested and I hope that you are now looking forward very much to getting back to our work on European matters.
I am afraid that I have to start with some sad news.
Since we last met here, we have learned with deep sadness of the deaths of two great Europeans, Gaston Thorn and Raymond Barre, both eminent men who dedicated themselves to the service of their countries as outstanding Prime Ministers and Members of the European Commission.
Gaston Thorn was a Member of the European Parliament for ten years, from 1959 to 1969.
From 1969 to 1974, he was Luxembourg's Minister for Foreign Affairs and then became that country's Prime Minister in 1974, holding office until 1979.
He served as President of the European Commission from 1981 until 1985.
Under his guidance, the European Community negotiated the terms for the accession of Spain and Portugal, initiated the common fisheries policy and reached a solution to the contentious issues surrounding the Community's budgetary resources and its future financing.
Raymond Barre was the Vice-President of the European Commission from 1967 to 1973 and Prime Minister of France from 1976 to 1981.
As Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, he presented the initial proposals for the creation of a European economic and monetary union within the framework of the Barre Plan in 1969 and 1970.
Both men worked tirelessly on European integration until the end of their lives, making extremely important and practical contributions in support of this process under what, at that time, were often very difficult conditions.
Last weekend, Altiero Spinelli would have celebrated his 100th birthday.
As one of the architects of the present European institutions, Altiero Spinelli was a Member of this Parliament for ten years.
I had the great honour of working with him for seven of those ten years until his death in 1986.
During his ten years as a Member of the European Parliament, and especially as the Chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, he played a key role in pushing forward an ambitious agenda for institutional reform.
His draft Treaty establishing the European Union, which the European Parliament adopted by a substantial majority in 1984, created the basis for many of the important changes introduced by subsequent Treaty reforms, including a substantial expansion of the European Parliament's legislative powers.
During the summer recess, we witnessed a whole series of natural disasters: from the dramatic floods in the United Kingdom to the heat wave in the eastern Mediterranean and the recent tragic fires in Greece.
These events have inflicted great suffering on many people in Europe.
In Greece, more than 60 people died as a result of the major fires.
It is entirely appropriate that this tragedy should be the first important item on our agenda this afternoon, and I am sure that I speak for everyone in this House in expressing our most heartfelt condolences to the victims of these and other tragic events.
Our sympathy also goes out to the relatives of the more than 500 people who died in the earthquake in Peru on 15 August and to the thousands who, since we last met, have lost their lives in the senseless violence in Iraq.
The plight of the countless refugees still dying as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean and the Atlantic by boat in order to reach the European Union also causes us sorrow and concern.
It remains incumbent on all of us to find solutions to bring these tragedies to an end.
I would ask you to rise for a minute's silence in remembrance of the dead.

Protection of soil - Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the protection of soil and amending Directive 2004/35/EC - C6-0307/2006 -, and
the report by Vittorio Prodi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection.
(DE) Madam President, I would not have asked for the floor again had not the Commissioner tried to play the victim in his closing remarks.
Commissioner, you must come to terms with the fact that you are in a European forum in which you have a specific obligation to be very careful about what you say, and what you said in the Il Messaggero interview was factually incorrect.
No authority in Europe has the right to go into some camp, ask a person 'How do you make your living?' and deport the person if they cannot answer immediately.
That is completely and utterly wrong, but that is what you said in the interview with Il Messaggero, so do not get into a huff when it is pointed out to you.
In any case the debate is closed.
I am sorry, but it is not possible.
I thought that you wanted to put an item on the agenda.
The debate is closed.
Let us proceed. ...
I am opposed to this intervention.
We cannot go any further with this, I thought that Mr Schulz wanted to add an item to the agenda.
Madam President, let me start by thanking the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the other committees, for their contribution during first reading.
The Commission's proposal for a thematic strategy for soil protection arises from work begun in 1998 on the initiative of the German Ministry of the Environment.
As a result of lengthy consultations with interested parties and the Member States, soil was recognised as a valuable natural resource and its degradation in Europe is becoming problematic.
The Commission has subsequently collaborated with the parties involved, above all with Parliament and the Council, so that soil protection issues can be better understood and a consensus can be reached in this area.
Τhe Parliament resolution on the 2002 Communication on soil protection made important recommendations to the Commission about the direction it must take to ensure proper soil protection in Europe.
With the conclusions approved in Majorca in 2002, the European Council asked the Commission to propose a comprehensive, far-reaching strategy on soil protection embracing general principles, appropriate quantitative and qualitative targets, and schedules for gauging and evaluating the planned measures.
Let me turn to some more specific issues.
I find it very satisfying that soil degradation is recognised as a grave problem that must be overcome.
In view of the present Parliament's keen interest in desertification, for example, it is important that here in Europe we should openly declare our commitment to dealing with the causes of this problem, both in Europe and around the world.
Climate change and certain unsuitable soil management practices are putting our soil at risk.
Determining the extent of degradation and then developing methods to ensure that soil is used sustainably represents a direct application of the knowledge-based approach that Parliament rightly values.
Thus efforts will be guaranteed to be more focused and resources will be used more effectively to serve our purposes.
Businesses are entitled to expect consistent application of Community legislation by Member States.
In the environmental impact analysis prepared by the Commission, it is estimated that there are about 3.5 million sites in the EU likely to have become contaminated.
A proportion of these, perhaps 15%, have definitely been contaminated.
It is therefore vital that businesses should be confident that similar procedures will be adopted for the designation of contaminated sites, thus allowing for planned investments.
We must also bear in mind that there is a direct relationship between climate change and soil.
For example, according to a recent research article published in the authoritative international scientific journal Nature, over the past 25 years in the United Kingdom alone, the soil has been releasing 13 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year - as much as would be given off by an additional 5 million cars each year.
It is also worth noting that the soil's ability to absorb carbon and convert it into useful humus has not yet been fully exploited.
In the light of this, allow me to summarise the basic aims of the measures proposed by the Commission:
Firstly, a highly flexible, but consistent and comprehensive European soil policy must be developed.
With the creation of a framework for sustainable soil use, and with the adoption of measures at source, this policy will prevent further degradation of the soil, whose vitally important social, environmental and economic functions will be preserved.
Secondly, the necessary information on the condition of soil in Europe must be gathered so that we can make knowledge-based policy decisions and focus our efforts where the most serious degradation has been noted.
Thirdly, degraded soils should where possible be restored on the basis of an analysis of soil condition, to be carried out by the Member States.
The aim of the restoration should be to achieve soil quality consistent at least with the current and intended use of the land.
Fourthly, minimum common rules should be adopted for the EU as a whole to ensure a consistent approach among the Member States on matters of soil protection.
These common rules will help establish transparency and avoid distortion of the internal market.
The aim of the strategy and the directive is to launch a long-term policy on soil protection in Europe, so that in a few years, time all the Member States will have made considerable progress in this area.
I should like to draw your attention to certain key aspects of the framework directive on soil protection:
Firstly, the document produced after the codecision process has to be unambiguous and provide legal clarity for the interested parties affected by this legislative process.
We must avoid introducing amendments with legal loopholes, unnecessarily restricting the scope of the directive.
Secondly, the proposal already contains a high degree of subsidiarity and flexibility.
I understand that certain amendments are being proposed to increase still further the degree of subsidiarity.
However, you must be sure that these amendments will not create difficulties in the application of the directive by all Member States.
This applies especially to the amendments concerning programmes of measures in the priority areas specified in the directive.
Thirdly, in order to achieve a high degree of environmental protection, we must agree on a consistent approach to be followed by all Member States for the identification of contaminated soils.
The proposed deletion of Annex II would prevent us from achieving our aim.
To conclude, let me state that from now on the Commission will follow developments during the discussion of its proposal in the Council and in the European Parliament.
It will then define its position accordingly.
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, before discussing the proposal that is going to be voted on this morning, I would like to thank the rapporteurs from all the political groups, and I would especially like to thank Mrs Sornosa, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and our friend Mr Prodi, who have really worked side by side and have enriched the directive, as have the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and many other Members.
The document that is going to be voted on tomorrow has several amendments, which were the result of an agreement, and it has therefore been enriched by contributions from other political parties.
It is a document that is largely based on a consensus, which is unexpected in an environmental policy that it could be said is going to generate a new European policy and is opening up a new path.
This document is extremely innovative, as it is responding to a new way of tackling directives.
We were facing the problem that, out of 27 countries, only nine had soil protection legislation, and this is an issue that we are going to have to tackle again in the future.
Europe has developed asymmetrically, and there are currently many countries that are at doctorate level in terms of soil policy while others are only doing their A-levels.
How can we arrive at a policy of consensus, a common policy, when there are such huge differences?
This is the challenge with which we were faced.
What was the solution?
We went to the Treaty and saw that when defining directives, Article 249 states that directives are common objectives, but that the implementation and application of them can be left up to the Member States, and this is what was done.
Articles 1 and 2 have been strengthened right up to Article 6 in order to make the common objectives clear.
In other words, we have set out the goal.
We know the goal that we need to get to, and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals, but not all countries can move at the same pace.
Those who have not yet begun to advance cannot be asked to do the same as the rest.
We therefore ask for implementation to be left in the hands of the Member States, with maximum respect for subsidiarity, thus eliminating the fear in some countries that have already made progress that their official arrangements will be repeated.
There is no need for those countries that have clear soil protection to do it all over again.
This policy of flexibility also applies to recognising that, given the climate and conditions in each country, each one needs to be allowed to come to an agreement with its citizens in order to implement these policies.
Therefore, for example, in Article 8 we guarantee that farmers can make an agreement with their Member States on soil conservation, and those that have already done so will not have to repeat the legislation.
This means that at the same time we need to ensure that there is a clear policy on contaminated soil and, in this respect, the health of citizens comes before everything else, along with the objectives of protecting health and being transparent in providing information to citizens; this is clear.
Why do I think it is important for there to be a directive, in the face of the critics that do not want one?
It is important, ladies and gentlemen, because we have to build Europe based on our strengths, so we need to follow those countries that have done things well.
On the other hand, if we do not legislate we will enter into uncertainty and insecurity, and insecurity and uncertainty undermine the market and health.
Let us build Europe around its strengths, not its weaknesses.
This is the path that we have to take.
Moreover, subsidiarity is being guaranteed, and it is being stated that there does not need to be duplication of official arrangements or of legislation.
Member States are being given responsibility for carrying it out, and freedom means responsibility.
In a Europe of 27 members, we need to learn that environmental policy cannot be made by implementing it through the judicial system.
We cannot solely rely on prosecutors and the Court of Justice to apply it.
We need to rely on a common policy, and on faith in the credibility and capacity of the Member States to get going and carry out the best policies.
This is why we have largely looked to good practice.
Something else that is innovative about this directive is that, for the first time, it tackles climate change in relation to soil, dealing with adequate treatment of soil for floods, and for combating desertification and erosion.
There is another thing that we need to take into account: Europe and its countryside are the result of the work of man; they have been produced by farmers as the gardeners of the countryside.
We must take into account that the Europe of the future must be built by its citizens, and therefore, I repeat, we must set common objectives, but help them to take the path that will also ensure health and a commitment to transparency.
Thank you very much, and thank you once again to the political parties.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you and extend my thanks again to the rapporteur Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines.
It was a task that we worked on together and I hope that this has helped to improve the text.
The directive under discussion today is aimed at protecting European soil from phenomena such as desertification, erosion and salinisation, increasingly linked with climate change and specific soil pollution.
Paradoxically, despite the numerous regulations on the use and release into the environment of pollutants, there was no directive that made provision for any obligation to identify and certify soil that had been seriously polluted before improving it.
However, this seems to bother some people in Parliament and elsewhere, who are critical of what they call an attack on subsidiarity and the suffocating presence of the European institutions, which are using measures such as the Soil Framework Directive to harass groups of farmers or businesses, with unfair laws, unjust provisions and new administrative and/or financial burdens.
What are we talking about?
We are talking about the same directive that gives the Member States a period of some 25 years just to identify all areas in the national territory that might be considered seriously polluted, and thus compromised for various uses, both public and private, and all areas at serious risk in fact of desertification, erosion, salinisation and loss of compaction.
We are talking about guidelines for organising a systematic improvement scheme, where necessary, in the collective interest.
We are talking about the protection of human health alongside the protection of the environment.
We are talking about a framework directive that not only respects the autonomy of the Member States, but contains no onerous provisions.
I ask you then why this aversion on the part of certain Member States and Parliament - the usual suspects - to accepting a list of activities and sites that must undergo comprehensive investigation by the national authorities?
What do they have to hide?
Why so much aversion, when their representatives on the Council have already accepted the binding nature of the investigation into all sites proposed by the Commission in Annex II, and the principle of transparency which must prevail in soil-related transactions?
In addition, there is added value in a Europe-wide approach towards soil monitoring, which will improve the ability of the Member States to learn about their soil.
In any case reports to the Commission will be practically automatic, since they will be based on satellite surveys.
It is not common knowledge perhaps that a project of this type has already been carried out by the Commission, resulting in the Soil Atlas of Europe, which is a good example of what can be achieved if we work together.
However, there is another argument for a Community-based approach towards soil protection, which is climate change, a challenge facing all of Europe.
This challenge will consist of extreme climatic events: more rainfall, longer droughts, less snowfall and an increase in sea levels.
This means that we have a duty to manage the soil, precisely to combat these challenges, to increase water retention times across the entire territory to prevent flooding and encourage groundwater absorption, particularly along the coasts, and prevent saltwater infiltration, most likely due to rising sea levels.
Forestry management to control the risk of forest fires, since increased droughts will mean a greater risk of desertification in case of fire.
Incidentally, this type of land management will encourage the use of renewable energy such as hydro-energy and biomass.
Finally, we should not forget the part the soil plays in balancing greenhouse gases.
During the vote on Wednesday, I would ask you to consider that what we need more than anything is a strategy and a directive that can guarantee future generations the use and enjoyment of the soil that we now have in our safekeeping, bearing in mind that each Member State faces the same threats and the same environmental risks.
The soil is a resource, a resource that is scarce in Europe, and we must maximise its availability.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President, and thank you also to Commissioner Dimas for his decisive support for this directive.
We would like to welcome the Commission's proposal, as of course it aims to protect the soil and preserve its capacity to continue to carry out its environmental, economic, social and cultural functions, all of which are of course essential to human activity.
Moreover, as the Commissioner rightly said, it proposes flexible rules, which are ambitious in their objectives and not excessively prescriptive in their content.
Within a common framework, a minimum common denominator, the Member States are going to define their own level of intervention, enabling more efficient use of administrative capacity at national level.
Despite the exaggerated resistance to this directive from some sectors, it is evident that soil is a vital resource that is essentially non-renewable, which is suffering under growing environmental pressure for which human activity has significant responsibility.
According to the reports that have been discussed here, it has been calculated that the cost of soil degradation is approximately EUR 40 000 million per year, a cost that is borne by society in the form of damage to infrastructure, increases in the cost of healthcare and many other factors.
This directive is of course based on the precautionary and preventive action principles, and on the principle that environmental damage must be rectified at its origin and that the polluter pays.
This legislation will mitigate the cross-border effects of soil degradation, which do also exist, and it will help to ensure equal conditions in the internal market.
I would like to highlight this aspect, because the different obligations that economic operators may impose, in line with different national soil protection legislation, could distort competition.
To conclude, the soil protection directive is a step forward that will enable competition with greater transparency and will protect areas of common interest such as water, food safety and human health.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Madam President, I would really much prefer that this directive was not coming before us.
I would be supporting a rejection of it - not because I do not want to see soil protected, because it is in all our interests that it should be.
But is the directive the right way forward?
Commissioner Dimas, you said yourself that, at the moment, only nine Member States have legislation in place to protect soil.
I would suggest that it is up to the other 18 Member States to put legislation in place to protect the soil and we should not necessarily bring forward another directive.
We already have a Groundwater Directive and a Nitrates Directive.
As far as agriculture is concerned, we have got a lot of cross compliance legislation that deals with the soil and soil compaction.
I know the rapporteur is doing her very best to bring agriculture out of the proposal but I rather fear that what we will see is yet more bureaucracy and yet more difficulties for farmers.
The Commissioner also stated that there are 300 types of soil throughout the European Union.
It is very difficult to have one general directive to cover all these positions.
You only have to consider agriculture in a year like this, where in some Member States there have been droughts and others have had very wet weather, very heavy rainfall.
If you dig potatoes in many of the northern Member States this year, where there has been lots of rain, then of course you will cause compaction.
It is necessary to do that in order to get the crop.
That can be rectified the following year by subsoiling and repairing the damage to the soil.
We need flexibility in all this.
I really do think that the idea of having yet another directive in order to put more regulation upon our farmers and upon our industry is the wrong way to go.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Soil Protection Directive and the Soil Framework Directive, together with the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, rank among the key topics in this part-session, as of course they have done in recent weeks and months in the committees.
Normally a strategy - in this case about soil - is dealt with before the relevant directive, for good reason.
The advantage of proceeding in stages is usually that interests are discussed openly early on, so that the newly gained points of view can be taken into account as the directive is formulated.
With regard to the strong criticism that has been directed at the Commission proposal on the Soil Protection Directive, prior discussion about the topic would undoubtedly have been helpful, including to calm tempers all round.
In contrast to the normal nature of a framework directive, the Commission proposal - and I share this opinion - includes very rigid, detailed regulations, and commits the Member States to numerous examinations and reports that would result in a considerable administrative load.
This is unacceptable.
The new Member States already have national soil protection legislation that functions well.
For them, the Commission proposal would in some cases require their systems to be completely restructured: a high level of regulatory duplication and additional bureaucratic burden.
Therefore, numerous Member States are sceptical about this Directive, as has already been stated.
Nevertheless, in the last few months I have been heavily involved in transforming the Commission proposal, rewriting it.
Essentially, it was a matter of allowing the Member States more scope within which to operate, while still pursuing the goal of curbing the growing deterioration of the soil at European level.
I hope that, in the end, together with our friend Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, we arrived at a sensible result, including with regard to the significance of the overall topic of soil protection, a result that can be a model worldwide as well as in Europe.
May I therefore express my warm thanks to the rapporteur once again for offering a solution that enabled a compromise to be found.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in European legislation important natural resources (water, air, species, the habitats of flora and fauna) have specific Community legislation, while soil as a resource does not have any.
It is time to resolve this imbalance, and I therefore thank the Commission for its proposal, and also thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, for the work that she has done.
As many of us have said, soil is a non-renewable and therefore limited natural resource that carries out many important ecological and economic functions, and it is the basis of almost all human activities.
There is no doubt that the involvement of the European institutional legislative system in this area will provide an impetus for the improvement of legislation that is being put in place in many countries, by giving it a coherent framework that is supported by European regulation, and possibly European resources.
With regard to the immovable nature of soil, which appears to be cited as proof by some in order to justify their preferences for national or subsidiary treatment rather than a European policy, the European Commission's communication gives a sufficient argument as to why there needs to be a strategy at European level, and some colleagues, such as Mr Calabuig Rull, have mentioned this.
There are some Member States that are not very eager for the standardisation of soil protection at European level, and we therefore think that both the strategy and the directive are being given the right focus in terms of being a flexible legal instrument that is ambitious and not excessively prescriptive.
This means that each Member State can adapt it to its needs and to its social and economic situation, as a framework has been set out and long-term goals have been set.
In short, I think that the methodology of the proposal for a directive, based on prevention, raising awareness among citizens, providing information, identifying priority areas of degradation and making inventories of contaminated soil along with programmes of national measures and rehabilitation strategies is a coherent, efficient and flexible approach to dealing with the problem of soil degradation in Europe, while respecting the diversity of national situations and options.
I therefore ask this House, first of all, for a resounding 'no' to the outright rejection that this proposal has received in some sectors, and to support the compromise amendments, which we arrived at following lengthy negotiations.
Perhaps this is not the directive that everyone would like, but precisely because we are all in some way against this directive, it may be able to serve us for the future.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, I too should like to convey my very sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, who has expended a great deal of energy in the last few months acting as a broker between proponents and opponents of a directive and who, in the end, managed to prepare the basis of a workable compromise.
Nevertheless, I am, as I always have been, of the same opinion as the Members of this House who want to reject the Commission proposal.
Let there be no mistake: our soils are the basis of our existence.
Without healthy soil there is no agriculture, no natural cycle of nutrients and, in the long term, no life.
We are responsible for protecting our soils from harmful effects where possible, and keeping them in good condition.
However, this Directive is not the right way to achieve this.
I do not believe that the question here is whether we wish to protect our soils better or not; instead, at the European level the question as I see it is: is this within our jurisdiction or not?
I believe that it is not.
Obviously, many Member States have developed their own functioning soil protection legislation, with more concern for and better solutions to local problems than would be possible with centralised regulation from Brussels.
Therefore I would ask the House to support the amendments that retain operational scope for the Member States.
Apart from that, we are about to create vast amounts of new bureaucracy and expense for administrative bodies and businesses.
There are amendments that would use the mere establishment of an industrial business as a reason to require detailed examinations and reports.
Let me quickly give you just one example, that of the building of industrial gas plants.
These separate normal air, which is a mixture of gases, into its components -which does not harm the soil at all.
We should not be worrying about things like that, but only about things where there is justified concern that they may contaminate the soil.
I believe that it is high time we refrained from the preparation and publishing of soil status reports.
That is an encroachment on freedom of contract.
The sale of land is covered by civil law, with good reason, and it should stay this way.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, in the end, we shall achieve a Directive that really does guarantee protection of the soil and does not primarily increase administrative load.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a saying that is well known in many countries: 'better late than never'.
We are coming late to soil protection, after many decades of devastation, as is most evident in industrial regions, but it is good that we have come to realise that the soil feeds us and we must not destroy it.
We must not treat it like a commercial item and operate a policy under which the biggest business is the purchase of agricultural land and its alienation from agricultural production for other purposes.
This policy is already coming home to roost.
It is good that we can finally see this and begin to protect the soil, our provider.
May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture.
Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert.
On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I support the reports by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Prodi.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we stand for a definite 'yes' to EU-wide soil protection.
We have heard that soil is our most important non-renewable resource.
Soil deterioration costs the EU more than EUR 38 billion every year.
In Germany, only 2% of the soil is still in its natural condition.
Twelve per cent of soils in the EU are affected by erosion.
Soil deterioration does not respect national borders.
Thus we are in the process of pulling the rug out from under our own feet by the way we are currently using our soils.
The EU proposal was good; it went in the right direction, and we should have liked to improve it.
I know that the rapporteur fought for it, but unfortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety watered down and further spoiled a great many points of the proposal under pressure from the conservatives and the agricultural lobby.
I cannot understand why we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed to maintain secrecy about soil containing inherited contamination.
I hope we shall still be able to correct this tomorrow.
It runs counter to transparency and also to the Aarhus Convention.
We also know that climate change and good-quality soil go hand in hand, that soil is an important carbon dioxide pool and is continually losing this ability to bind CO2.
Because of the watering down that has happened in the Committee on the Environment, I fear that an ambitious Soil Protection Directive is, unfortunately, impossible.
However, we need effective soil protection with a shared timeframe and common criteria.
In short, we need effective, specific goals to put a stop to the deterioration of soils in the European Union.
We must not give up on creating something that is legally binding because of this so-called compromise.
Only legally binding measures will enable us to set an ambitious soil strategy in motion.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important and positive directive.
I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Dimas, who handled this.
I say so myself, as a member of a group that often criticises directives and the Commission: this is not the case here.
This directive will be a huge step forward for Europe, both from the point of view of the quality of its policies and its effectiveness.
With the completion of the framework directives on the natural elements, the soil will be considered as a key part of the biosphere, a fundamental element of the environmental and climatic balance and not just a platform on which to build.
The soil is living, it absorbs CO2, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted.
Europe understands this.
We had a long and difficult discussion in the Committee, and I would like to thank Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines for being so passionate about the subject.
However, there is the risk that Parliament will interfere with the Commission's text.
I never like to see this happen, I always prefer it when Parliament is more advanced than the Commission.
Someone has even recommended that the directive should be rejected, but this would be a serious mistake.
Europe must look to the future.
The soil beneath us is soil that we all share, it is part of our planet.
It is the only soil we have and we must look after it.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I can see some of the logic in EU-level legislation regulating water and air quality.
We share these in the EU and, indeed, globally.
However, I find the logic fails with the protection of soils.
Soils are much less mobile and, other than the setting of reasonable standards of protection, should be the competence of Member States and, within them, the local authorities.
Before the EU takes too much control of soils maybe we need to do a bit of soul-searching.
In Ireland, some of the problematic policies in terms of soil degradation have come top-down from Europe.
For example, the EU sugar reform removed beet from the wheat rotation.
The insertion of beet conditioned the soil and made it more suitable for cereals.
Also, the EU forest grants over the years have resulted in unsuitable spruce plantations that, in growth, have made the soil more acidic and, in harvesting, have in some cases compacted the soil, rendering it infertile, whilst in others have loosened it from the hills, from which it has been washed into rivers and lakes.
Soil varies enormously but it should be living and renewing.
The EU should ban soil destruction but leave its care and management to the people who understand its composition in each area.
(SK) Before looking at the actual wording of the proposed framework directive on soil protection, we should consider whether EU legislation in this area is actually needed.
The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken into consideration. It clearly rejected the need for soil protection legislation in the EU on the basis that soil does not have any cross-border implications and is therefore a regional issue.
Despite the fact that other committees, in their respective opinions, were essentially in favour of EU legislation in this matter, certain factions are somewhat hesitant.
For example, the amendment to Article 5 in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly indicates that the degradation of the soil has local or regional causes and effects and it is therefore essential to adopt national as opposed to European measures.
This appears to be in conflict with the remainder of the text, which is clearly in favour of the framework directive.
Similar wording can be found in the amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to Article 2.
On the other hand, it is important to recognise that the degradation of soil, as a non-renewable resource, has significant consequences on other aspects, for which legislation already exists, such as water quality, food safety, climate change, etc.
Even if both sides were partly right with regards to the need for a framework directive, I believe that the decision to adopt or reject the European framework will be a political one.
I would like to comment on the change in the character of the report from negative to positive.
One example is the replacement of the term 'risk area' with 'priority area'.
I believe that for areas where soil degradation needs to be stopped urgently we must use urgent terminology; soil at risk must be indicated with a negative term to underscore the seriousness of the situation.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work on the proposal in question.
Unfortunately, however, I must endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which calls on the committee responsible to propose rejection of the Commission proposal.
The reasons cited by the committee are valid and remain so in spite of the substantial changes made to the proposal in the last few months.
Soil really does not have any cross-border implications and should therefore remain a competence of the Member States.
Therefore, despite the positive changes, this proposal continues to represent a breach of the principle of subsidiarity. As far as proportionality is concerned, adopting such legislation could be seen as a waste of resources.
Moreover, it is important to remember that within the EU there are many different soil types, which are used in a variety of ways.
It is true that the Directive in question has become what could be described as a flexible framework directive.
In addition, as a result of our new philosophy, the Directive is binding as far as the results are concerned, but leaves the decision on the form and method up to the Member States. It is very positive that the existing Member State legislation covering these objectives does not need to be revised.
As such, we are genuinely moving towards the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
A positive side effect of this legislation would be the pressure that would be brought to bear on Member States with inadequate soil protection legislation at present, but I am not sure if this is the best way to put pressure on them.
After having weighed up all the pros and cons, I believe that it is not necessary to adopt the proposed directive.
The Member States can protect their soil on their own.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate the words of the French philosopher who said that if a law is not essential it must not be written.
(DE) Madam President, I am another representative who believes that soil protection is very definitely a task for the European Union, and that the European Parliament should therefore adopt this Framework Directive.
Nor, to be honest, do I understand the comments that have been made about how the different soil types in our Member States have not been taken into account.
I am going to read this Directive through again and try to see what the other Members are referring to, for I did not notice these inflexible measures and proposals.
I should also like to mention the role of agriculture, for, in my view, the compromise amendment by the various parties is very important.
It requires the Member States, when using soil for agricultural purposes, to encourage crops and afforestation methods that could have a beneficial effect on soil organic matter and soil fertility and thus prevent landslides and desertification.
Likewise, agricultural methods that prevent the compaction and erosion of soils should also be supported.
We know that very often agriculture causes problems for soil quality, and I believe that this clarification is absolutely vital.
I do not believe that the 'support for agriculture, no matter what' formula is sufficient to protect soils at regional, national, or even European level.
- (PL) Madam President, a framework directive on soil protection will in my view be an instrument that promotes the production of foodstuffs and adequate supplies of clean water for subsequent generations of EU citizens.
The soil also performs many other important functions: it is a substrate for human activities, along with towns and infrastructure, and also for nature and valuable landscapes.
Protection of the soil is essential for the maintenance of our natural heritage and raw materials.
In view of this situation, a flexible framework directive recognising the principle of subsidiarity will be an instrument that encourages Member States to protect their soils.
A directive couched in such terms is binding for Member States in respect of the results that may be achieved in the area of soil protection, but leaves Member States the choice of the forms and methods used to achieve such protection.
The proposals contained in the directive whereby Member States are to draw up lists of contaminated areas, including on a regional scale, to be published and updated every five years, are worthy of note.
This is important information for the protection of the life and health of EU citizens.
(FR) Madam President, I would also first like to congratulate our rapporteurs and applaud the difficult job Mrs Gutiérrez has accomplished in producing a result to protect our soil.
Unlike other fellow Members, I believe a more restrictive legislative approach would have provided better protection.
I also think it is a pity that our fellow Members whose countries have stricter regulation than that proposed here are still trying to water down this report with amendments that I would urge you very strongly to reject tomorrow.
Our agricultural and industrial activities and transport plans have drastically affected the quality of our soil.
However, this same soil is the foundation of biodiversity and our food.
It filters and stores organic matter and minerals, and also helps us to access water.
It plays a prominent role in the fight against climate change.
Furthermore, faced with growing demand for food and energy production, it is essential that we safeguard and restore the quality of our soil and prevent desertification.
Without legislation at European level, we cannot hope for results.
(NL) Madam President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.
This debate is a further demonstration that the proposed soil policy is very controversial.
Now that there are two proposals - the strategy and the Directive - it seems as though a new branch of environmental policy is being introduced.
I say 'seems', as nothing could be further from the truth.
Sustainable management of soil use already comes to the fore in 33 European directives, such as the Water Framework Directive.
Why, then, are we presenting overlapping legislation, entailing yet more burdens, particularly for Member States that already have a well-functioning soil policy?
I shall be supporting Mr Prodi's Thematic Strategy.
In my opinion, Member States who have yet to develop a soil policy must do so on the basis of the strategy.
The framework directive, on the other hand, is disproportionate and also, in my view, contravenes the principle of subsidiarity.
Unlike air and water, soil does not have a cross-border dimension, and policy is often implemented on a regional or local scale.
This is also the reason that I - that is, Mr Blokland - have joined in signing the amendment rejecting the Commission proposal.
Madam President, we are familiar with the idea that a land grab is the unwarranted appropriation of property belonging to another.
It seems to me that this soil directive amounts to an unwarranted power grab by Brussels, and of course brings with it an inevitable layer of fresh bureaucracy.
Soil, as has been said in this debate, unlike air and water, does not flow from state to state.
It has no cross-border dimension.
Thus policy on soil is and should remain a Member State issue.
IPPC, cross-compliance obligations, the Landfill Directive and the Nitrates Directive all give us more than enough EU involvement.
Hence I have no apology for favouring total rejection of this power-hungry proposal.
But, if, true to form, the EU nonetheless decides to meddle in this national issue, then one initiative it could consider is to introduce a payment to farmers in return for providing carbon sequestration in soil management and farming practices.
(FR) Madam President, my first thought on this proposal for a directive was to reject the text.
I also think that a framework directive was perhaps not an appropriate solution.
Why have another text on the protection of soil when we already have a whole raft of regulations on soil, waste, pesticides and the protection of nature?
Within the framework of better lawmaking, I was thinking that we should not appear to be going through the European Commission mill again.
I was putting myself in the shoes particularly of the mayors of our municipalities, who would find themselves with another text to dissect.
However, the reality is this: human practices have not respected the soil.
We have worn out the soil with intensive production.
In addition to this there is climate change and desertification.
Our urban planning policies have mineralised the soil, degraded it, and our fellow citizens are now surprised when they experience catastrophic flooding because the soil no longer absorbs the rain.
Who has not seen the open wounds in the landscape caused by the quarries that supply us with such valuable materials?
Impoverished, dried out, degraded, polluted and bruised soil - that is what has become of this land, which previous generations spoke about with veneration because the land was everything to them: their work, their food, their life and, for many, their only property.
What was once our mother Earth we now regard with suspicion.
What will be the consequences of this degradation, this pollution, for our environment and health?
Mrs Gutiérrez has done a remarkable job in trying to find an acceptable approach, in trying to bring closer together those who did not want this directive and those who did.
She has listened to Parliament.
She has found balanced positions that respect the need for subsidiarity in the choice of methods, because there is enormous disparity between the Member States.
The final text has evolved a great deal.
It avoids increasing the burden of administrative costs by encouraging us to put right the mistakes of the past, our agricultural, industrial and urban practices that did not respect the soil.
This report, completely remodelled by Mrs Gutiérrez, is satisfactory.
There is such soil diversity in the European Union that the subsidiarity guarantee is essential, while ensuring the protection and sustainable use of the soil.
(HU) It is our fundamental goal to guarantee a healthy environment for our citizens, and there is stringent Union legislation for most elements of our environment.
Soil is the only element of the environment that we have not yet been able to regulate, so there is currently no Union instrument to halt the pollution of soil and the erosion of its quality, even though this causes many tens of millions of euros' worth of damage for all of us.
According to the current legislation, it is only compulsory to act against soil pollution when the pollution enters other elements of the environment: groundwater, fresh water, agricultural products, or when it is too late to act in practice.
I would welcome the adoption of this new Directive by the European Union, and I am pleased that a compromise package has been created that is even more acceptable from the perspective of environmental protection.
It is also important from a Hungarian perspective that, as many of us have proposed, the legislation should also deal with tackling soil acidification.
This is a serious threat to agricultural production, so it must be fought using Union instruments for this reason too.
Recognition of the polluted areas will encourage remediation, so we can prevent the pollution of water tables for drinking water, and naturally the cultivation of polluted plants.
Soil regulation is therefore in the interests of farmers.
I therefore hope that certain MEPs from the right, including, surprisingly, some Hungarian MEPs, will not succeed in their endeavour to prevent the creation of a Directive to protect the interests of Hungarian agriculture and the environment.
In the spirit of the Directive, the rehabilitation of the polluted or soil-degraded areas uncovered will be a task for the Union, for which resources will need to be found in future Community budgets.
Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps.
Firstly, soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably.
How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates?
It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia.
Now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers, many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection.
They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil, because it is their livelihood.
They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation.
The second large credibility gap is provided by the EU's short-sighted open border policy, which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country. This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available - some three million new homes by 2020, we are told.
Even the green belt is under threat.
Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I support the soil strategy elaborated in the Prodi report, but oppose the Directive on soil.
I do so quite clearly on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Therefore, I have tabled an amendment rejecting it, but also one opting for another instrument, namely open coordination.
The objectives can be achieved in full by this means.
After all, it is abundantly clear that this all centres on stimulation, knowledge sharing and monitoring.
Everything is possible, including financial support from the Union.
The risk of duplication remains: once again, priority areas are designated, and even the sea bed has been drawn back into the debate.
The citizens of my country, the Netherlands, do not understand the reason for unnecessary legislation from above, from European level.
As has been said, there are already more than 30 directives concerning soil quality, either directly or indirectly.
What is the point of central legislation when a decentralised approach is also possible?
Nevertheless, I do appreciate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines's attempts to steer the rules more in the direction of subsidiarity.
Finally, I have submitted many more proposals, with 40 signatures: amendments aiming to further increase the emphasis on quality and soil protection and to respond to new challenges such as climate change.
No legislation should be adopted at European level, however.
I appeal to my fellow Members to support my amendments in this regard.
(NL) Madam President, my thanks to Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, but I must say that, unfortunately, we do not agree with her.
There are a great many places in Europe with soil pollution or other soil problems such as erosion. These problems must be solved as quickly as possible.
I assume that everyone agrees with this.
The Commission is proposing to solve soil problems at European level - and, as far as I am concerned, there lies the problem.
After all, soil problems are often local, and only in specific cases do they have a real cross-border impact.
European cooperation is desirable in the case of soil problems with a cross-border impact, and in that instance solidarity and cooperation are important.
In the case of local and national soil problems, however, European policy is completely unnecessary.
Many Member States already have a good national policy for solving and preventing soil problems.
Their policy offers a level of protection that is at least as high as the one now on the table.
The Directive on soil should take these Member States into consideration - they should be exempt from European obligations - and therefore we plan to vote against this Directive.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez on having spent a great deal of time and energy compiling a draft text that has actually managed to come for plenary debate and voting despite the resistance that can be experienced in the Parliament.
Today, when the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change and civilisation mean an increasing burden on soil and thereby on the whole living world, this legislation is of particularly great importance.
For my part, the Directive is one of the most important statements on the importance of agricultural activity, and the undying merit of the people who work to maintain, protect and improve the soil.
Without them, we would not only be deprived of food, but the environment around us would also suffer serious damage.
Sustainable agriculture implemented with knowledge is one of the mainstays of environmental protection.
However, one of the most important conditions for this is information.
Information about the condition of the soil that is accessible to the public would be one of the fruits of the new legislation, which would finally protect people and farmers instead of polluters.
In my homeland of Hungary, the picture is typically two-fold: on the one hand, there is land of excellent quality and a high degree of legislative protection but, on the other hand, there is industrial pollution caused by forty years of Communism, and cleaning it up will take at least another forty years and EUR 4 billion.
Right now we are spending Union money on remedying this, but we would like to speed this process up in future, and this legislation would be a great help.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Soil Protection Directive we are completing a process in the theological sense too.
We have already regulated all the elements that created the world: air, water, fire - meaning energy - and their importance is thoroughly and appropriately protected by the Union, so now it is the turn of the fourth element, earth, thus completing the circle.
Thank you very much.
(NL) Mr President, Secretary, I should like to start by expressing my sincere congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, and by thanking her for her enormous efforts to strike a balance between supporters and opponents of this Directive, in what is after all a very difficult dossier.
Personally, I am firmly convinced that a European Directive on soil protection is necessary, for various reasons.
I hope that there is still a chance of my convincing Mrs McGuinness.
Some MEPs reject the framework directive because their country already has far-reaching legislation on soil.
My region - Flanders - has also been conducting a progressive soil policy for some years.
For example, a system of compulsory soil certificates in the case of property transfers - even now inconceivable in many Member States - has been in place for a long time.
I should like to turn the reasoning of these Members around.
This flexible Directive not only provides a framework for those Member States that do not yet have a soil policy but is also clearly capable of preventing the undermining of the competitive position of the countries and regions that are already making an effort.
For this reason, it is very important that all Member States take the measures presented in the report.
There is certainly a cross-border impact in a great many places: for example, erosion in Flanders could generate sludge in the Netherlands and vice versa.
The Directive also provides a coherent framework for existing legislation on soil protection.
I could give more reasons but, because of time constraints, I shall conclude by saying that the report under discussion today fills all the aforementioned needs much better than the original Commission proposal.
I myself have also tabled many amendments and am very pleased with the result.
The proposal provides the Member States with sufficient elbow room, creates no additional administrative burdens or duplication, and also explicitly recognises the role of regional authorities.
I therefore hope for strong support from my fellow Members in tomorrow's vote.
Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines.
I think she has done an absolutely fantastic job on a report which is not needed or wanted by most of us and, Commissioner Dimas, in my opinion brings this House and the Commission into total disrepute.
You are bringing out legislation which is totally and utterly unnecessary.
What you should be doing is enforcing the legislation that we have.
The Commission usually fails totally in enforcing legislation which is already there.
I can give you a number of cases, but I do not wish to do it just now.
If I were to look, for example, at your colleague, Mr Kyprianou: we have just had yet another outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom; we have got bluetongue; today it was announced that we have avian flu.
He promised to stop all this.
He was going to do everything to stop it.
I believed him.
I believe the Commission when it says something, and yet what happens is that it does not enforce the legislation that is in place to stop these sorts of things coming in.
I call on this House to totally reject this piece of legislation.
I think Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has done an absolutely fantastic job and I will support her totally if this House decides not to reject it, but I shall briefly mention something that Mrs Scheele and Mrs Corbey said on erosion.
I totally agree with them.
Erosion is a big problem, but not necessarily in the European Union.
It is a problem where we have deforestation, and that is something that we could do something about.
I thought Mr Allister's points were absolutely correct.
I think the Commission is failing us.
It fails to enforce regulations.
I will leave you with one last thought.
As a farmer, the soil is my life.
I will protect it to the very best of my ability.
Do not put more legislation in place.
Allow me to get on with protecting the soil, which provides the food, which provides the income for the people who live in the rural communities.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what the Commission states - that soil is the crucial basis for the long-term, sustainable production of food, feed and biomass - is true.
It is also true that we cannot be satisfied with the state of the soils in the European Union, but to draw from that the conclusion that we need a directive at European level is to head off in the wrong direction.
Why is that?
We are not taking account of the fact that there are already numerous regulations within the European Union that apply to soil and that we could use effectively.
Examples are the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Directive, and the rules on cross-compliance: with these, we can have a financial influence on the improvement of the situation in individual countries.
These are all existing measures, and if we add the Soil Protection Directive to them it will create regulatory duplication - parallel legislation - that really only creates more bureaucracy.
We say we want to reduce bureaucracy by 25% by 2010, but this will only achieve the very opposite!
It will achieve a 25% increase.
In the Treaty, we undertook to regulate locally the things that could best be regulated at that level, and that is what we must do, and we must accelerate this.
The claim that the deterioration of soil is causing climate change is, however, unacceptable.
Scientists are unanimous that this deterioration is a result of climate change, and not the reason for it.
The rapporteur has certainly put a lot of work into this, but when we see that rules that are implemented by other directives have priority, that is unacceptable: we do not have top-priority directives and then lower-priority directives.
If we really want to achieve something, let us stick to the method of open coordination, transferring expertise from country to country.
That is the right approach and it will surely bring a result.
This Directive, on the other hand, brings only bureaucracy and confusing legislation.
(DE) Mr President, where is the added value?
Where is the justification for European regulations on soil protection?
The Commission's arguments concerning cross-border effects are rather artificial - at least from the ecological point of view.
Nor can I accept the argument that the internal market is distorted by different national soil protection legislation.
If the Commission really meant that, it would not present us with a framework directive, which accords the Member States the greatest possible self-determination in the definition of goals for soil protection.
That would increase the differences in soil protection legislation more than it would even them out.
Does not this approach reveal that the Commission is unsure as to how it should proceed in terms of subsidiarity when it comes to legislation for soil in specific locations?
In such a case, where we all wish for better soil protection, but national legislation differs, should we not first use the instrument of open coordination?
I believe so.
The Framework Directive takes the second step before the first.
We are missing out on the opportunity for countries without legislation to learn from countries with excellent soil-protection practices.
We shall also experience bureaucracy, particularly in those countries that already have tough legislation.
Why should they have to examine their entire country and define risk areas, even though they already have exemplary legislation?
We do not need this bureaucracy, nor do we need the gilt-edged soil-protection system that Europe is now demanding from us.
In closing, a comment on the argument that Parliament itself asked for this Directive years ago.
Yes, that was the case five years and more ago.
However, in the meantime we have had experience of the Habitats Directive, the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control, the Water Framework Directive and many more.
As well, unlike the Commissioners, we are held accountable locally.
Therefore we do not hold fast to five-year and ten-year plans when businesses and local authorities on the ground are telling us that it is too much of a good thing.
I acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur to make the Directive less stringent, but bureaucracy is best avoided at source.
We still have the opportunity to do that by rejecting the Directive.
I hope that we give the Council a strong signal that it cannot expect its nations to accept this wave of bureaucracy.
in writing. - (DE) In the light of the recent agreement on the Reform Treaty, the European Parliament, and with it the whole EU, must support and strengthen this renewed confirmation of a spirit of closeness to citizens and of the protection of subsidiarity, starting with the current initiatives.
The present proposal on the Soil Protection Framework Directive does not do justice to this intention.
The bureaucracy required in connection with it bears no relation to the actual usefulness of the Directive, and there is no way it can be justified to the citizens of Europe.
Quite the contrary, it runs counter to the decision of the European Council to reduce bureaucracy at EU level by 25% by 2012.
Soil is first and foremost a local resource.
Effective soil protection must, therefore, be carried out at the most suitable levels - at the regional or local level.
Only at these levels can the very wide range of soil characteristics be dealt with comprehensively.
Despite the extensive improvements made by the rapporteur, I reject this proposal, because it infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
Some Member States already have extremely good regulations, which could even be weakened by this Directive.
If necessary, the open-coordination method could provide a solution.
- (PL) Soil degradation is a fact.
One factor causing of this state of affairs is ... the common agricultural policy.
Self-sufficiency in foodstuffs has been achieved at the cost of the intensification of agriculture and degradation of the soil.
An increase in economic efficiency leads to the elimination of small and medium-sized farmers, the vast majority of whom are more environmentally friendly than large profit-oriented agricultural businesses.
This is the final call to slow down the process of abandoning farming and return to a rational and balanced agricultural model that protects the soil.
The current distribution of agricultural subsidies is, however, in conflict with this model.
Subsidies are directed above all to agricultural concerns and large intensive farms - 1.39% of beneficiaries receive almost 30% of subsidies!
The CAP must be amended.
Its main aim should be the production of healthy foods, not increased competitiveness.
Good soil should be a key element in this new policy.
That is why I support all actions that serve to protect the soil and restore its fertility.
Let us not compete with products originating from monocultures and intensive livestock rearing.
Let us say NO to cheap meat crammed with hormones.
Let us not compete with fruit that has little nutritional value, with cheap, low-quality wine or with GM foods, whose consequences we still know little about.
The European agricultural model should genuinely make us stand out in the world and be an example to it.

The European Union and Humanitarian Aid (vote)
- Report: Thierry Cornillet
(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the discussion on the compromise version of this resolution, we had precisely 16 minutes to submit amendments and to review the results of our work.
I believe that this undermines the rights of every Member of this House and every political group in this House to be able freely to influence the texts of our resolutions, including by submitting amendments.
I would ask that this situation should not be allowed to reoccur in the future.
- Before the vote on amendment 1:
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we speak about frozen conflicts.
We mention two conflicts - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - but I would like, on behalf of my Group, to introduce after 'frozen conflict' the phrase 'such as Transnistria', so that Transnistria is also mentioned in Recital O.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Mr Swoboda has already informed you of our amendment, which was about Transnistria.

The European Interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation (vote)
- Joint motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote on the heading above paragraph 1:
on behalf of the ALDE group. - I would like to suggest changing the heading of the first part to read: 'External Lisbon dimension'.
That is to say, to change 'External policies' to 'External Lisbon dimension'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 5:
(DE) Mr President, due to the withdrawal of an oral amendment to paragraph 5, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to vote 'no', contrary to what is stated in its lists.
- Before the vote on paragraph 14:
(DE) Mr President, there are Members who have a problem with the central section, the part from 'points out that one' to 'domestic demand'.
In agreement with Mr Caspary from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I therefore suggest adding the words 'in some Member States' after 'European economy', and I hope that this will deal with the problems with the central section.
I believe this could also be of assistance to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 30:
(DE) Mr President, there is no objection to postponing the text, but I would still ask that we hold a vote on it.
If Parliament votes in favour of the text, the text belongs elsewhere, but it could be that it is not endorsed, which is why I am asking for a vote on the original text.
There has been no request for a split vote.
- After the final vote:
(SV) Mr President, Parliament has now voted in favour of updating and amending the Integrated Guidelines.
This concerns, for example, the social dimension.
So far the Commission has chosen not to pay attention to this.
I would like to hear Mr Špidla's comments on the decision which Parliament has now taken and whether he is going to push the issue of updated and amended Integrated Guidelines within the Commission.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) The decision taken by Parliament has a certain weight and the Commission must take it into account when preparing further documentation. Therefore, Parliament's vote naturally carries the appropriate weight and the issue of the Integrated Guidelines was fundamental in the debate we held with Parliament.
We interpret 'certain weight' to mean 'great weight' and recommend that the Commission adopt our assessment.

Tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to start by emphasising what my report, which is being debated today, is essentially about.
While the report is nominally about taxation, the real issue at stake here is the proper functioning of the internal market of the EU.
The global economy is developing in a way that puts an increasing amount of pressure on Europe to maintain its competitiveness, a fact that has been underlined and widely agreed upon in various instances, notably in the Lisbon Strategy and its revisions.
We must be proactive in rising to the challenge and I believe that a fully-functioning single market is the first priority in achieving this.
In addition to the freedom of movement of goods, people and services, this implies, crucially, a level playing field for European companies to establish business in any location in Europe as if it were a single country, a home market - a genuine home market - where decisions are based according to a real economic advantage, not a distorted one created by red tape.
Obstacles to this freedom do not only lead to suboptimal economic choices but also prevent European businesses from expanding.
The fact that some such obstacles still remain is regrettable, as a Europe-wide home market is a stepping stone to growth for European businesses and a precondition for creating more European world leaders.
Cross-border consolidation of losses - the subject of this report - is a step towards such a working home market. Currently, in this respect, the tax treatment of a group operating within a single Member State is heavily preferential compared to a cross-border situation.
Within a single Member State a company can usually offset losses incurred by its branches and subsidiaries in the taxation of the parent company. However, in the case of branches and subsidiaries in other Member States, the national legislation varies considerably.
In most cases, if consolidation of losses for tax purposes within the same group is possible, it is nevertheless granted with considerable and varying delays.
This discrepancy has grave consequences for the proper functioning of the internal market.
It distorts investment decisions, constituting a barrier to entering some markets while tending to unfairly favour the large markets where losses can more easily be absorbed.
It particularly hampers the SMEs' capacity to expand, as they frequently incur start-up losses that they cannot immediately absorb - even the time factor is very relevant to SMEs.
The existence of differing Member State legislation obviously also increases compliance costs, ill afforded by SMEs and conducive to tax engineering with larger companies.
Finally, delays in loss relief are understandably costly and burdensome to all European companies.
There is a considerable cost burden involved when capital that is legitimately recoverable is tied up, often for years, because the current national loss relief legislation will not allow consolidation without delays.
The report promotes a remedy to this by promoting the possibility to offset losses in the same tax year, which would transfer the unreasonable time burden away from the company and to the public sector.
It would also level the playing field, at the same time lowering companies' compliance costs.
It would also mean that the tax domain is one where there is still work to be done to make the most of the internal market.
This does not imply harmonising tax rates, rather that tax competition is a healthy feature of the European economy.
However, it does mean legislating to facilitate cross-border business, to establish a level playing field where investments are based on undistorted economic benefits.
I therefore welcome the Commission's activities in this area in promoting cross-border loss relief measures.
I would like to see Parliament support this urgently needed legislation, and I am grateful for the messages of support we have received during the process.
I think that Parliament's opinion on the question will also be very timely because the European Court of Justice has called for political guidance on the issue as well.
I would further like to encourage the Commission to push ahead with the CCTB as a longer-term solution, which I hope will also be supported by this House in this report.
However, the CCTB is a long-term project, the realisation of which lies far in the future.
In the mean time, cross-border laws, relief and consolidation of losses are urgently needed as an intermediate remedy to some serious problems encountered within the functioning of the internal market.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, some weeks ago, as you remember, we discussed the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness.
Cross-border loss relief is one key element for establishing a competitive internal market without obstacles and thus contributing to growth and employment.
Let me explain the importance of granting cross-border loss relief for the internal market.
Imagine a small or medium-sized enterprise which is operating successfully in its domestic market.
Once it plans to expand its operation to other Member States, to the internal market, it will not only run into problems regarding additional compliance costs. Thus, in many cases, this SME will not be able to set off any start-up losses against profits which it may continue to generate in its Member State of residence.
The non-consideration of foreign losses results in double taxation and discourages many SMEs from investing in other Member States.
With the new initiative on cross-border loss relief, large enterprises - but also SMEs in particular - could more easily extend their activities abroad and enjoy the full benefits of the internal market.
The initiative on cross-border loss relief constitutes a targeted solution in the short to medium term and represents an intermediary step.
But please note that this initiative could in the future be complementary to the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCTB), notably for companies that are not covered by the CCTB.
The initiative on cross-border loss relief is more limited in scope than the consolidation of the tax base under the CCTB would be, as this provides automatic and comprehensive off-setting of all profits and losses within a group of companies.
I highly appreciate the strong support expressed in Ms Kauppi's report for the Commission's initiative in the field of cross-border loss relief, for the coordination approach and of course also for our work on the CCTB.
Like you, I am persuaded that we should continue our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market.
on behalf of the PPE-DE group - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to thank the Commissioner and Mrs Kauppi for this report.
They have dealt with an important issue eliciting sensitive and contrasting emotions.
Two comments.
On the one hand, I feel it is important that from the standpoint of the internal market there should be no danger that a parent company and a subsidiary are at a disadvantage simply because they are operating in two different Member States, compared with companies operating in only one Member State.
So I urge that double taxation is ruled out, as the Commissioner has said, perhaps through the mechanism of electronic cooperation.
Given time factors, we could encourage efficient cross-border activity by the economic players and employ credit and exemption methods.
At the same time I feel we must be concerned when a subsidiary makes a profit and a parent company makes a loss.
Mrs Kauppi, in the new Member States, for example, this is of more interest from our point of view.
My second point about scrapping double taxation concerns the common consolidated tax base.
We still have to debate this but I have reservations.
I do not want to champion tax sovereignty but I cannot yet see clearly the effect of the common consolidated tax base.
I am also fearful that there will be a lot of political pressure for a minimum level, just as with VAT or income tax.
The proposals suggested by the Socialist and Communist, and perhaps the left-wing representatives too, demonstrate this, although the Maastricht criteria, I believe, put a stop to this.
But my fear here is that I do not know what the effect will be on the new capital-poor eastern European Members in the light of the flow of capital in the internal market.
Where will the administration be?
And will it be possible to keep individual tax concessions to counterbalance a disadvantageous infrastructure situation?
For these reasons I will abstain from these sections but I wish to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur again.
Thank you, Mr President.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we are to vote on tomorrow is symptomatic of the need for a fiscal policy at EU level.
This does not mean emasculating or curbing national tax policies; no one doubts the competence of individual Member States in this field.
It does however mean flanking and coordinating them, especially when, as in the case of corporate losses in cross-border situations, merger and relocation decisions taken by companies within and outside of Europe transcend national borders.
Clearly, not only national regulations but also bilateral agreements are insufficient, given that in this age of globalised financial markets and globalised production such phenomena occur in large numbers and exceed the confines of individual countries.
The content of the motion is the result of a consensus on many points and I shall just recall the main ones, with heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur for her constant willingness to cooperate.
Twenty-seven different tax systems hamper the smooth operation of the internal market and constitute an obstacle for businesses, especially small ones, as Commissioner Kovács has said.
The first assertion made in the text is self-evident, expressing the gravest concern over the negative impact that the different treatment of cross-border losses by Member States has on the functioning of the internal market.
The proposed solution is still transitional and temporary because the only perfect solution is a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB).
That is why we support the Commission communication as an important step in addressing the situation, while calling for adequate coordination among Member States as regards timing and solutions: I am quoting from paragraph 4.
It is important to have recalled the existence of common European institutions such as the 'European company' and the 'European cooperative society', as well as EU procedures concerning Community-scale groups of undertakings.
These must be built upon, because they enable us not only to evoke the link with industrial relations, and hence the effects on employment, but also to acknowledge the formation of Community-scale groups of undertakings that are stable.
After all, what we aim to foster is the development and implantation of a system of production with Europe, and not the individual Member State, at its heart, a system of production that does not follow the siren voices and decide tactically to diversify into other countries on the grounds of tax advantages, offsetting charges and losses wherever convenient.
The production system must be able to rely on equal treatment and avoid differential accounting according to whether the controlling undertaking is based in just one country or has a presence in various countries.
This result cannot be achieved without appropriate rules and uniform conditions.
Acknowledging that profitable tax competition would fundamentally undermine the content of this proposal does not amount to waving an ideological flag in opposition to it.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Thanks to Piia-Noora Kauppi for a good report.
She gives a balanced account of the problems and difficulties which arise on the internal market when we have 27 different tax systems.
Globalisation, which has been mentioned, has after all increased still further the need for a common approach to tax matters in the EU so that obstacles to competition can be avoided.
Different rules and bureaucracy also mean a loss of economic strength to companies and a loss of jobs in the EU.
We need clearer rules and an approach which favours enterprise, such as Mrs Kauppi proposes.
Perhaps some of us also need to remove the blinkers from our eyes.
Taxes, as we know, are a very sensitive subject.
The keywords here are tax competition and freedom of countries to determine their tax rates.
The long-term goal of the Commission is to achieve a consolidated corporate tax base.
As this is not attainable, targeted measures should be pursued within those areas which are conducive to effectiveness in the internal market.
The report reviews various possibilities for action and shows how individual countries have chosen different approaches, which is good but not enough. It is in principle also reasonable for businesses to offset losses across frontiers within a company or between companies in a consortium.
In order to facilitate such an arrangement a common approach is needed to what has to be taxed, in other words a consolidated corporate tax base.
We in the ALDE Group think that this is the right way to go.
Introduction of the common CCTB will not in itself prevent tax competition, rather the contrary.
The tax base will be common, and transparency will be better.
This new system will improve the possibilities for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to offset their losses.
Worried finance ministers - and there are many - can rest assured.
Your power to tax will stay in place.
Regarding Amendment 1, our Group would like a split vote the first part of which can deal with excise duties separately.
As regards the rest, we are inclined to abstain in the vote on Donata Gottardi's amendment to recitals E and F in order to facilitate a broad consensus and broad support in the House for this excellent report.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the rapporteur deserves credit for her work, but this is a controversial report.
We shall be voting against it and I shall now explain why.
This is an attempt to unify tax regimes within the Union, and to impose tax solutions on the Member States.
Furthermore, it also amounts to favouring cross-border companies over SMEs, and that would in turn oblige many domestic companies to set up branches and subsidiaries in other countries with no economic justification, simply to benefit from the provisions applying to cross-border companies.
I would just like to point out that for many years cross-border companies took advantage of the lack of qualifications and corruption of officials in the post-Communist countries, resorting to tax and accounting fiddles to declare losses and avoid paying tax.
The Union condoned this.
The new provision would allow such behaviour to continue and put it on a legal footing.
I am particularly surprised because there would be negative consequences for the countries of the old Union, as their taxes would be reduced.
I believe it is necessary first to resolve the problem of tax and accounting fiddles by cross-border firms within the Union and improve the fiscal apparatus, especially in the new Member States.
This would assist in the prevention and detection of tax offences.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can to some extent agree on one thing: the present situation in the EU, where there are 27 different tax systems operating alongside one another in an integrated single market with completely free movement of capital, is fatally flawed.
This is where unity really comes to an end.
Tax competition is tax dumping for the rich and the powerful and only imposes a greater tax burden on the shoulders of normal earners and consumers.
It is hardly surprising that this situation is particularly pleasing to the property owners and big companies.
What is really astonishing and alarming, however, is that this reality is still being talked up here in this House, which should really be representing the interests of more than just the elite few.
In spite of all its nuances and nuanced assessments, the Kauppi report is still just a typical piece of spin.
That goes for the position being adopted on the alleged positive impact of tax competition just as much as for the manner in which it deals with the actual subject matter, namely the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations.
It is an open secret that companies regularly use cross-border loss relief to reduce their tax bill by moving their profits to low-tax zones and low-tax countries.
They are very successful in doing this, as the statistics show: such virtual loss offsetting has in fact meant that over the last 20 years the amount of tax paid on the profits made by the multinationals has fallen continuously.
The rulings of the European Court of Justice have only served to make this tax arrangement easier and have therefore intruded massively into the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States.
All this simply fuels the race to dump corporate tax.
Those who support this development clearly want to see a Europe in which untold wealth is able to accumulate at the top of the pile, while down at the bottom poverty levels increase and the former middle classes have to survive on incomes that are falling in real terms.
We want to see a different Europe and we want a socially just taxation policy. For this reason our Group will be rejecting the present report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur claims that this initiative will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to expand their cross-border business.
But I have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals, because it is they that stand to benefit most. In my country, in Britain, the vast majority of businesses are small, and they provide for some 70% of employment.
Only a tiny proportion of these have any interest in foreign operations.
But my main objection is that it is more meddling by the European Union in taxation matters.
Judging by the EU's record of value added tax, there will be endless changes to the law.
We have had eight directives on VAT so far, and it is still a mess and prone to fraud.
Businesses operate best when there are simple, well understood rules, as Mr Schmidt has just said. The EU knows how to do only one thing, and it does it to perfection.
And that is to make things complicated.
So, contrary to the views of other Members, a much better plan would be to encourage tax competition.
Then those nations that have the lightest and simplest taxes will attract the most businesses.
(PT) Mr President, the different treatment of losses by the various Member States distorts competition in the internal market, is unfair and encourages poor fiscal practice.
We therefore welcome the Commission's initiative to propose a minimum level of harmonisation of these rules and hope that the Council will agree with this proposal.
This is an area in which better regulation is essential, particularly to eliminate the associated legal uncertainty, which has resulted in repeated recourse to the Court of Justice of the European Communities and which has contributed to increased uncertainty in economic relations, thereby harming companies and SMEs.
It is absolutely essential to ensure that the various fiscal practices are compatible with the effective functioning of the internal market.
The quality of the report prepared by the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, has enabled a broad consensus to be reached among the main political groups on its fundamental elements.
However, certain non-essential aspects of the report, in its initial version, may hinder this agreement.
In particular, in the Socialist Group's opinion, this process is not compatible with the open defence of tax competition practices.
These practices encourage artificial movements of companies, capital and persons.
Such movements frequently result in signs of breakdown both socially and environmentally and in the productive fabric.
Furthermore, in some economies, tax competition causes severe problems for the macroeconomic balance with varying consequences, particularly in terms of the level of quality and quantity of public property made available by these countries to their citizens.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that, on a subject of such strategic importance, it would be highly advantageous to present to the Commission and Council a European Parliament position with a broad basis of support. In the area of this initiative, the European Union still has a long way to go, particularly in terms of creating the oft-mentioned CCCTB or Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.
We must create the political conditions for this future work.
Agreement on this report is within our reach.
We hope that, when it comes to the final vote, the spirit of compromise among the main political groups will enable the consensus reached on its main messages to be maintained so that there is broad final approval.
Those secondary aspects that divide us politically to an extent that is not insurmountable must not be allowed to prevent this approval.
We welcome the active involvement in this process of various members of the PPE-DE Group in particular, including its rapporteur, their spirit of compromise and their spirit of openness, which have enabled a consensus to be reached on the fundamental issues of this report.
Thank you, Mr President.
(LT) I would like to draw your attention to something that we talk very much about, the various shortcomings of the internal market, and emphasize the fact that the development of the internal market gives us many advantages.
This document is important from the aspect of giving advantages to improve the labour productivity of enterprises working in the single market.
However another aspect should not be forgotten.
I represent a country where the majority of enterprises belong to European multinationals; they are not national.
Therefore, sometimes it is very difficult for us to control our economy in the macroeconomic sense as corporate strategies put the aims of the national economy, such as the fiscal balance, etc., into the shade.
We need to find an appropriate compromise between the advantages of the development of the internal market and macroeconomic stability.
I would like to draw the commissioner's attention to the need to coordinate politics with economic issues and with Mr Almunia once again.
(PL) Mr President, as I take the floor in this debate on tax treatment of losses in cross-border disputes, I should like to highlight the following issues.
Firstly, direct taxation, such as corporate tax, does not fall within the competence of the European Commission.
As a matter of principle, therefore, the Commission should not concern itself with it.
Secondly, I am surprised to see that the report contains statements disapproving of the reductions in corporate income tax rates introduced in certain Member States, notably new ones.
Thirdly, I am worried by the Commission's call for work on the introduction of a consolidated corporate tax base within the European Union to be speeded up.
The nature of such a tax, its rate and setting the tax base are some of the very few instruments that still remain within the remit of the Member States and can be used to accelerate the economic development of less developed countries.
Fourthly, a study of the Commission's proposals for a consolidated corporate tax base suggests that the aim is to ensure all Member States develop at a rate involving at most a 2% rise in GDP per annum.
In such a scenario, how would the new Member States that are 20 or 30 years behind the more developed ones ever manage to catch up?
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the issue of taxation and the possibility of transferring losses for cross-border business groups within the European Union cannot be tackled purely and simply on the basis of facilitating the cross-border operation of businesses.
This objective is, of course, important for the smooth operation of the internal market, but when it is a matter of taxing a business, as mentioned in Mrs Kauppi's report, which we are considering today, then it should be placed within the wider context of the debate about greater harmonisation of taxation within the European Union.
Provided that taxation competition does not exist on equal terms and there is no minimum requisite agreement on a common, unified tax base for companies so as to put in place uniform, transparent rules for measuring the tax base, the provision of opportunities such as this regarding tax relief for losses of a cross-border nature at present demands that we adopt a cautious approach.
This is because it involves the serious risk of distorting the Member States' taxation and revenue systems, as well as the very operation of the internal market and of competition between businesses.
Mr President, with this new form of debate I could of course use this minute to ask the Commissioner what the current state of play is concerning CCCTB in the Council, because we know that some Ministers of Finance are not very happy.
Could you please, Mr Commissioner, tell us how the debate is going on within the Council and what the 27 Member States are proposing today?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have followed the debate with great interest, and it has confirmed my conviction that the introduction of cross-border loss relief is an important factor for the deepening of the internal market.
I fully share the views of Ms Kauppi that on the surface it is about taxation, but in reality it is about the proper functioning of the internal market.
I am particularly grateful for your support with facilitating, in particular, the cross-border economic activities of the SMEs, which is very close to my heart.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Kauppi, for the very encouraging report, as well as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs for their support. The Commission can agree with most of the conclusions.
The support of Parliament is welcome as a factor which may have a positive impact on the subsequent discussion in the Council.
As suggested in the report, I can assure you that we are continuing efforts on the CCCTB and on the coordination of Member States' direct tax systems.
The CCCTB is also very close to my heart, and the reason is that I am absolutely certain that it would be of greater relative benefit to the small and medium-sized enterprises than the big multinationals.
However, I understand the concerns, and to respond to the question at the end of the debate, I want to tell you that in the Council it is on the table, but not as a concrete proposal. For the time being it is on the table as a concept, and as far as the concept is concerned, some two thirds of Member States expressed their support and less than one third expressed either doubts or opposition.
Any discussion, particularly discussion which would prejudice the current debate on the cross-border loss relief issue, would be premature because there is, for the time being, no concrete legislative proposal. In the legislative work programme of the Commission, however, there is one point which states that, in the second half of the year, we will present a concrete legislative proposal - with the necessary impact assessment - on the CCCTB.
Then we can discuss whether the concerns are relevant or not.
One more point: if there is no unanimous agreement - and for the time being I believe that there will be no unanimous agreement - we can resort to enhanced cooperation as a solution.
So, no single Member State would be forced to accept the CCCTB and to use it.
And, even in those countries that chose the CCCTB, no companies would be forced to use it, because there would be no sense in forcing companies that are not operating in the internal market - that are not doing business in the internal market - to use this common tax base.
They can stay with the domestic national base used previously.
So I share your conclusion that, in order to promote coherent development and the proper functioning of the internal market, obstacles deriving from the existence of different company tax regimes in the Member States must be tackled, preferably through common approaches and coordinated actions.
With regard to the loss offset, your report highlights several specific areas where more work needs to be done, such as addressing the particular needs of SMEs, the definition of groups and the scope for automatic information exchange.
My services will study these suggestions and comments and, where possible, bring the issues forward.
The SME aspect is already an important part of the work of Vice-President Günter Verheugen.
Another aspect, the definition of groups of companies, is an essential element of the work on the CCCTB.
I can also assure you that your recommendations for cross-border loss relief within companies and groups of companies will orient our work in the coming months.
There are several references in your report to tax avoidance.
Here it may be noted that, last December, the Commission adopted a communication on the application of anti-abuse measures in the area of direct taxation.
The Commission shares the concerns about tax avoidance expressed in your report.
Member States need to be able to prevent their tax bases from being eroded because of abuse and aggressive tax planning.
At the same time it is vital to ensure that there will be no undue restrictions to the Treaty freedoms.
By launching this latest initiative, the Commission seeks to prompt further discussions with the other institutions on how national anti-abuse measures can meet those requirements.
Your observations on tax avoidance risk will be taken into consideration.
Finally, as regards the proposed amendments to the report, the Commission would advise against amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, but it could support amendments 7 and 8, which are in line with the spirit of the communication.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I will be very brief.
I am of course happy to note that most of the groups are going to support the report tomorrow in the vote.
My group has suggested abstaining with regard to Amendments 7 and 8.
I think that it is in line with the Commission's recommendations as well that 7 and 8 will probably be adopted and that means that we have a very large majority backing the report tomorrow.
I also would like to remember a little bit the past: how difficult it was before we accepted the first company taxation directives - a Parent-Subsidiary Directive and an Interest and Royalties Directive in the 1990s - to speak about these items.
But they are now there after serious discussion, and I still believe that we can have all the practical things, like anti-abusive measures, that we can improve the Parent-Subsidiary Directive and that we can improve the workings of the Transfer Pricing Forum, and such initiatives are very much needed.
But, in the end, we need a very large solution and CCCTB.
At this time it is the best available option and we must take it seriously.
I hope that it will be done during this European Parliament term, before the 2009 elections.
Something must be done before the 2009 elections and we cannot afford to wait for Member States to come up with their ratifications and referendums.
We must act now and before the time is up for this Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
2. (
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, we are discussing Directive 95.
I had the honour of reporting on its amendment to the House in September of last year.
It is basically concerned with checking functions, as this Directive contains a large number of technical details relating to vehicles, loads and roads.
In 1996 a new comitology procedure was introduced, i.e. a regulatory procedure combined with checking.
Our committee would like to put forward that the new regulatory procedure, combined with checking, should be introduced as part of the framework of the European Commission's competencies as a condition of implementing the updated Directive 95.
The dignity of the European Parliament will not suffer as a result.
We shall avoid excessive detail in our control function.
The committee adopted this draft regulation unanimously.
I would ask the House also to speak with a unanimous voice.

Accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (13593/6/2007 - C6-0410/2007 - (rapporteur: Markus Ferber).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a long debate that has stretched over four legislative terms in the European Parliament, beginning in 1992 with the publication by the European Commission of its White Paper on the development of postal services, which was followed by the adoption of the first Postal Directive in 1997 and its revision in 2002; now, at the start of 2008, after more than 15 years, I hope we are poised to adopt jointly a rational set of rules that will help us to reconcile the interests of consumers, the interests of the companies that have hitherto enjoyed a monopoly in the provision of postal services, the interests of the competitors wishing to enter this lucrative market and the interests of those who are employed in the postal sector.
We in the European Parliament have been working very hard to achieve these goals over the past months.
I must point out, Mr President, that the clock is fast - I have not been speaking for three and a half minutes yet!
I believe we have succeeded here in the European Parliament in achieving an acceptable compromise between all these interests.
I should like to thank all those who helped to achieve it - my fellow Members of the European Parliament and particularly Brian Simpson, with whom a 14-year friendship was forged by our joint efforts in the realm of postal services.
We have been tracking this important issue together here since 1994.
I wish to thank the Commission, which has played a very constructive role, both in its proposals and at the negotiating table.
At this point, I am afraid I have to address my special thanks not to the current Slovenian Presidency but to the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, which succeeded in formulating a common position on 1 October last year.
I am especially proud, and we in the European Parliament can all be proud, of the fact that the Council, in its common position, embraced the outcome of our inter-group deliberations and incorporated more than 95% of it into the foundations of the common position.
That is a great success for the European Parliament, and it shows that Parliament can resolve such complex issues as deregulation of the market in postal services, which is further justification for the additional powers entrusted to it by the Reform Treaty.
Accordingly, in the committee discussions prior to second reading, we tried to identify areas of the common position to which we could make improvements.
We did not make life easy for ourselves, because every compromise inevitably has some aspect here or there where there might be some scope for improvement.
In December, however, we in the Transport and Tourism Committee, in an overwhelming vote of approval, established that all the points to which Parliament attached importance had actually been taken into account by the Council and that we could not make anything better.
Any amendment would have been a retrograde step.
This is why your rapporteur is now able to say that the recommendation made by a large majority of the lead committee is that the common position be adopted without amendment, and I should be delighted if that were to happen tomorrow.
We would also have set an example by wrapping up this complex issue of the liberalisation of postal services, which has exercised this House for 15 years, without once having recourse to the conciliation procedure.
Let me just remind the House that we have always managed to reach agreement at second reading.
To do so again would be the icing on the cake at the end of a long legislative process.
I therefore ask for your support and reiterate my thanks to all those who have cooperated very constructively in this process.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am greatly honoured to be here at your plenary session today.
The Commission's proposal for the directive on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services has been one of the most demanding legislative proposals for the co-legislators over the last 15 months.
When the Commission proposed it in October 2006, everyone expected endless disagreements and lively debates within our institutions about the future of one of the oldest and most traditional public services in Europe.
Discussing this matter was an extremely demanding task for the German and especially Portuguese Presidencies in 2007.
From the outset, in the debates, our institutions established the common aim of avoiding populism and demagoguery and focusing on the essential parameters of this matter, including social aspects for postal employees and the permanent financing of a universal service.
As we know, the postal sector is threatened with structural change and it must adapt to new economic and social circumstances.
The final phase of total reform of the internal postal services market offers a unique opportunity for growth to all contractors involved.
In the end, the public expects us to preserve and improve the quality and efficiency of postal services to benefit the users, regardless of where they live.
The opening up of the postal services market has so far been a success story.
New players have entered the market and new opportunities have been exploited, not only by these new players but also by the established ones.
New user services have been developed.
It is self-evident that total liberalisation of the postal services is a necessary condition for enlivening this sector and securing its existence alongside new forms of competition and alternative services.
The approach of our two institutions is further proof of the fundamental principles of protecting high-quality, reliable and affordable services for all users and disallowing discriminatory obstacles for new agents entering the market.
At the same time both the European Parliament and the Council accept that some postal services markets within the European Union operate under basically different conditions.
Therefore, when expressing its common position, the Council adopted the decision to set the end of 2010 as the common final date for liberalisation.
However, some Member States have been allowed a transitional period up to the end of 2012 to implement the new rules.
In common with the basic principle of all previous directives on postal services, the principle of subsidiarity allows the Member States to adjust the common rules to special national circumstances and ensures an independent regulatory authority to supervise the postal services market.
Ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this brief address, allow me to congratulate Mr Ferber and the rapporteurs of all the political groups involved, i.e. the shadow rapporteurs, on their contributions to our fruitful and constructive discussions.
Although we did not always fully agree with their specific remarks, I would like to remind you that the Council included a number of appropriate changes in its common position in November 2007, thereby demonstrating its political decisiveness, openness and constructive flexibility.
I would especially like to emphasise the fine work of the Commission in the whole process of common decision-making and its commitment to the effective support and guidance of the Member States in all questions relating to the implementation of the new directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will receive the final decision and again acknowledge our principal agreement according to the provisions of the Council common position and the recommendation by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on 9 December last year.
We are certain that we have found the right balance between the different aims and have openly and sensitively dealt with the political challenges without endangering the legal security of postal services contractors and consumers.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your cooperation and for the text, which I am certain will be approved, and thank you for your attention.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, tomorrow the European Parliament should take a historic decision that marks the end of a process launched more than 15 years ago.
The Third Postal Directive brings to a good end the well prepared gradual process of full market opening.
What today appears a clear and obvious solution was far from uncontested when the discussion started.
On 18 October 2006 the Commission presented its proposals.
Intense and constructive negotiations in the institutions followed.
It was eventually the European Parliament, through its report at first reading of 11 July 2007, that paved the way for the compromise result in front of you today.
Many in this House have actively contributed to this important result, and - on behalf of my colleague Commissioner McCreevy - I wish to pay tribute particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and his fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups who have shaped the compromise.
The same goes for the Finnish, German, Portuguese and - last but not least - the Slovene Presidency.
Some remarks on substance: the text that is now on the table is balanced.
It takes into account the interests of different political groups and Member States.
The Commission's proposal had envisaged an earlier date for market opening, confirming the target date set by the existing Postal Directive.
Two additional years is a substantial period.
It will give all operators time to complete their preparations.
It should not, however, lead to complacency.
What is important for the postal sector, its customers, its operators and its employees is that there is a final and unconditional date for full market opening.
The common position provides for fair conditions and requires us to do away with market entry barriers.
A limited number of amendments have been tabled for tomorrow's vote.
Mostly these are amendments that were already rejected by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in December.
As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, observed at the time, these amendments do not bring added value for the internal market, for postal users, or for postmen and women.
There is a momentum to finalise the process of postal reform.
To sum up, the text in front of you is, on balance, good in substance, and, if you look at its main provisions, you will agree with me that it is faithful to our objective: real market opening not as an end in itself but as the means through which we pursue the broader objective of a high quality, highly efficient and sustainable postal sector adapted to the needs of the 21st century.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, in recent years all of us, myself included, have repeatedly lamented the fact that, even in the case of major legislative projects, most of the seats on the Council bench have remained empty.
We should therefore make a point of expressing our pleasure at the high-level representation of the Slovenian Presidency at this important legislative debate and at the fact that Slovenia is already entering, as it were, into the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, of course, it has just ratified.
The internal market in postal services has been a long time coming.
We are delighted that, if all goes well, this present draft of ours will help to bring the process to a successful conclusion.
The initial proposal from the Commission was, in principle, coherent and acceptable, but for us in the European Parliament the basic principle was, in many cases, too broadly applied, and we felt that major points of detail remained unresolved.
In this respect it was a good thing that, under the direction of our rapporteur, Markus Ferber, whom I warmly congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, our committee, acting by a very comfortable majority, was able to add numerous important elements to the Commission proposal at first reading and to interpret and flesh out its provisions.
On the financial side in particular we have added an extra option - an important one, since it ensures that a key issue is not disregarded.
We reinforced the social provisions, especially on matters such as working conditions, working hours and leave entitlements.
In particular, we introduced a temporary reciprocity clause to ensure that the Directive does not yield windfall profits by letting a few remaining monopolists expand their operations into deregulated markets.
In return we agreed to the entry into force of the Directive being postponed by two years.
We believe that the proposal was generally well balanced, and we feel vindicated by the actions of the Council, which very largely endorsed the position of the European Parliament.
We should accept that position tomorrow and share the satisfaction of the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur with the outcome.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to thank Markus Ferber for his report and his hard work over many years.
The PSE Group accepts that a great deal of Parliament's first-reading position has been accepted by the Council, and this will guarantee the universal service; it will guarantee the financing of that service; it will also recognise that social protection must be in place, and it delays the implementation by two years to the end of 2010 for all the old Member States and 2012 for the new ones.
In my view this is a good deal.
There are those who still fight the anti-liberalisation battle.
But that battle was lost over 15 years ago when Parliament accepted - against my advice at the time - to liberalise the postal services sector.
Some of us in this Parliament have delayed the full implementation for those long 15 years, but there comes a time, eventually, when we have to face up to reality.
Although, personally, I would like to see a second reading with no amendments, my group believe it is right to clarify the financing of the universal service and to protect those services presently provided for the visually impaired and the blind.
So we will be supporting amendments 1, 2, 6, 18 and 19.
We must ensure that postal services are able to compete, not necessarily against each other, but against other technologies.
But we need the playing field to be level, and I hope, with the reservations I have outlined, that we can conclude our work on this dossier based on our first-reading position and get back to the most important issue of providing a reliable, regular and affordable postal service to our citizens, and to recognising the important work done by all those postmen and women throughout the European Union.
Finally, when Markus Ferber and I started work on this dossier, neither of us had any grey hairs.
Now look at the both of us!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, like all my colleagues, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his work.
This was a job that was initiated a long time ago and during the course of which we have had significant moments of convergence and some moments of constructive discussion.
As far as my position and that of my group is concerned, there has never been any conflict of principles or ideology against the idea of liberalisation, which we all agree with and support, while, of course, seeking to ensure the guarantees that are necessary for a universal service.
In the current proposal for the Directive, which was approved by the Parliament during its first reading and then reconsidered by the Council, we can see that this guarantee is there, even if some of the conditions could be made more precise, specific and detailed.
We do not want to be like those who cannot see the wood for the trees, but, on the other hand, nor do we want to ignore the fact that sometimes the devil is in the detail.
For this reason we would have preferred that, as regards some of the issues concerning authorisations, concerning ensuring proper competition and also concerning tariff payments between the operator charged with providing the universal service and other individual services, concerning rights and responsibilities as regards network access, that some of the questions had been gone into in more detail.
We would have preferred this, but the majority of the views taken in Parliament, which were also represented among the committee, was probably that making the guarantees more precise was unnecessary, and preferred instead not to run the risk of coming to a complicated agreement.
In summary, at this time we hold this standpoint and, as regards the amendments concerning conditions for the blind and the visually impaired, we would like to state clearly that, if these and only these amendments were to force a settlement to be reached, we would not be in favour.
However, if other amendments should be approved we shall also vote in favour.
Otherwise, we would vote against all the amendments put forward.
Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council.
I should first like to thank Mr Ferber for his work in seeking a compromise between Parliament and the Council in such a politically sensitive area as postal services.
I should like to emphasise that the objective difficulties in liberalising the approach to universal services, mainly for the new Member States, were reflected in the directive as an adequate additional time-limit of two years to reserve these services.
At the same time a sound legal framework has been put in place to guarantee universal services.
I therefore believe that the ball is now in the court of the Member States' authorities.
Despite the difficulties encountered by postal enterprises in some Member States, including my country, Latvia, I believe that liberalisation of the market will resolve the seemingly hopeless situation of outdated postal service providers.
As regards tomorrow's vote, I invite you not to support the aforesaid proposals, because the Member States must make use of their competence also in respect of the visually impaired.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am afraid the facts of the matter prevent me from joining the celebrations.
Fact number one: who will benefit?
Those consumers who live in cities and love to receive advertising material in their letterboxes.
They will benefit.
So will businesses that specialise in mass mailings and postal advertising campaigns.
Those people who are blind or visually impaired, on the other hand, will not benefit.
I therefore implore you to support our amendment on this matter.
There will be no benefit to the employees of the postal services either, who will be working for low pay and will be under enormous pressure, which can only increase in the envisaged conditions.
Another group that will not benefit are people who live in the country or in remote areas and will have to rely on private postal services, for we shall see a creeping erosion of service levels down to the minimum possible and permissible.
In particular, there will be no benefit to taxpayers, who must once again finance the universal service that was previously funded internally, as it were, being effectively subsidised by revenue from mass mailings and private postal services.
For these reasons I come down against the directive.
I believe it is misguided.
Competition is good, but care must be taken to ensure that it takes place on a level playing field.
That has not been done in this case.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, postal services are a labour-intensive public service.
In the second half of the nineteenth century the states of Europe decided that they needed to have their own monopoly on postal services because the private sector was not up to the job.
There have always been private companies that tried to get round this situation.
They offered cheaper services, but selectively, choosing the busiest parts of the postal delivery service and offering poorer working conditions and conditions of employment.
Since the 1990s a political majority have tried to create ever broader scope for such companies, and this proposed decision gives them almost an entirely free hand.
My Group expects this to result in poorer delivery services for consumers, deteriorating conditions for workers and extra costs for the Member States to maintain and restore their universal postal services.
Even now that the three biggest Groups have agreed a compromise on deadlines and accompanying measures, my Group still sees this choice as a step backwards.
In addition to measures to improve certain details, such as stricter guarantees for blind customers and for staff, we therefore propose that this liberalisation should be rejected.
This would also be in line with the recent thumbs down given by voters in the German city of Leipzig to the sale of public undertakings.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I note the phrase 'a fixed and irrevocable date'.
One thing EU designer Jean Monnet hated about democracy was that nothing is irrevocable.
No democratic government can bind its successor with the irrevocable.
There is a democratic deficit in the EU because the ever-closer Union was designed as irrevocable.
No openings for democracy.
The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want.
It is a one-way street.
The French and Dutch people voted against this irrevocable union.
Ignoring them and introducing the same failed constitution proves my point.
You are failing to learn from history.
The Soviet Union went.
Hitler's Tausendjähriges Reich lasted 12 years.
The backlash you are creating by denying the people a referendum will bring this intolerant EU empire down as sure as day follows night.
(HU) Madam President, by the end of 2012 postal services will be fully liberalised, and the common market will have been achieved in this area too.
Since opening the market will have different impacts on the markets in individual Member States, what we have achieved through the legislation is that the market will be opened step by step.
We have also achieved a situation in which the relevant post offices can keep the revenue they have at their disposal until the end of the derogation period, and I personally put this down as a result.
After a long time, European regulation has been born, so that puts everyone in a competitive situation.
Particular thanks to the rapporteur for this.
In other words, this regulation will not mean disadvantages for competing companies after the opening of the market, but new prospects.
Madam President, all this is only half a victory if the next steps are not taken.
What are they?
Firstly, the post offices that enjoy the derogation must focus, in the years to come, on being able to meet the requirements supported by European competition, that is, that they really do use the time benefits that they are being given now.
Secondly, state regulation and policies must ensure that, whilst the post office is slimmed down with the slogan of becoming competitive, universal service really must be ensured at a corresponding level.
We should not forget that responsibility for service will still be the obligation of the state.
In fact, regulation was born so that European citizens, wherever they live, even in the smallest places, should have access to postal services, at a suitable price and of suitable quality.
Thank you for your attention.
(FR) Madam President, I think that the issue we shall be voting on tomorrow is a historic one, because the post has been a public service from the early days, especially since monarchies.
That was because the distribution of mail is strategic, and it also ensured a universal and fast service.
We have just put an end to public control of postal services, or we shall be ending it tomorrow, to replace it with a largely deregulated postal market.
What is proposed in this directive will first of all be a wonderful market for lawyers and legal practitioners, because it is not harmonisation.
Each Member State can decide on its own method of financing and there are four different methods.
The directive also proposes something completely paradoxical: compensating for the financing of the universal service through State subsidies where, in some countries, what was not financially viable was financed by equalisation when that was viable.
I think we are making a mistake.
Time will tell, but we already have some indications of that today.
Over EUR 880 million have been invested in the postal service in the United Kingdom.
In Spain it has just been announced that, because of the pressure of competition, rural areas will no longer receive a direct postal service.
The Germans are having problems in bringing the minimum wage into line with the postal services market.
My feeling is that we are now benefiting companies, we are going to let them cream off the best part of the market, but we are not serving the general interest in postal services or the external competitiveness of the European Union.
(NL) Madam President, I support the compromise reached by Mr Ferber and approved by the Council because I am in favour of an open market for postal services.
I think this directive gives the Member States sufficient scope to ensure that their markets are opened up in a proper manner, and that there are different service-providers competing for customers on the basis of guaranteed quality.
It is certainly not the intention that the Member States should use this scope to prevent their markets from being opened up, although this is also a risk.
It would be easy to apply this directive so that new firms faced such strict requirements that no one new would bother with the letter post.
If this is how the Member States apply the directive, then we will have adopted a fine piece of legislation, but will have changed nothing in practice for postal customers.
I think we certainly have to approve the text, but I would ask the Commission to make sure that the aim of creating an open market in postal services is not circumvented by measures taken by the Member States.
I see that the rapporteur's country, for example, has recently taken measures that have actually closed down the postal market in Germany again.
(GA) Mr President, the postal service in Ireland has a central part to play in the lives of rural communities, especially for rural dwellers and people in remote regions who have no neighbours around.
So I welcome the provision for universal service - something that is vitally important for people in Ireland and, I am sure, every other Member State as well.
I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for sticking firmly to that principle.
For the benefit of customers it should be laid down in our draft documents, and in this connection I also welcome the new financial service being set up by the Irish Post Office in Ireland.
This shows that postal service providers can gear themselves to new market requirements while continuing to provide their universal postal service.
In addition, I should like to welcome the recent ruling by the Court of Justice to the effect that a postal service provider is entitled to enter into an agreement regarding the distribution of social welfare payments.
(PT) The Council agreed to the full opening of the market in postal services at EU level from 31 December 2010 during the Portuguese Presidency, applying competition rules to what some say should be a public service to create an internal market in postal services.
'That's great', the Portuguese Prime Minister will say.
That decision, however, represents a great blow to the public postal services, particularly with the abolition of the reserved areas, setting in motion a process to dismantle them and subsequently hand them over to profit-driven transnationals, and at public expense to boot, jeopardising the rights of the nation and of workers in the sector.
If there were any doubts as to the true significance of the inclusion of the 'protocol on services of general interest' in the draft Treaty, this directive will dispel them: continuation of the dismantling and destruction of public services, threatening their ownership and provision by democratically managed and controlled public companies.
Hence our proposal to reject this directive.
(SV) Madam President, the post is one of the public services which the people of our countries, both old and young, value most highly.
Hence the formulation of the decision is absolutely vital.
In previous debates on the directive I have expressed fears that the needs of thinly populated areas might not be catered for.
It was not clear that the same service would be guaranteed for everyone.
On one occasion during question time with Commissioner McCreevy I was promised that there would be no change in the requirement to provide a universal service.
We now have a compromise which gives guarantees that those of us who live in thinly populated areas will have our post collected and delivered five days a week just like everyone else.
I will support the compromise to the Postal Directive tomorrow.
Let us hope that this leads to a better service, lower prices and a more effective postal system for everyone when we deregulate the single market in one further sector.
(NL) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, most warmly for the work he has done.
He managed to get Parliament to agree on this difficult issue at first reading, even though both he and I felt that we should have gone a step further.
In the end, however, our united stance was what guided the Council, and so I too wholeheartedly agree with the common position.
Members of the Socialist and Green Groups have unfortunately got cold feet and cannot see the enormous opportunities that this directive will offer for new businesses and jobs.
I am absolutely convinced of this, and examples in a number of Member States back me up.
But everything will now depend on the European Commission keeping to the directive, so that it does not remain a dead letter.
If the directive is introduced, it will certainly achieve the aim of opening up the markets.
There will be better services for consumers, and not what Germany is doing, squeezing new players, and not just new players but new businesses too, new services, new jobs, out of the market on the pretext of social protection.
So I am happy with the response that I received yesterday from the European Commission.
I understand that the Commission is to investigate the situation in Germany.
I would urge you to do so, and quickly, because the new players on the German market are in serious trouble, and it would be absolutely terrible if things do not work out, as well as setting exactly the wrong precedent.
I predict that France and other countries will follow, and then we will achieve absolutely nothing in the end.
So the Commission has a huge responsibility here.
I hope that you will use every possible legal channel and also bring political pressure to bear to ensure that this directive is properly applied to the European postal market.
(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, postal services are of major importance to the economic and social life of communities.
Therefore we must guarantee the accessibility of postal services and above all we must ensure the quality of those services.
Full liberalization of the postal service market, including deliveries weighing less than 50 grams, will allow increased competition, the emergence of new operators and the creation of new jobs.
However, I would like to dwell on several important issues.
First of all, it is essential for universal service to be guaranteed and for every citizen to be able to receive mail, irrespective of whether they live on a mountain top or on an island.
Secondly, we must ensure decent working conditions for people in this line of work; in particular, we must ensure that there are social guarantees concerning jobs and incomes.
Thirdly, for Member States to guarantee universal service, it is essential for them to define as soon as possible the means of funding the universal service.
The Directive allows Member States flexibility in this regard.
Fourth, as we live in an increasingly digitized world, it is essential that mail operators should diversify their activity so as to provide electronic services, as well.
Some Member States may have two extra years before postal services are fully liberalised.
No matter when liberalisation takes place, mail operators should have an effective management which should guarantee the high quality of those services.
(PL) Madam President, allowing private operators to provide postal services is a controversial decision.
Time will tell whether it is beneficial for consumers.
We must remember that in some of the new Member States with a lower level of development, institutions defending the interests of competition and consumers are weakly anchored in the public conscience.
There is a danger of disrupting the balance between the interests of capital and those of the consumer.
Setting the date at 2012 is therefore to be welcomed.
At the same time, I would suggest that before 2012 an analysis be made of the operation of the postal services market in those countries that have already adopted the new rules, with a view to identifying and preventing any irregularities in the remaining countries.
I also consider that an operator providing public services should be rewarded by the authorities and not as - the authors of the report suggest - merely compensated.
Years of work on this legislation have turned Mr Ferber's hair grey.
I trust the introduction of the new regulations will not cause him further distress and result in actual hair loss.
(DE) Madam President, it is surely very obvious that Mr Ferber's position and those of Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other Members are poles apart.
I believe it is wrong to treat privatisation and liberalisation of public services as the standard response to globalisation.
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach.
In a referendum in Leipzig last weekend, 80% of the electorate, or rather of those who voted, rejected privatisation, thereby preventing the city council from carrying out any more privatisations for the next three years.
Let me also tell you that it is simply not the case that this directive we are discussing today incorporates real safeguards to protect people - employees - from social dumping.
We have seen how the introduction of minimum wages in the postal services in Germany has met with resistance from those very companies that have built the foundations of their business on rock-bottom wages.
I also have serious concerns about the implications of public institutions awarding contracts to such companies.
(PL) Madam President, work has been going on for over 15 years on liberalisation of the postal sector, which is worth over EUR 90 billion a year in the Union as a whole.
Today we are on the eve of voting on and inscribing such legislation in the history of the Union, and I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
The present version of the project is a broad compromise in which the main aims appear to have been achieved: full implementation of the internal market in postal services, mainly through termination of the mail monopoly, and assured continuation of a high-quality, low-cost public service.
The present version of the directive is not, however, as ambitious as the Commission's original proposal.
In the course of the deliberations, departure from the idea of liberalisation in favour of a gradual, rather cautious opening of the postal market for letters weighing less than 50 grammes became increasingly apparent.
This is reflected in the compromise date for the entry into force of the directive, specifically in the case of new Member States and countries with small populations, small geographical areas and public service clauses.
The date of 31 December 2012 for Member States that joined the Union in 2004 seems unnecessarily distant.
I realise it is part of the negotiated compromise, which we accept, but it may well put a brake on the proposed changes.
I fear such a long period - over four years - for the entry into force of the directive will simply slow down changes which, in the case of a two-year period, for example, would take effect almost immediately.
Finally, I want to support Mrs Pleštinská's call for clauses concerning the blind and visually handicapped to be reinstated in the proposed directive.
They are missing from the present version.
(NL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members who have helped to achieve a result that is a considerable improvement on the original Commission proposal.
I understand why many of us want to leave it at that, but behind the positive elements that have been added to the directive there also lurk a number of dangers.
Nothing has actually been achieved yet, because the Member States are being given a lot of responsibility on two crucial points.
Firstly, there are still a lot of question marks over how the universal service is to be funded.
The Member States have a number of options here, but it is not always clear whether these really work.
In many cases this will lead to all sorts of disputes, including legal ones.
I therefore feel it would be useful to make two things clear: firstly, that the Member States are under an obligation to guarantee the universal service and funding for it whatever the circumstances, and secondly, that the Member States must be required to get their house in order and to prepare for this new situation thoroughly and in good time.
The second important point is the social field.
Here it is important to point out that this directive allows the Member States to require all postal operators, through a licensing system, to comply with the same collective agreements, for instance, or other minimum standards.
This is a good idea, but it is still only optional, and it will be applied differently from one country to another.
In a word, I think the directive could be tightened up, and this has nothing to do with having cold feet, but reflects the fact that a free market has to be regulated and liberalisation needs to be carefully prepared.
(EL) Madam President, we are dissatisfied with the European Commission, the Council and our rapporteur, because they have made no reference to fluctuations in the number of workers in the sector, working conditions, working hours or pay.
Similarly, provision has been made neither for an effective check on tariff policies for businesses, nor for the private monopoly situations in parcel transport and express post.
Furthermore, the report stresses the stable employment in Member States, despite local fluctuations, but no data has been produced to demonstrate this.
In these circumstances, then, it is not possible to make a proper evaluation in the interests of workers.
Finally, it should be emphasised that the Council has, in a certain sense, ratified Parliament's amendments while allowing for plenty of discussion on the social consequences both for employees of services and for consumers.
(DE) Madam President, the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services amply illustrates the truth of the saying 'Good things come to those who wait'.
Even I can support this draft on the table, the result of fifteen years of hard bargaining.
I happen to be one of those who would rather have preserved the monopoly of national postal administrations for letters below the 50-gramme threshold.
Now this last stage in the controlled deregulation of the postal market is set to take effect on 1 January 2011.
In view of the structure of the postal services in Luxembourg, the statutory requirement to employ volunteers from the armed forces in the public service and the resulting costs, I could not have subscribed to rapid and insufficiently controlled deregulation of the market in postal services, because that could have had intolerable consequences for postal staff and customers.
For the first reading, I therefore asked the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to allow for a two-year extension of the transposition deadline for small countries with relatively few inhabitants so that they could continue to limit the provision of certain services to the universal-service provider, and I thank him for his understanding.
I had discreetly circumscribed this arrangement in order to ensure that Luxembourg benefited from the exemption, but the Ministers preferred to preclude any misunderstanding by naming the relevant countries.
This keeps us safe.
The important thing is that the universal-service requirement guarantees the collection of mail and its rapid delivery to the designated residential or business address on each working day, even in remote or sparsely populated areas.
The external funding that might be needed to cover the net cost of the universal service, and hence the question of affordable rates, has also been satisfactorily regulated.
Lastly, the best possible measures have been taken to safeguard permanent skilled jobs with universal-service providers and to guarantee adherence to terms of employment and social-security schemes based on existing legal provisions or collective agreements, contrary to what the Left would have us believe.
They ought to read the wording of the draft.
It also expressly stipulates that preparations for the deregulation of the postal market must take account of social considerations.
On the motion tabled by our philanthropic missionaries regarding free postal services for the visually impaired, I personally do not see why wealthy people with impaired vision should send their mail free of charge at the taxpayer's expense.
In any case, those who propose this amendment are barking up the wrong tree, because it is the Member States that guarantee such arrangements.
Subsidiarité oblige!
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the gradual opening up of the postal services market is an important milestone in achieving the internal market.
It will contribute to ending special rights within the postal sectors, and it will set a specific and irrevocable date for opening the market, ensuring a sustainable, high level of universal service.
Opening the market will intensify competition, and so the level of service can be improved with regard to quality, price and opportunities for choice.
This measure will promote the harmonisation of the fundamental principles relating to the regulation of postal services, and will probably produce lower tariffs as well as better and more innovative services, and greater conditions for growth and employment will still be created.
The amendment to the Directive is the result of an exemplary compromise, a compromise that took into account the differences arising from the historical and economical characteristics of the Member States.
It pays regard to the fact that preparing for liberalisation requires more time in some Member States, mainly those in Central Eastern Europe.
At the same time, taking into account the interests of others and in order to prevent distortion of competition in the market in countries where the postal sector is already fully liberalised, the postal services of countries that are not yet opening their market may not provide services until the derogation deadline at the end of December 2012.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his work, but naturally thanks are also due to Mr Simpson, the shadow rapporteur.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson for the quality of their report and all those Members and parties involved for their openness during the negotiating procedure.
This liberalisation of the market in postal services is still far from achieving a competitive market in which consumers and companies are the biggest winners.
I therefore argued that the Commission's approach might not sufficiently guarantee the universal service.
I accordingly supported the shadow rapporteur Mr Simpson's position on the need to guarantee the universal service and to establish a compensation fund, and on the commitment to open up postal services below 50 grammes in 2010, or in special cases, such as the new Member States with outermost regions, by 31 December 2012.
I am also pleased with regard to those states with the special provisions included, though I must point out that they may not be sufficient, in which case additional measures will be required.
In terms of employment, I am delighted with the addition introduced previously to make it obligatory for a report to be submitted on the overall development of employment in the sector, the working conditions applied by all operators within a Member State, and any future measures.
I am very pleased with the common position achieved, but support the amendments submitted by my colleagues Mr Savary, Mr El Khadraoui and Mrs Ayala Sender, among others, and by my parliamentary group, since they reinforce the idea of the need for a considered process of liberalisation to reinforce equal universal access, development and employment.
For all these reasons I urge the plenary to support this report and the Council, and to support Parliament's position.
Madam President, Parliament should pass our amendments to restore compulsory free postal services for blind people to this directive.
Mr Vizjak, you say you were open and flexible and yet you completely rebuffed Parliament's amendments on compulsory free services for blind people.
We have heard Mr Orban say tonight, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, that our amendments do not bring added value to postal users.
Mr Orban, are not blind people postal users?
And is not the real added value you are talking about the actual added costs that blind people are going to have to be forced to pay?
To Mr Ferber, I regret to say that I believe you were wrong to make a deal, dropping this requirement which Parliament passed at first reading.
Yesterday you also failed to answer my question: is there a threat to blind people's services?
I hope you will today.
Because if there is not, what objection can you have to putting this into the directive?
If there is, that shows why we need to put it in.
In Italy, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, the post office, not the government, provides this free service.
New and existing providers in a liberalised market will inevitably seek to cut costs; blind people must not be the victims.
After liberalisation in New Zealand, blind people's services were ended.
We must not let it happen here.
Finally, for those who tell us that they are sympathetic to disabled people but this is not the right place or way to do it, you told us that about the Lifts Directive and the Buses and Coaches Directive, other single market legislation.
But Parliament said no, and we insisted on binding access for disabled people.
Today, again, we must insist on compulsory rights for Europe's blind and partially-sighted people.
(SK) Madam Chairman, thank you for giving me the floor.
The common position adopted by the Council does not include the amendments concerning free postal services for blind people in spite of the fact that at first reading the European Parliament voted to maintain free postal services for blind people following liberalisation of the European postal market.
I intended to vote in favour of Amendment 3 tabled by Eva Lichtenberger, in which Parliament's position at first reading is reiterated.
Following today's discussion with the rapporteur, Marcus Ferber, I was informed that approval of any of the amendments would jeopardise a previously agreed compromise on the adoption of the Directive on accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services at second reading, which could mean having to enter into conciliation.
I realise the importance of adopting this Directive.
When transposed into national law, the Member States will be able to solve this issue in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
I would therefore urge all of the Member States to provide free postal services for blind and partially sighted people in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and universal service obligations.
(PL) Madam Chairman, I would also like to support the amendments concerning visually impaired persons.
If the European Union declares to all and sundry that it tolerates no discrimination, then access to postal services must also be equal for all, and for the visually impaired that means assisted access.
Madam President, this directive is yet another example of how one-size-fits-all, incompetent EU legislation adversely affects the lives of British people.
This directive is the reason why post offices are closing and why postal workers will lose their jobs.
Post offices play a vital role in the community, especially for the old, the poor, the immobile and the disabled.
This is just one of a multitude of EU laws that have damaged, and will continue to damage, my country.
The British people know this, and this is one of the reasons why they are being denied a referendum on the EU Constitution.
If it is ratified, they can look forward to a lot more of the same.
Madam President, I believe the rapporteur has, in general - though not entirely - achieved a fair balance.
The universal service provision will ensure consumers have full access to postal services and Member States still have the flexibility to determine the most effective and efficient mechanism to guarantee the USO.
The USO will also ensure that sufficient access points are established to take full account of the needs of users in rural areas and sparsely populated areas, and I know this will be welcome, particularly in my own country, Ireland.
Initially, I have to say I had some reservations about the impact on postal workers, but Member States still have the authority to regulate employment conditions and collective bargaining in the sector, where this does not lead to unfair competition.
Finally, I want to say that I support the amendment that there should be an obligation to supply free services for blind and partially-sighted persons.
I disagree with Commissioner Orban - or is it Commissioner McCreevy? - I do believe this will provide added value, because, in a fully liberalised market, free services for blind or partially-sighted persons will disappear, and it will be added value if we can guarantee to them that they will continue.
(SK) Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Chairman.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report, thanks to which the long-awaited Directive will soon enter into force.
This Directive will mean that from 1 January 2009 the internal market in Community postal services will be fully accomplished.
I am particularly pleased that the principle of subsidiarity has been maintained and that concrete implementation has been left to the Member States, which will draw up legislation that is specific to their own situation.
However, I would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people, especially blind or partially sighted people, and their right to avail of free postal services.
I call on my fellow Members to support the relevant amendments that were tabled in plenary this week and that were adopted by Parliament at first reading.
These services are appropriate and crucial for this section of the population: people with exceptionally low income, areas with very high unemployment levels and people in difficult social situations, not to mention those affected by social exclusion.
Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.
I congratulate the rapporteur for the work done.
I think the public believe this is already happening because in many Member States there is not a postal service of equal value between the regions.
I am glad to see that there will be subsidiarity on this issue and the Member States will decide the best way to implement the principle of a deregulated market.
I need to support my intergroup chairman, Richard Howitt, on the issue of disability.
Unfortunately, the point was raised that rich blind people will benefit.
Sadly, there are too few rich blind people in Europe and globally.
I wish we could stand up and say that they were all rich and, indeed, famous, but it is not the case.
I think we have to make a big stand on this, just to show that, while Europe is about freedom of movement of capital and services, it is also concerned about those who have no voice and those who have no sight.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Today's lively debate has shown that there are many justifiably differing opinions about the regulation of this traditional and oldest public service.
It was also right that many different opinions and concerns were expressed.
However, we must stress that the proposed text is a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the opening up of the internal market in postal services, securing competitiveness and the added value that comes with it, and, on the other hand, consumer protection and protection of the rights of consumers and the rights of vulnerable consumer groups and those living in remote areas.
In short, in the Council's estimation, it is a good compromise text and I would like to express my support for that opinion.
We also appreciate the intention behind certain amendments, but through discussions in previous debates a final compromise solution came to light.
We are therefore of the opinion that this is a good text and I hope you will exercise much political wisdom tomorrow when you have the final chance to support this text.
The Commission. - First of all I would like to extend my thanks to all the participants in the debate and stress that this debate has proven the MEPs' great interest in this dossier.
This interest is closely linked to the crucial role that postal services play in the European economy and in the everyday life of European citizens.
I would like to stress that the completion of this process will ensure a consistently high quality of universal service for all European citizens and for the business community.
The main goal of postal reform is to benefit all consumers and postal service users, including special needs groups.
In this context, I paid particular attention to the contributions of several Members who spoke about the continuation of free service provision for the blind and partially sighted.
The European Commission is particularly sympathetic to these concerns.
We believe that the liberalisation of the market will not change this, and that international obligations will continue to be met in full.
I would like to underline that the common position specifies that market liberalisation will not prevent the provision of free services to the blind and partially sighted.
Under Article 23 of the Directive, the European Commission must prepare a report on the application of this Directive, including information about the groups mentioned above.
The Commission believes that the Directive as it now stands, in the current format to which the European Parliament has contributed significantly, is the best legal framework, that will lead to high quality and sustainability in European postal services, while complying with international obligations.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the report, as prepared by Mr Markus Ferber and adopted by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, should be supported.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to make just a few remarks.
Firstly, I should be happier if those Members who delivered impassioned speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate.
That did rather disappoint me, I must say.
I am referring specifically to Members such as Mrs Lichtenberger.
Secondly, I must point out that we are talking here about liberalisation and not privatisation.
The proprietary structure of existing postal services does not interest the European Union and is not mentioned in this directive.
Thirdly, let me say that, 500 years ago when the first postal services were created, it was private undertakings that provided postal services.
Not until later did governments decide they could do it better.
So let us have no distortions of history please.
Fourthly, I should like to remind the House that government monopolies are also abused.
I am glad that Mrs Zimmer drew attention to that problem.
In point of fact, she comes from a region in which the state most certainly abused its postal monopoly until 1990, to the detriment of innocent people.
This is another point that needs to be made forcefully in the present debate.
Let me get one thing straight: we did not forget blind people in this legislation.
They are included, but they are included in a way that accords with the spirit of this directive.
Through its provisions, the European Union is telling the Member States that they are responsible for the universal service and for funding the fulfilment of universal-service obligations, that they are responsible, through licensing and authorisation procedures, for ensuring that certain services, such as postal services for blind people, can be maintained in the long term.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his announcement that the Commission intends to give consideration to this matter in its report under Article 23 of the Directive.
We have not forgotten anything; we have not forgotten blind people.
Nevertheless, I do wonder whether blind people should have free access, guaranteed by European legislation, and wheelchair users should not.
That is something else to ponder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 31.1.2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the approval, at second reading, of the Council common position amending the 1997 postal services directive with a view to full accomplishment of the internal market in postal services and I congratulate my worthy German colleague, Markus Ferber, for the huge amount of work he has done.
I am pleased that the Council accepted all the key aspects of the European Parliament's position, particularly deferral of general market opening until 31 December 2010, with a two-year extension for those Member States that have joined the Union since 2004; the principle of a universal service comprising at least one delivery and collection five days a week for every EU citizen, with a sufficient number of access points maintained in rural, remote or sparsely populated regions; and observance of subsidiarity with regard to social considerations - a matter on which I hope the social partners will work at European level.
I am sorry that provision has not been included for the creation of a European regulatory mechanism.
My final point is this: I am keen to see operators reaching agreement soon on the introduction of a European stamp for 50 g letters and I intend to take a policy initiative to that end at an early date.
in writing. - (RO) The common position satifies the demands made by Parliament in its votes for the first reading, as well as the amendments proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
However, the Commission has yet to provide clear research on the impact that the liberalisation of postal services is likely to have on employment.
In its opinion, the Committee asked for an impact assessment of the effects of this measure on the five million or more jobs related to or depending on postal services.
This study is facilitated by the fact that postal services have already been liberalised in several EU Member States, such as the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands.
Experience in those countries has not so far indicated that liberalisation has led to an increase in the number of jobs in this sector, or to an increase in their quality.
I believe that certain protection mechanisms should be allowed for situations where the emergence of new postal service providers on the market will lead to massive redundancy.
One of the mechanisms available to the companies and Member States affected could be the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the road to the liberalisation of postal services is getting longer, and for that the European Parliament is partly to blame, having extended the European Commission's deadline by two years.
The positions taken by national delegations reflect the varying situation on the markets of the 27 countries.
Sweden, the United Kingdom and Finland, as front runners of the open market, as well as Germany and the Netherlands, which have gone a long way in that direction, all see the final deadline as a victory for protectionism.
Starting from their model of a state-controlled economy, the new Member States consider not only the original proposal of 2009 but also the compromise deadline of 2011 as a threat to jobs in the postal sector.
Poland, for example, has some 100 000 people employed by Poczta Polska, which is incapable of facing open competition in the medium term.
Having found allies in public services in western Europe, first and foremost France's La Poste, they have succeeded in negotiating special conditions that postpone the free market in practice to the end of 2012.
In the event, the corporate interest of the postal workers has prevailed over that of the customers, who were sorely tried during the Christmas peak period in December 2007, when the incapability of the postal monopoly was harshly demonstrated.
The slow progress made in liberalising this sector of the European market, which began as far back as 1989 with the first draft directive, shows the strength of the corporate interests defending the status quo against an extension of the public interest.
in writing. - Yet again we have an ideologically driven proposal, this time on postal services.
There has been no assessment of the social impact it will have, and no serious consultation with post office management, with employees or with consumers.
There is no demand, no logic and no justification for the liberalisation of postal services.
People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products.
They do not want to see their local post offices closed because the market offers insufficient profit for the private postal companies which will swamp the market, driving public operators like An Post to the wall.
People want a reliable postal service which will deliver their mail with the minimum of fuss and which will keep local post offices at the centre of the communities they serve.
How can people take seriously the idea the EU is promoting a social Europe when this proposal drives yet another nail in its coffin?
It is time to call a halt to the ideologically driven forced march towards liberalisation and privatisation.
People in Ireland have the opportunity to stop this by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty.
in writing. - (ET) I support the market being liberalised as quickly as possible and I welcome the directive which accomplishes the establishment of the internal market in postal services.
The closure of small post offices in Estonia has generated anger among people, but it is clear that with the implementation of new technologies such as the Internet the demand for a traditional postal service has fallen.
Where there is competition a new business in Internet-based services may arise, and this is to be welcomed.
I also understand the need for a known deadline in the Member States.
It is therefore important for the principle of reciprocity to apply when allowing Member States to refuse to open their market to postal service providers from neighbouring States whose providers are protected by law.
The important thing is for the universal postal service also to be guaranteed for everyone, including people in outlying areas and islands.
The postal service must be affordable, high-quality and accessible to all.
It is necessary to draw up plans for a cost-oriented universal postal service, since the concept is viewed differently in different Member States.
I believe that there are grounds for demanding that cost considerations of all services should be excluded from the universal postal service indicator.
in writing. - (DE) EU-wide liberalisation of postal services will happen - not in 2009, as originally planned, but in 2011.
In economic terms, the postal sector is very important, and it also impacts on other sectors of the economy.
As in all other areas of economic activity, more competition in the realm of postal deliveries makes sense.
Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries, for consumers will reap great benefits too.
This will not be the case, however, unless the basic conditions are right.
In other words, it must be guaranteed that letters will be delivered as efficiently as ever and at reasonable prices.
Care must be taken to ensure that the blanket provision of postal services is guaranteed in the long term - and guaranteed everywhere, including remote areas.
Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and, above all, job security for all those who work in the postal services.
It is also important that the same conditions should govern the operations of all postal-service providers.
It was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cut-throat liberalisation.
We must create a good and sustainable arrangement for everyone - the postal companies, their employees and, of course, their customers.
in writing. - (FI) Opening up postal services to free competition will inevitably mean a worsening of services, especially in sparsely populated countries like Finland.
The post office should be a public service, and we need to guarantee it has adequate funding by using the cash earned from services which are 'easy' to manage to assist in areas which are more 'difficult'.
A nation that wishes to preserve its unity and its sense of community will not privatise public postal services.
We also rely on a public service to safeguard protection of privacy and ensure the kind of security we demand of the post office.
Privatisation might result in an unsound staffing policy, which will damage confidence in the post office.
That is why our Group is voting against the position on privatisation adopted by the Council.
in writing. - The liberalisation of postal services is an important area of the European internal market.
Throughout the discussion we have had many concerns about universal postal services.
I think we can build on the experience of some European postal markets, which are already liberalised.
Postal services have been secured in these countries at the same time as quality and service has improved through more businesslike operations.
At the same time, travelling around in Europe I am faced with poor and slow service in many countries that are trying to get as many exceptions as possible from the liberalisation plans.
Furthermore, this report leaves much space for Member States to implement the liberalisation.
Many concerns that were brought up will thus remain concerns to be dealt with by national authorities.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his perseverance while dealing with this very tough process.
in writing. - (RO) The full liberalisation of postal services in Member States will have a positive impact not only on postal service users and consumers, who will benefit from new and innovative services and lower postal charges, but also on the economy of Member States as a whole.
The proposal for a Directive under discussion is complete in its current form, which allows for the extension of the deadline for full liberalisation of the postal service market in the case of certain Member States.
Romania is one of the beneficiaries of the new provisions adopted by the European Parliament.
The Romanian universal service provider is currently being restructured according to a schedule set by the Romanian Government for 2007-2010, and preparations for liberalisation will begin only afterwards.
This timeline benefits Romanian consumers, as the prospect of market liberalisation after 1 January 2013 means improved quality services at an affordable price.

Monitoring the application of Community law (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission's 23rd Annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2005) .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the application of Community law is a key part of the 'better lawmaking' agenda launched by the Barroso Commission.
For some time it has been a kind of Cinderella, lost amidst the fashion for impact assessments and cutting costs.
Today the Commission has started to rectify this, partly due to the pressure applied by Parliament.
This is a procedure that, for years, has in many cases just been a kind of bureaucratic grind, where one infringement follows another without much ado, but it remains an absolutely essential procedure.
The numbers speak very clearly.
To date, around 2 518 infringement procedures have been initiated in the most diverse sectors, particularly the environment and the internal market.
In addition to this there are the hundreds, thousands even, of petitions that the Parliament receives each year and that often refer to specific infringements of Community law, against which citizens feel helpless and therefore turn to Parliament.
The question is: what chance do they have of receiving satisfaction?
The infringement procedure is described by Articles 226 and 228 of the Treaty, and therefore there is not much scope for creativity.
The rules in force condemn us to slow, muddled procedures where the most effective measure - a fine - is rarely applied and only after a very long time, decades even.
However, a great deal, a very great deal, can be done and I thank the Commission for proposing in the last two years, and then last September in a specific communication, a series of measures that are analysed and evaluated in my report, and on which I would like to make a few comments.
First, however, allow me to make a point that I believe is crucial in this debate, because enforcing laws can be a very political matter and can be a wonderful tool for improving the credibility and visibility of the Community institutions.
I would like to mention two specific examples of somewhat different behaviour by the Commission: the waste crisis in Naples and the Via Baltica motorway in the Rospuda Valley in Poland.
The waste crisis in Naples was a direct consequence of infringements, occurring year after year, of practically all the Community rules on waste.
Indeed, very many infringement procedures had been initiated against Italy over the years and the Court had ruled against Italy on many occasions.
However, only now, years later, when the situation has become intolerable for everyone and impossible to hide, has the Commission decided to bang its fists on the table.
The Commission's visits are being followed with great interest, and citizens crying out against illegal tipping are announcing on television that petitions are being sent to the European Parliament.
I wonder: could this not have been done before?
Could we really not have taken a different attitude to prevent this situation arising?
Yes, we could!
This is actually what Commissioner Dimas did in the case of the Rospuda Valley in Poland, which was in danger of being spoiled by infrastructure for the Via Baltica.
For the first time, the Commissioner asked for a suspension order from the Court, and this was granted.
This is a very important precedent that sends an extremely clear message: the Commission can and must be firm and thorough with Member States that act as if nothing had happened, and it must use all the tools the democratic system allows: the media and public opinion.
One of the most important innovations that the Commission introduces in the communication concerns a 'new' working method.
We have expressed many doubts about this new working method, which mostly consists of sending complaints directly back to the Member State against which the complaint is being made, in order to try to solve the problem.
We expressed these doubts and the Commission gave us a few assurances that I hope we will also hear today, but we will be keeping a very close eye on the matter and truly hope that, on the issue of infringement procedures, transparency, the ability to 'name and shame' Member States and the joint work with Parliament, will bring progress.
Mr President, at the end of the debate, I will speak again for two minutes to finish my speaking time.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Council I would like to welcome your report on the Commission's annual report on monitoring the application of Community law, and the additional analysis envisaged in the Commission's communication 'A Europe of results - applying Community law'.
In our opinion the report by the European Parliament is a very useful contribution to our common aim of securing the timely and correct application of Community law.
On behalf of the Council I would like to welcome the findings of Mrs Frassoni's report, which in our opinion are essential, namely that securing the positive effects of Community law on the everyday lives of the citizens of the European Union depends primarily on the efficiency of European Union policies and on the supervision and monitoring of the methods by which the Member States comply with Community law.
We have a positive opinion of the European Parliament's commitment to supporting the exchange of best practice among the Member States.
In our view such exchanges would significantly contribute to a more efficient and unified application of Community law.
I must explain here that the Presidency of the Council cannot comment on most of the questions and proposals presented in this valuable report.
As we know, the administrative implementation of Community law is principally the responsibility of the Member States in accordance with their constitutional regulations, and of the Commission, which, as the guardian of treaties, is responsible for monitoring the uniform application of Community law.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is grateful for the opportunity to discuss these important issues with the European Parliament today, and I am very grateful for Mrs Frassoni's report and contribution, which contains valuable points.
I can assure you, Mrs Frassoni, that the Commission takes your points very seriously.
The European Union is a community under the rule of law and as such it is unique in the world.
Only the law can guarantee the freedoms that citizens are entitled to and only the law can shape the market economy in such a way that it works to the benefit of all.
The European Commission is the guardian of the treaties.
Its role is to ensure that Community law is being implemented everywhere and that it is correctly applied in each location.
Even the best law has no value as long as it exists only on paper.
Each committee will find, therefore, that one of its most important tasks is to ensure that our law does not consist merely of empty words.
In the treaty infringement proceedings and the European Court of Justice, we have a powerful weapon.
This weapon must be used when there is no other way to remedy violation of the law.
It is not an end in itself, however, and it could become blunt through excessive use.
The Commission does not believe that the number of treaty infringement proceedings is a measure of the seriousness and determination with which it monitors how well Community law is being observed.
Rather, the Commission believes that it is a matter of finding solutions to problems.
The real measure is how many problems relating to the application of Community law we have solved, and how quickly.
Indeed, we have critically reviewed the way we work and arrived at the following conclusions: once identified, problems must be dealt with quickly and efficiently.
Citizens and business people are entitled to speedy answers.
Therefore, Mrs Frassoni, I will go back to the Commission with what you said about rubbish in Campania and this topic will have to be discussed.
I fully agree that a rigorous, fast and determined approach is absolutely essential where Community law is being blatantly ignored.
In principle, an approach based on partnership is preferable to a confrontational one.
The Commission therefore wishes to see more dialogue and more transparency in these issues.
We also want to set clear priorities: deal with important matters first, and quickly, and do not use a sledgehammer to break a nut.
We must also make the necessary resources available.
Allow me to make one comment at this point.
If problems mount up in relation to the application of Community law to particular matters, that may be because the law itself is unclear or contradictory.
We should not assume from the outset that the Member States have a bad attitude.
As a consequence of these considerations, we took a series of steps and I would like to say from the outset that we will continue to have recourse to treaty infringement proceedings and institute them immediately when the necessary information is to hand.
However, we are suggesting a new way of working, with which we hope to obtain the necessary information more quickly.
This method is based on improving cooperation with the Member States before it gets to the stage of instituting official proceedings, except, of course - and this is very important, Mrs Frassoni - in the event that it is obvious from the start that, in all probability, a treaty is being infringed.
In such cases our first step is not to talk to the Member States, but to act.
It is not a totally new process, but a preliminary procedure in which we require additional procedures or in order to achieve a solution more quickly without instituting treaty infringement proceedings.
All enquiries and complaints are answered directly and speedily and, depending on the facts of the matter, can lead to treaty infringement proceedings.
That means that every submission is registered and processed.
If it is formulated as a complaint, or can be seen as a complaint, it is treated as a complaint and the Commission takes the appropriate steps.
We are currently testing this new method of working in a pilot phase.
Fifteen Member States are involved in the pilot project, which has been designed to ensure that we do in fact make progress.
Naturally, we will inform Parliament of the results of the pilot phase and discuss any further steps with Parliament.
All the same, we are already in a position to be able to find a solution to 90% of all problems that come to our attention without taking the matter to court.
However, we do share your opinion that this should be done more quickly.
A move to a monthly cycle of decision making, which commenced in January, should help.
This ensures faster, more efficient execution of treaty infringement proceedings.
Certainly, we are striving to make the whole process as transparent as possible while preserving the appropriate measure of confidentiality, as required of us by the European Court of Justice.
The public will have online access to regularly updated summaries of all treaty infringement proceedings currently before the court.
In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, we also need to know how the Member States are applying Community law in their respective national contexts.
Therefore, we need correlation tables - as called for in the report - that clearly show implementation status in each Member State.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we share the same goal.
We want Community law in which EU citizens can have complete confidence.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - Mr President, in the minute I have on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to do three things.
First of all, I would like to thank Ms Frassoni for her cooperation on this annual report, but, most of all, I would like to make clear the importance of the Petitions Committee in this monitoring and implementation procedure.
I think that importance has, at long last, been recognised by the Commission.
I thank the Commissioner for that, because we should really have a partnership in this exercise between our two institutions, and particularly involving the Petitions Committee, which is really our eyes and ears, as legislators, through our citizens, who come to us with direct problems that they perceive.
But, in order for our citizens to be able to do that, I come to my second point.
Commissioner, you talked about our law being living law.
Well, in order for it to be living law, it needs to be understandable - comprehensible - to our citizens.
I have had a long dialogue with your colleague Ms Wallström about citizens' summaries, so that citizens understand our law.
She has, on many occasions, promised us that these will be forthcoming with every legislative instrument.
We still await the real evidence of that happening.
Lastly, the Petitions Committee - and this I address to my own colleagues - needs much greater prominence and resources in our own House.
It is not just an interfering busybody committee.
It does a real job in connecting with our citizens in this area.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Commissioner, you are absolutely right: the rule of law is the foundation of the EU.
You correctly point out that Community legislation is the way to achieve the goals of the EU treaties, as its byword is the interest of European citizens, who have the right to demand the implementation of this law.
The bulk, breadth and complexity of legislation are constantly on the increase.
We MEPs from the European People's Party should like to express our satisfaction: through its 23rd annual report on monitoring the application of Community law and also through the announcement of the results in Europe, the Commission is demonstrating its desire to be the trustee of the treaties and to ensure that the legislation is implemented.
You are absolutely right in saying that we want the correlation tables, on which the Council made a decision today.
The rapporteur cooperated extensively with you to draw up Mrs Frassoni's report, on which we had an interesting hearing in Parliament.
Let us tell you that we also want Parliament to participate in the control procedure and wish to be kept informed about your activities.
We want you to come to our committees, as you do to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
We wish to hear your progress report.
We certainly want you to take into consideration the petitions we receive, as you point out in your report.
We should also like to stress that, as far as our decisions on immunities are concerned, we should like you to intervene to ensure that the national courts uphold them.
The implementation of Community law allows European citizens to hope that democracy, law and order will be strengthened, and that the EU authorities will become closer to them.
Today, after the resolution on the new reformed Lisbon Treaty, we all wish for a better future for the EU.
Mr President, one aim of Community legislation is the implementation of various EU political strategies.
The application of this legislation should be a priority for all Member States which, while simultaneously subject to control and monitoring by the Commission, will guarantee that it has the desired positive outcomes for the citizens of Europe.
In past years the total number of proceedings dealing with violations of legal regulations instigated by the Commission was steadily rising, to reach a level of almost 2 700 in 2005.
Despite EU enlargement by 10 new states, the years since then have not seen any overall rise in the number of violations.
There is a danger, however, that this situation may have arisen from a lack of registrations of complaints, or from administrative problems in the institutions responsible for considering violations.
The report should be praised first and foremost in respect of its inclusion of detailed studies of instances of violations linked to petitions, as well as the information provided on the readiness for broad cooperation by individual Directorates General on such matters.
We should also welcome the Commission's comprehensive communication 'A Europe of results - Applying Community law'.
However, the questions of funds available for consideration of instances of violation, the length of proceedings in cases of violation, the restricted application of Article 228 of the Treaty and evaluation of the application of priority criteria still need to be fleshed out in more detail by the Commission.
The proposed new working method being introduced in 2008, as a pilot project involving several Member States and, aimed at conducting existing proceedings more efficiently, deserves acknowledgement.
One stage of the procedure, however, namely the sending of a case to an interested Member State that is, above all, the party responsible for improper application of Community law, is a cause for concern: this may lead to a weakening of the role of warden of the treaties that rests with the Commission.
The creation of Community law should come to meet citizens' problems in such a way as to enable prompt answers to be found to their questions and complaints, which will make it easier for them to understand and make use of their rights, while at the same time effectively reducing the number of proceedings relating to violation of the law.
Finally, may I warmly congratulate Mrs Frassoni on a very well-prepared document.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to turn my attention to our three institutions and to emphasise how important it is that each one plays a part in the implementation and monitoring role.
Clearly, here, we are looking at the Commission's report.
Of course, the Commission has the prime responsibility for implementation and enforcement, and we would not wish to tread on its toes in that respect.
However, I think the Commission can assume that, in future, we will be watching much more carefully.
We are grateful that many of the lessons that were thrown up by our report on the demise of Equitable Life have been taken on board.
But, as we move into a new period, and perhaps try out some new ideas, we have to be very careful.
First of all, if we look at the Council, we still have to get agreed - and I was pleased to hear the Commissioner mention it - the idea of correlation tables in respect of each and every piece of legislation, so that everybody can see exactly what happens at Member State level and where each piece of law fits in.
The pilot project is an excellent idea.
That is all well and good, so let us see how it works out.
But - and here is the but - I am a little sceptical that so many Member States have signed up to it.
I hope they do not perceive it as some sort of soft option and I hope the Commission will disabuse them of the idea that could, in any way, be the case.
Lastly, I come to our own Parliament.
Clearly, post-Lisbon Treaty, we must have a much more important role in terms of monitoring.
We cannot assume that, once we finish with a piece of legislation here, that is the end of it.
Our committees will have to take on a much bigger role in checking.
One or two implementation reports are already happening - that will increase - and we will have to take on our responsibilities, along with the other institutions.
Just as a postscript - but a very important postscript - we also have to turn our attention to the education of our judiciary in our national courts to make sure that they, too, know how to implement Community law.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I congratulate my group colleague and group Co-President Mrs Frassoni for a timely and well thought-out report.
I also echo Mrs Wallis's comments and agree with them absolutely.
Passing laws keeps us in business, but enforcing laws actually delivers for our people, and a failure to enforce laws, frankly, makes us look like fools.
I congratulate the Commission on a number of steps that have been very positive.
But we really must bring this closer to the top of our agenda in this Parliament because, certainly in Scotland, there remains a strong perception that there is one law for one country and one law for another.
I am very aware that is not all the fault of the Commission, but we must all play our part in resolving that if we are one Europe.
So, in congratulating my group colleague, I am glad to hear that many of those points will be taken on board by the Commissioner.
I would like to make one more point, particularly in relation to environmental legislation, where many of the conflicts arise: many of the very worthy aims of individual pieces of legislation do conflict, and we must face up to that in preparing them.
There is scant guidance in terms of application for local authorities as to how they should deal with the often very worthy aims when they do conflict.
We were promised a review of that in the energy package, so if our Commissioner could give us some light on that process, which is ongoing, I would be very grateful.
(NL) Mr President, I, too, wish to compliment Mrs Frassoni on her report.
We have now had a number of reports on implementation, and a distinct common thread can be seen in those reports.
This means more attention to implementation, including on the part of the European Parliament.
We now have recourse to implementation reports.
In July I myself shall be presenting a report on the implementation of the eighth directive concerning the supervision of accountants.
It is good that Parliament is also taking a serious look at the transposition of legislation in Member States.
I should like to focus on the issue of supervisors in this regard.
We are talking about transposition by the authorities in the Member States and about the judges who apply the law.
However, many Member States also have independent supervisors who apply and elaborate legislation.
In practice, wide divergences have arisen among the various Member States and among supervisors.
Increasingly often, businesses operating internationally in several Member States are being faced with differing requirements from different supervisors from different Member States.
This is extremely inconvenient, and inhibits the operation of the internal market.
I should like to discuss one more point.
We cannot, in addition, avoid a further examination of the legislative instruments used in Europe.
Up to now, we have mainly been working with directives where harmonisation is concerned.
Commissioner Verheugen has already said on certain occasions that in future it may make sense to make more use of the regulation instrument for internal market legislation, in order to avoid all kinds of problems such as cherry-picking and gold-plating during the transposition of directives.
I know that in the national parliaments too, particularly the Dutch Parliament, the realisation is slowly but surely sinking in that implementation involving gold-plating and cherry-picking can be detrimental to the operation of the internal market and also to the domestic economy.
That being the case, the step towards a regulation, where possible, is no longer so very great.
(ES) Mr President, we are aware of the importance of your mission to monitor the application of Community law.
We are talking about relations between a supranational institution and national governments.
National governments are strong entities, with a great deal of power, they are public authorities.
Normally the Commission is the guardian of EU law and for citizens, in many cases, it is the only guarantee that they have that the law (because Community law is law) will be applied correctly.
The report by Mrs Frassoni is aimed at strengthening what I would call the backbone of the Commission, so that the Commission is aware of the importance of this task, and so that, even if we want a prior phase of negotiation with governments on the difficulties that may arise, at the moment of truth the Commission acts as the citizens expect, with strength and vigour, and applying Community law.
It is a concern that, following enlargement, we should have the impression that the Commission is applying less strict criteria to the new Member States than it applied to the old Members.
This would have a negative impact on the consolidation of the European Union and on the reputation of the European Union itself in those Member States.
Having followed many of the Commission's infringement proceedings, I can assure the Commission that, when it intervenes, citizens, and even the public authorities, feel strengthened by the action of the Commission in this area.
In other words, I think that the European Parliament report, the proposal put forward by Mrs Frassoni and also the opinion of Mrs Wallis are aimed at strengthening the Commission, so that the Commission does not consider itself to be alone and defenceless against the governments, but rather has the European Parliament to strengthen this role of overseeing and monitoring that the Commission has in relation to the application of Community law.
(DA) Mr President, the citizens of Europe are decisively important for the EU's legislation.
They are not simply sacrifices for the infringements, as in Naples for example.
In many environmental issues they have often been key players.
As guard dogs, they maintain a watch to ensure that the laws are implemented correctly in all corners of Europe, and in many cases they are the only ones to do this.
Because of this, the EU should also support citizens by securing them a strong position.
When they draw attention to infringements of Community legislation, their complaints should be handled seriously and with respect.
I sincerely hope that this is not an attempt on the part of the Commission to put a stop to many of these complaints, as this would be bad practice.
I would therefore like to thank Mrs Frassoni for drawing attention to these threats.
Her excellent report will now become an important general step in the right direction.
EU citizens will gain a stronger position through the Treaty of Lisbon, but if this is to be anything other than a pointless decoration, their contribution to the EU must be taken seriously.
(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Frassoni on an excellently prepared report.
I would also like to say how pleased I am that, according to the statistics presented by the European Commission concerning the number of proceedings relating to cases of violation of EU law, the accession of 10 new Member States has not had an impact on the number of violations recorded.
The statistics do not, however, tell the whole story.
One of the most important mechanisms enabling us to check how well the application of European law is really going is the system of pre-judicial references, the aim of which is to assign to national courts the potential to provide a uniform interpretation of the application of European law in all Member States.
The fundamental problem in this procedure is the time one has to wait for an answer from the Court, which is still very long (about 20 months).
The main reason - the time taken for translation - accounts for about nine months.
It is a matter of concern that in many national parliaments we hear voices demanding a cap on the budget specifically for written translations.
The European Commission's recommendations for Member States and candidate countries are based on the assumption that EU law will be effectively introduced when suitably qualified staff are employed and suitable funds are set aside.
I do not entirely support that view.
The number of staff and the amount of funds available is not the right yardstick.
Also needed are determination and involvement in the matter of introducing European law.
Proper execution of the tasks facing Member States and candidate countries requires three factors: knowledge, competence and readiness.
The first of these factors - that is, possession of knowledge - is not a problem today.
The second factor - the capacity to introduce the Community's achievements - is linked to the provision of suitable funds and the engagement of additional employees.
The Commission is currently placing the greatest emphasis on this particular aspect.
The third factor - the readiness of those whose task it is to introduce and apply European law - is the most underestimated.
Readiness to apply Community law in practice depends on the institutions and the system of procedures, incentives and restrictions.
Success or failure in the introduction of EU law will eventually be decided by the specific institutional model.
Knowledge and funds are not everything.
A good will to act is also needed.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, in your introduction you pointed out that the Commission does not want to launch out blindly but sound out whether something should be done, by discussing it with the Member States.
Now, within the Commission itself - which is, after all, a collegial institution - there is not always a clear, unified position on certain issues.
In the area of transport I currently see a topic that will become more and more problematic for us in the coming years - and probably within the Commission too - and that is the concept that money should be redirected to more environmentally friendly modes of transport by way of cross-subsidies from money that is earned in a less environmentally friendly area - road tolls, parking fees, etc.
That is, in effect, a subsidy.
Has there been any discussion about this, and how does the situation look?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
As has already mentioned by several speakers before me, success in achieving the objectives set out in the Treaties and legislative acts will depend on how effective the Member States are in applying Community law, and on how they transpose it into the national setting.
If they fail to apply the legislation or enforce it properly, or are unable to comply fully with the goals it contains, then we will have a problem.
In recent years the tendency has improved in terms of compliance with the legislation, and I think compliance by the ten new Member States is good.
I hope that this is not just because the Commission is more lenient towards us, towards the new Member States, but because we are putting genuine effort into fulfilling criteria and meeting expectations.
Unfortunately, navigating the bureaucratic jungle is still far from easy; we know how enormous the number of legislative measures is, and transposing these into national and regional law is often exceedingly time-consuming.
Enabling the simplification of bureaucratic language and more widespread use of impact assessments would be very important, as would ensuring that as little time as possible is taken up with conducting complaints procedures.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, the implementation of Community law by individual Member States is one of the basic principles of the European Union.
This is why monitoring and the elimination of deviations is the goal of numerous actions.
Checking of individual states and publication of the results of the checks would make it possible for citizens to play a part in the introduction of EU legislation in states.
Meanwhile, it continues to be the case that Poland, for example, still applies national imposition of value-added tax, VAT, despite the Sixth Directive and court rulings.
The same thing applies to double taxation on earned income.
There are known cases of duty being applied to vehicles purchased by Polish citizens in EU countries, despite rulings by the Court of Justice, and of delays in refunding wrongly calculated charges that have been paid.
One particular oddity is that our citizens are held on remand for years on end without any sentence having been passed.
The citizens of Poland are impatiently awaiting the European Commission's reaction to the examples provided and a curbing of the unlawful actions perpetrated by our government.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to Mrs Frassoni; it is just a pity that this report concerns a rather remote past, and it would have been nice if it had been about 2007.
(DA) Mr President, comitology is a study of how to limit democracy without the electorate realising.
Firstly, power is transferred from the electorate and the popularly elected representatives to government officials and lobbyists behind closed doors in Brussels.
Voting is then made subject to complicated rules that no-one can remember, no journalist can write about and no textbook author can explain.
The essence of this is simply that the non-elected in the Commission will decide, unless a qualified majority can be established against the Commission.
It is legislative power that is being turned into executive power; it is transparent legislation that is being turned into secret decrees; it is a majority democracy that is being turned into a minority government.
It is not an absolute autocracy, but it is heading in that direction with a hint of Mussolini's corporate ideas.
With the new interinstitutional agreement, Parliament can put a matter back on the agenda, but only if the right and left wings of the House are in agreement and can produce an absolute majority of members in favour.
Scrap the mixing of autocracy, however, and govern with shrewdness and corporatism!
Introduce democracy in all legislation!
As a fundamental principle, let us see that a majority of the popularly elected representatives are behind every law, either from national parliaments or here within the European Parliament!
Legislation by government officials and lobbyists should be a thing of the past, yet it is unfortunately being cemented into place in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is therefore another good reason to make the Treaty the subject of a referendum.
President-in-Office of the Council. - On behalf of the Presidency I would like to stress in a concluding comment that the Presidency is aware of the fact that efficient monitoring of the application of Community law is essential if the law is to be universally respected and if the general legal principles on which the running of the Community is based are to be safeguarded.
Primarily, however, it is important for ensuring legal certainty among European citizens.
It should not be forgotten that they have an important role in the implementation of Community law.
This role is also reflected in the number of complaints made by citizens about infringements of Community law.
During the debate, which I followed very closely, several people were astonished that the number of infringements, or at least perceived infringements, has not increased since the enlargement of the European Union.
Several speakers suspected that the Commission is not as strict with the so-called new Member States.
I must stress that the Presidency does not have any reason or evidence to support those doubts.
However, there is at least one possible explanation I can offer.
When it comes to the so-called new Member States, it must be taken into account that they became Members after many years of intensive transposition of Community law into their internal legal system, since when they have found it easier to continue the process on a smaller scale.
This is just by way of a comment on the suspicion that the Commission is not equally strict with all the Member States, but I think it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to comment on this matter.
To finish, I would like to stress that the Presidency attaches great importance to the common responsibilities and aims defined in the Inter-institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking.
Finally I would like to encourage all institutions and Member States to fulfil their obligations in the transposition and application of Community law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said that today's debate should not be without consequences, and I want to re-emphasise that. I will brief Mr Jung on the content of this debate and Parliament's input, and make suggestions too, as several very important suggestions have been made during this debate, which the Commission should take seriously.
Allow me to make another comment based on the philosophy of law: a community of nations under the rule of law is based on trust.
It can function only if those who participate can trust each other.
This is why, in a constitutional state, legal proceedings must take place in public and it is also the reason why I agree completely with what Mrs Wallis said.
Information is vital here, and transparency is imperative.
There can be no policy of secrecy in applying and interpreting the law.
Everything must be open and public.
That is what I take from this debate, anyway, and I have always been convinced of it.
I agree with what Mrs Wallis said about the role of the Committee on Petitions.
As her customer, in a manner of speaking, I freely admit that this sometimes requires a great deal of work and effort, but citizens are entitled to expect us to make this effort.
In addition, the petitions we receive teach us a great deal about how our citizens perceive our law and our policies.
Mrs Frassoni, Commissioner Wallström has already promised that, in future, we will create a citizens' summary.
Since then, the Commission has also passed a formal resolution on this, so it is going to happen, and I am quite sure you will find ways and means of making very sure that we do it.
It has been decided and it will happen.
Many Members have pondered the question of the new Member States and how it can be that, despite growth in the number of Members, there has been no growth in lawsuits for infringement of treaties.
The Commission has a very clear opinion on this, and that is that there are two reasons: firstly - and here I feel rather self-conscious, for I really ought to say that this is due to the good work of the previous Enlargement Commissioner - it has to do with the fact that the new Member States prepared so exactingly for their acquis that, at the time they joined, they met the requirements more precisely than the old Member States.
I can only confirm this.
It is the absolute truth.
We would never have been able to conclude the accession treaties if the acquis had not been fulfilled.
The other reason is perhaps somewhat more practical, however: citizens of the new Member States need to learn, gradually, that they can complain, and how to do so.
I therefore assume that the number of complaints will increase.
Mr Smith mentioned that the law must also be straightforward and applicable, particularly in regard to environmental legislation.
As we know, the Commission is working on reviewing all Community law by the end of next year in order to ascertain where and how it can be simplified.
Just a few days ago, as part of our presentation of progress on this 'Better Regulation' project, we promised that this whole process would indeed be completed by the end of next year.
Mr Medina, you do not need to worry that the Commission is sweeping complaints under the carpet.
From my own experience of more than eight years as a member of the Commission, I can assure you that I have had to put the brakes on overzealous Commission departments far more often than I have needed to urge them to fire up the heavy artillery of the treaty infringement process.
Far more frequently, I have to say to them: 'Hang on, just slow down, talk to them first and see if this can be resolved peaceably'.
The risk of Commission departments tending to brush things under the carpet is almost nonexistent.
I am certain that it does not happen.
As far as Mr Rack's question is concerned: decisions on treaty infringements, be it the lead-up or the conclusion or any individual step in between, require a formal decision by the College of Commissioners.
That is how it is organised.
I am unable here and now to answer your question about the specific problem of cross-subsidies, but I will make sure that you receive an answer before the end of this week.
Regarding Mr Kuc's remarks on the length of detention while awaiting trial, I admit that this would be a scandal if it occurred, but it is outside the jurisdiction of the European Union.
The European Court of Human Rights is the competent court for such cases.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all your suggestions and the constructive spirit of this debate.
I am fairly sure that we will have made further progress when we discuss it again next year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members, the Commissioner and the Presidency for their participation in this discussion which, as Commissioner Verheugen said, does not end here.
Just a few points quickly.
I would like to comment on the issue of defining priorities, which Commissioner Verheugen spoke about.
I believe this could actually be a risky exercise. However, it has never really been done until now.
I have always been rather sceptical about the possibility of really defining priorities.
Anyway, if you really want to go along this route, take the risk of being transparent, and why not even debate these priorities?
Otherwise the suspicion could take root that the priorities have been chosen because you want to get rid of the inconvenient infringements.
I do not think this would be a good thing.
The second comment is that despite the fact that the Commission denies that it needs more resources, particularly human resources, to deal with infringements, the reality is that in almost all the meetings I have had with your fellow Commissioners, everyone has told me that they do not have sufficient resources, sufficient people, to deal with this matter.
In the debate the question came up of the number of infringements in the new Member States, and what the Commissioner and the Presidency said is probably true.
However, we should also know that, for example, on environmental matters, there are only two or perhaps three officials dealing with all ten of the new Member States, so obviously there is certainly a human resources problem.
Lastly, the issue of Parliament's role.
We are discussing internally various ways of making our role as co-legislators more effective, by following up the application of the directives we approve.
I believe there are two things we absolutely must do: the first is decisively, through a political decision, to strengthen the role of the Committee on Petitions, which as Mrs Wallis said, is our window on the world; the second is that we should systematically organise application sessions, which do, however, require the open cooperation of the Commission.
Because if we organise sessions where we discuss the application of directives and the Commission official who attends remains silent or tells us things that are of little interest - perhaps because he cannot say what we really want to know - then the whole exercise becomes pointless.
Anyway, thank you and we will undoubtedly speak about this again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Amending budget No 1/2008 - Solidarity Fund - Mobilisation of the European Union's Solidarity Fund (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Kyösti Virrankoski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on Draft amending budget No 1/2008 of the European Union for the financial year 2008, Section III - Commission, and
the report by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in application of point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management - C6-0036/2008 -.
rapporteur. - (FI) Madam President, the European Solidarity Fund was created in 2002 in the wake of the disastrous floods which struck in central Europe, affecting both EU Member States and candidate countries.
At the time it was agreed the fund should be EUR 1 billion a year.
This fund was meant to bring relief to those who had suffered damage due to major catastrophes.
The extent of catastrophic damage must be at least EUR 3 billion or no less than 0.6% of the Member State's GNP.
If the damage is restricted to a small area, it could be less, but regionally it could be relatively more.
The damage now under discussion was the result of the large-scale flooding in the United Kingdom in June and July 2007.
The damage is put at EUR 4.6 billion, so it is eligible for compensation.
The Commission is proposing EUR 162 million.
In its budget, the Committee on Budgets is recommending support for providing finance in the manner the Commission is suggesting.
However, it requires Parliament to approve mobilisation of that support.
For that reason, Mr Böge's report on the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund needs to be adopted first.
In other respects, the first amending budget mainly concerns agencies and the administrative management of the Galileo Programme.
In the budget a European Research Council Executive Agency was set up.
Its creation accords with the budgetary procedure agreed for this year.
Under the amending budget a joint executive agency, the Research Executive Agency (REA), is created, for the other programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme for research too.
This is also in line with the earlier budgetary procedure.
Similarly, the amendments to the staffing timetable for the border control agency, Frontex, which Parliament had called for have been made.
Parliament increased the funds for this agency by EUR 30 million in the budgetary procedure, and these now constitute the necessary additional funds.
The toughest problem relates to the Galileo satellite navigation programme.
Parliament's great achievement was that it succeeded in the budget negotiations in guaranteeing the programme's funding by increasing the amount set aside for it by EUR 2.4 billion for six years.
This partly came about through an adjustment to the muiltiannual financial framework.
The project thus clearly became an EU project.
Now it is a matter of administering the project.
The Commission is proposing EUR 2 million in the form of a transfer from operating appropriations to administration.
The project's administration, however, is in a mess.
It has mainly been managed in the EU by GSA, the Galileo Supervisory Authority.
It task has been mainly concerned with permits and partnership discussions between the public and private sectors.
The private sector having been excluded in the initial phase, the GSA's role is unclear, as is that of the Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).
It was at first thought that the ESA would be responsible for implementing the project's technical side, which the EU would oversee and fit out.
The division of labour between the various actors, such as the Commission and the separate agencies, is, however, unclear.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is therefore proposing in Mrs Barsi-Pataky's report that the GSA should be abolished.
Given these circumstances, the Committee on Budgets could not agree to the transfer of the appropriation to the Commission, but instead simply proposes the creation of a PM line.
The Commission promised that it would effect the transfer within the scope of its competence before Galileo's entire administration system had been agreed.
Changing the amending budget in this respect would therefore not delay the project, but it would ensure Parliament's negotiating position.
I hope that the plenary will be able to go along with the Committee's unanimous position as regards the first amending budget.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur on the 2008 budget, Kyösti Virrankoski, has really covered all the essential points.
So we are speaking today on the basis of a proposal from the Commission about the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in application of point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
While it is true that the Solidarity Fund and other special instruments do not represent large sums of money in relation to the general budget of the European Union, they ultimately serve to help stricken regions and their people in the event of natural disasters, and, as we all know, these disasters - be they storms or raging fires - have become a somewhat regular occurrence.
Before we took our decision, we in the Committee on Budgets made a point of holding a hearing, to which we invited representatives of the affected regions of the United Kingdom, of local organisations and also of the national administration.
At that hearing we were reminded very clearly of the challenges facing the stricken people and regions and of the extent of the damage caused by the flooding in June and July 2007, estimated at a total of EUR 4.6 billion.
On the basis of this hearing and our talks, we fully endorsed the Commission's proposal that EUR 162 387 000 be made available from the Solidarity Fund for this special case.
Let me also make a point of mentioning that we can expect further mobilisations of the Solidarity Fund in the coming months.
In such cases, to be sure, it is not only the European Community that is called on to show solidarity: in view of the increased incidence of such disasters, the Member States should be giving more thought to preventive crisis management, in other words assessing the state of their civil-defence systems, checking how local fire brigades are equipped and examining how they can perhaps develop different strategies in future on issues such as building work in flood-prone areas.
These things are an integral part of any long-term strategy if we want to maintain our credibility.
Another requirement - and we are somewhat better placed in this respect on the present occasion than in other cases - is that we should all make it our common aim, as a matter of basic principle, to ensure that the processing of future claims on the Solidarity Fund is completed in a maximum of six months.
That is a challenge to everyone: the national authorities must submit all the requisite applications and documents within the prescribed period, the Commission must deal with the case in hand on the basis of the applicable provisions, and we in Parliament must also expedite matters by means of prompt deliberation.
Allow me to refer to one final point, which relates to the amending budget.
In view of the difficult negotiations and of the pending completion of the legislative procedure on the Galileo satellite navigation system, I strongly endorse the stipulation made by the rapporteur that the budget line created for expenditure on administrative management should be a pro memoria item.
That is a step in the right direction if the appropriate administrative structures are to be established within the Commission.
We are not yet satisfied, however, with the arrangements for future interaction between the Commission, the European Space Agency and the Galileo Supervisory Authority.
In the course of the legislative procedure, there is a need at least to indicate a way of avoiding duplication of effort and developing the appropriate management structures in the new circumstances of the Galileo satnav system.
There is still a certain need for discussion, which I hope we can satisfy as soon as possible.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on 18 January the Commission adopted the proposal for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the United Kingdom, and we are happy and satisfied that the Committee on Budgets' opinion is quite positive towards our proposal.
Along with amending Budget No 1/2008, we also proposed the allocation of EUR 162 million from the solidarity fund for the UK in order to compensate for the serious damage caused by last summer's floods.
As the chairman of Committee on Budgets has already said, we have recently received requests from two Member States - Greece and Slovenia - and we will probably be presenting a new proposal very soon.
Of course, this proposal is not only about the solidarity fund.
It is only the solidarity fund that will have financial implications: other elements of the proposal are more technical.
The Galileo question, of course, is very sensitive to all of us and I fully understand the concerns of the Committee on Budgets.
However, I must say that the proposal of the Committee on Budgets to change the Commission proposal will delay delivery of the solidarity fund by about one month because it will have to go back to Council for another vote, but we understand the sensitivity and we cannot argue with the decision of the Committee on Budgets on this matter.
However, I very much hope that our proposal in general will be supported this week in Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to say that I support this amending budget, and there are one or two items which I would like to comment upon.
Firstly concerning the Solidarity Fund: this, of course, was the allocation in respect of the floods in Britain in June and July last year.
Much of this flooding happened in my region, and I can testify to the appalling damage and hardship which it brought on many residents of my area.
I was interested - but not surprised - to note that this was the third largest claim in the history of the solidarity fund, the claim being EUR 4.6 billion and the allocation being to the sum of EUR 162.8 million.
I am aware that my friend and colleague Reimer Böge said that, of course, in the grand order of things it is not a great deal of money.
Perhaps it is not, but as a gesture of solidarity, please believe me that it is well and truly appreciated, and on behalf of the people of that region, I want to express my thanks: firstly to the members of the Budget Committee, who were unanimous in their support of this aid package - which is truly a gesture of solidarity.
But may I also express my appreciation to the Commissioner and her colleagues who turned this claim around in seven months.
I thought that was a remarkable achievement, Commissioner, and I thank you for your efforts to do that.
I shall, of course, watch with interest over the next weeks and months to see how the United Kingdom Government disburses those funds, but it is clear to me that, with the increasing evidence of extreme climatic events, these issues are going to occur with a greater regularity throughout the European Union, and it is clear that, when expressing solidarity, it is in fact speed of response that is the most important element in that mechanism.
On the issue of Frontex, I also wanted to say that I support the additional funding for Frontex - we doubled the funding for the Agency.
I thought that was exactly right, and I note that this request is for the creation of 25 posts.
But I do believe that it is important that we continue to monitor the distribution of funding, to ensure that it delivers value for money.
In the same way, I supported thoroughly the Lisbon objectives which the Commission set for themselves, particularly in the field of research and development.
I therefore recognise the need for the research executive agencies; but again, I express my anxiety at the proliferation of agencies which, I have to say, historically have not been renowned for their effective delivery of value for money.
Finally, on the subject of Galileo: this new budget line will do a great deal to give greater transparency and accountability.
However, I do agree with my colleagues on the Budget Committee when we say that we will proceed with caution.
If I may say so, Madam Commissioner, this is a massive undertaking, and - borrowing some space age jargon - may I say that the Commission here is 'boldly going where no Commission has ever gone before'.
I therefore agree with my colleague Reimer Böge when he says that we support this, but we would insist on inserting the PM line.
Mr President, I support the amending budget and am happy to do so.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am replacing Mr Titley, the leader of the Labour MEPs, tonight, but I can speak on behalf of all those MEPs in welcoming this amending budget and the decision to grant EUR 162 million to the UK regions affected by flooding.
As Mr Ashworth has said, it is a small grant towards covering the huge costs of the damage done by the floods in the UK, but we are appreciative to our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, who voted unanimously, and also to the Commission.
I understand it was the quickest payment ever made: within seven months.
Therefore, although many people have been suffering for a long time, it is progress compared with previous funds.
We also understand that it is one of the largest payments ever made, and we are appreciative of that.
Last year's floods affected 48 000 UK homes and 700 businesses and the total damage is estimated at over EUR 4 billion.
My own region of Yorkshire was one of the worst affected and many people have still not returned to their homes and, therefore, this help and assistance is very much appreciated.
I am replacing Mr Titley as he is stuck in London because of the very severe storms that are battering western Europe this evening.
We cannot attribute all bad weather to climate change, but we do know that the number of extreme weather events is increasing.
We have seen severe floods, and also the fires in Greece and southern Europe last summer, and no amount of solidarity funds can actually meet the damage and the cost which we are seeing as a result of these climate-change events.
We are beginning our work as MEPs on the new package of climate change legislation.
I very much hope this House will adopt a tough stance and implement and agree good legislation which really does tackle climate change so that we do not have to come back here and ask the Commission for money to tackle these kinds of events.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in a sense I have an easy task following the last two speakers.
I, too, wish to speak clearly in favour of the proposal from our rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Böge, but particularly in favour of the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the UK.
A sum of EUR 162 million: it seems to be uncontentious, but it is hugely important on several levels.
As an MEP, I represent the area of Yorkshire and the Humber, hit, as Ms McAvan said, by floods last summer - cities, villages across our region devastated.
Many individuals, even in the village down the road from me, are still out of their homes.
Whilst we know that this payment may not change their situation overnight, it will go indirectly towards helping by relieving pressure on our Government's own budget.
Secondly, I am extremely pleased that our Government made this application, and a successful application at that.
There were times at the beginning when we were not sure that would happen, and I hope that, having gone through this experience, our government will now become a big fan of the solidarity fund in Council and will persuade other Member States accordingly.
Lastly, the British people, my constituents, will now understand that European solidarity has a tangible and practical meaning.
And that will apply, I think, to all of us in this House.
As climate change does bite, we may all be in the situation of representing those who are victims of such natural disasters and may have, therefore, to lay claim to European solidarity.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, solidarity is the European Union's most important and finest principle.
Without it there can be no question of joint action by independent states and nations.
The creation of the European Union Solidarity Fund followed naturally from this principle.
For the time being we have EUR 1 billion available annually.
That is not a large sum, especially as last year, and this year too, we have had to face an increase in climatic disasters.
We have been hit not only by floods and hurricanes, but by fires of unexpected magnitude.
With our limited means we are able so far to make only a small amount of help available - 3% or 4% of the losses incurred, or even less.
That is why, while supporting Mr Böge's report and Mr Virrankoski's draft amending budget, I also conclude that the resources of the Solidarity Fund need to be gradually increased.
Two euros per citizen will not suffice to wipe away the tears when such enormous losses are incurred.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year's floods.
We are all very happy that the EU has generously come to the aid of a Member State in difficulty.
But it is not quite like that: first, the grant is only 3.5% of the cost of the damage - a gesture, as Mr Ashworth says - and, secondly, it is nine months after the event - and that is fast, they say!
It would have been more helpful if we had known it would be forthcoming, and then reconstruction could have been planned accordingly.
If there is one thing that gets up the nose of the British - when we realise that we are getting back a little of the cash we have paid into the European Union - is that we are obliged to beg for it and then advertise the EU's generosity.
Please, can we not rather keep our own money and then decide how to spend it ourselves?
That way, it could be paid out more quickly.
(FR) Mr President, most of our States have lines of credit in their budgetary law for dealing with disasters.
Under French budgetary law, for example, there are global allocations that allow appropriations to be committed by decree in advance in emergencies.
Since November 2002, European budgetary law has incorporated this disaster financing law with this Solidarity Fund.
For financial disasters, we have also set up the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
As regards natural disasters, we are being asked for aid of less than 4% to repair the flood damage in the United Kingdom in June 2007, costing over 4 billion.
Nine months to commit appropriations is a long time, because this is by definition an emergency situation.
That means that the amending budget method to authorise the commitment is not operational.
The amending budget should come into effect earlier to ratify the commitment to be made in advance, with provisional and non-restrictive appropriations for disasters, floods and fires.
That being so, EUR 162 million in solidarity for the United Kingdom of Adam Smith, Ricardo and Mrs Thatcher, who only believe in the market, Darwinism and natural selection, is an excellent lesson in pragmatism.
When the lion that roars in the economic jungle gets wet, he discovers the virtues of solidarity.
That is three times now - mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and floods - and tomorrow our British Members will also have the chance to show solidarity with the European farmers who have got wet from imports.
- (EL) Mr President, this amending budget proves once again what is self-evident: that the EU has the mechanisms and adaptability to provide solutions to specific unexpected problems.
I should like to make three proposals for the package of two reports that we have discussed today.
Two of them concern the Solidarity Fund, and the third, the Galileo Programme.
On the issue of the floods in the UK, the time interval between July and the present response from the EU is very satisfactory.
It happens to be the quickest response throughout the operation of this fund, at least as far as I can remember.
However, it creates a precedent: in future we shall expect such an immediate response to similar disasters, and here I am referring to the environmental catastrophe that we suffered in Greece last summer only a month later, in August.
I therefore hope that next month the Commission will at last make a proposal through the competent Commissioner addressing the Greek request to activate the Solidarity Fund.
I do not need to remind you of the shocking images of the great fire disaster in Greece; we all saw them, throughout Europe.
I hope that, mutatis mutandis, we shall at last have the Commission's proposal in our hands within the coming month.
My second comment concerns the spectacle we are now making of ourselves.
I have no idea how Parliament manages it, but every time we have some good news, we are the only ones who know about it!
We are on our own, with no-one in the galleries, and probably not a single journalist!
When shall we finally learn to market good news properly?
My third and last comment concerns the Galileo Programme.
I agree with all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and, as that committee's rapporteur for the Galileo Programme, I wish to be quite clear that we are not going to make any payment from the very considerable package of funds we have committed, unless we agree with the Council on the wider architecture of the programme.
If we do not know who is doing what - and we are still in the dark because we are negotiating with the Council - we shall not spend anything.
We are not going to throw money down the drain.
Tomorrow morning we have a very important trilateral discussion with the Slovenian Presidency.
There are two major outstanding issues.
I hope that we can conclude these negotiations so that we can set our minds on making genuine progress.
- (LT) The EU Solidarity Fund is a very important aid to Member States and qualifying candidate countries in the event of natural disasters.
However, in the light of experience, the need to reform the Solidarity Fund, adapt it to meet new challenges and increase its efficiency is obvious.
First of all, the minimum damage threshold of EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of GDP is too high, excluding any aid to countries suffering from disasters on a lower scale, which could nonetheless have serious consequences for the countries concerned.
Secondly, the fund cannot be disbursed to relieve the consequences of terrorism, public health crises and technological or industrial accidents.
Thirdly, a few problems arise with regard to funds that are disbursable in the event of exclusively regional accidents, the criteria for the use of which have not been defined clearly enough.
In conclusion, I welcome the reform of the fund and urge the Council to outline its position on this without delay.
(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the following points in this debate.
First, it is regrettable that the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund has still not been adopted by Council, despite the fact that the European Parliament took a position on the matter at the first reading almost two years ago, in May 2006.
Second, the mobilisation of EUR 162 million to help make good the damage caused by the floods of June and July 2007 in Britain and Ireland, the total cost of which amounted to almost EUR 5 billion, deserves our support.
A pity that funds for that purpose are being allocated many months after the damage was incurred, which can make the aid less effective.
As the Polish proverb says: 'He who gives quickly gives twice.'
Third, since the ceiling for the Solidarity Fund has been set at EUR 1 billion, I would hope that, in the event of damage on such a scale as in Britain, appropriate funding will be mobilised speedily and that the needs of both old and new Member States will be addressed on equal terms.
- (EL) Mr President, as well as thank the rapporteur for the very good work he has done, I wish very briefly to raise just one point concerning the Solidarity Fund.
Mr President, every year we have bad weather in the EU.
It is also ironic that, just when we are discussing these important reports, Northern Europe should be hit by violent storms.
Thank goodness that the EU provides financial support in the event of such disasters, as is now the case in the UK, and as it has done in the past for Cyprus.
However, we must not forget that in addition to the financial aspect, there has to be a Europe-wide organisational unit capable of providing immediate relief to the stricken areas.
- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity is a fine word, and an even finer concept.
Unfortunately, there is a very great need for it: the facts show that this need is becoming increasingly pressing because of natural disasters, which we should no longer look on as natural, but rather as increasingly frequent occurrences in our lives.
In the summer months of 2007 alone, three very serious events occurred.
Firstly, there was the UK situation that we are discussing and voting on today; immediately afterwards there were the terrible fires in Greece, which you all know about, and not long after that, more floods in Slovenia.
All this shows us how serious these phenomena are, and also how essential it is for the EU to take action.
I am surprised when fellow Members say they do not understand why the EU should provide money.
It is a matter not only of money, but also of moral support and the feeling among the inhabitants of those areas that the EU is aware of their tragedy.
In many cases it is a tragedy, and the EU is doing something about it.
This leads me to point out, as has been said before, that the example of the UK, which we applaud, for it elicited a relatively rapid response, should be emulated in the countries that are subsequently stricken.
It is no accident that our country, Greece, is next on the list for assistance from the Solidarity Fund, and we hope that in our case, too, help will be rapidly forthcoming.
However, I am not sure that this will happen, and I wonder whether this is due to the EU and to how it deals with requests, or to the way in which the request itself was submitted by Greece.
No matter: we hope that help will soon be given to Greece too, because I assure you that the situation in Greece is still very serious.
The problem is that the money for Greece, which was put into the Fund, has not yet been announced.
(PL) Mr President, the functioning of the EU Solidarity Fund is seen in a very positive light by the Member States, and particularly by EU citizens.
The Fund establishes the possibility of granting aid to those affected by natural disasters that cause considerable damage.
Its purpose is to help make good the losses incurred, which weigh heavily on the budgets of many families.
Such financial aid from EU funds is an example of European solidarity.
For the European families that suffer, our EU citizens, it is the best example of the advantages and benefits of membership of the European Community when such a need arises.
However, we must concentrate our action - and find the necessary funding in the EU budget - on combating the causes of such disasters and on establishing appropriate crisis management arrangements and an appropriate insurance system.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to thank all those who have taken part in the debate for their excellent, constructive input.
The Solidarity Fund is very young and so its limits have been set very high.
It has not been possible to rely on previous information concerning how much money is needed.
Perhaps the limits can be reviewed to some extent in the future.
I agree that speed is undoubtedly an advantage in this work.
The Committee on Budgets has given much thought to the use of the Globalisation Fund to overcome the problems resulting from lost jobs.
This is obviously an area where the EU in the future will have a lot of work to do.
In the same way, many have remarked on the issue of crisis management.
This year's budget also incorporates a pilot project to speed up the prevention of forest fires, and in that area we are aiming at new and good results.
As regards the Galileo project, there is not to be any increase in its funding.
This obviously has to be regarded as a basic principle.
The current level of funding is sufficient.
Its administration, however, needs to be efficient.
Especially now, when the levels of funding are considerable, there is a great danger that its administrative management will also become more bureaucratic.
It must be efficient, and for this reason we want to maintain Parliament's scope for negotiation, so that we and the Commission and the Council can together agree on what the best possible form of governance is to see this European and very ambitious, major project through to the end.
I am convinced that over the weeks to come we will achieve a satisfactory result.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) I believe that the request formulated by Great Britain is pertinent and I support the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in this case.
Romania was confronted with major floods over the last years; the latest floods occurred recently.
As in the case of Great Britain, much of the damage caused by floods could have been avoided by greater involvement in the prevention effort.
The existing infrastructure, as well as the response of the national authorities was nevertheless overwhelmed by the force of the natural phenomenon.
Consequently, I support two measures which the European Union can take to enhance national and European feedback: allotment of money from the structural funds for infrastructure works designed to mitigate the effects of natural catastrophes; secondly, the establishment -as soon as possible- of the European Intervention Force, consisting of specialist teams from all the Member States to intervene in emergency situations in any region of the European Union.
Another important aspect is the level of the funds allotted by the European Union in emergency cases.
Given that we envisage an extensive review of the European Union budget, I believe that we should consider an increase of the amounts allotted to the European Solidarity Fund.
Formal sitting - Celebration of the European Parliament's fiftieth anniversary
(Short performance by the European Union Youth Orchestra, conducted by Pavel Kotla)
That was a beautiful rendition by the European Union Youth Orchestra with Pavel Kotla conducting.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all very warmly here to the Chamber to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the constituent session of the European Parliamentary Assembly.
First and foremost, may I suggest that together, we welcome by acclamation all the former Presidents who are with us here today: Emilio Colombo, Lord Henry Plumb, Enrique Barón Crespo, Egon Klepsch, Klaus Hänsch, José Maria Gil Robles, Nicole Fontaine and Josep Borrell Fontelles.
Welcome to all of you, esteemed former Presidents of the European Parliament.
(Sustained applause)
May I also extend a very warm welcome to Janez Janša, the President-in-Office of the European Council, and José Manuel Durão Barroso, the President of the European Commission.
Of course, Mr Barroso, you are a familiar face here in the Chamber, but you are especially welcome today.
(Applause)
It is a particular pleasure to welcome Lluís Maria de Puig, President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, here to the Chamber of the European Parliament.
A warm welcome to you.
(Applause)
It is a pleasure to welcome the Presidents and Speakers of the Parliaments of Belgium, Herman van Rompuy, of Italy, Fausto Bertinotti, and of the Dutch Senate, Yvonne Timmerman-Buck, who together with other representatives of the Parliaments of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Kingdom have joined us here in the European Parliament today and whom I would also like to welcome.
(Applause)
I welcome the Presidents of the other European institutions: for the European Court of Justice, Peter Jann, the President of the First Chamber; for the European Court of Auditors, its President Vítor Caldeira; for the European Economic and Social Committee, President Dimitris Dimitriadis; for the Committee of the Regions, Luc Van den Brande; and the Ombudsman, Nikoforos Diamandouros.
Welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
It is a pleasure to welcome the local and regional representatives: the Mayor of Strasbourg, Fabienne Keller, the President of the Regional Council of Alsace, Adrien Zeller, the President of the Conseil Général du Bas-Rhin, Philippe Richert, and the Prefect of the Region of Alsace and Bas-Rhin, Jean-Marc Rebière.
Welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, seat 146 is occupied by our colleague Astrid Lulling, who is the only one of us to have been a Member of the European Parliament in the days before it was directly elected.
(Sustained applause)
Almost exactly 50 years ago, on 19 March 1958, the Common Assembly of the three European institutions - the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Coal and Steel Community - convened for the first time here in Strasbourg in what was then the 'Maison de l'Europe'.
The Assembly consisted 'of representatives of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community', as stated in the Treaty of Rome, which had entered into force a few weeks earlier.
Today, we are celebrating this anniversary because we are the direct successors to that Parliamentary Assembly, and its original 142 Members, in a line of continuity.
The first President of this Common Assembly was the great Robert Schuman.
In his inaugural address, he said that the Assembly would play a key role in developing the European spirit, 'for which', he said, 'the Assembly was and remains the crucible'.
I believe that this is as true now as it was then.
At the same time, Robert Schuman warned his colleagues, at that constituent session, that parliamentary work with 142 Members - from six countries at that time - would require discipline from everyone and of course this is even more relevant today, with 785 Members from 27 countries, as we all know!
Not long after the constituent session, our predecessors began to call their institution the 'European Parliament', albeit informally at first, for the term did not appear in the European Communities' founding Treaties.
It was not until four years later, in March 1962, that the Parliamentary Assembly took a decision to style itself the 'European Parliament'.
Although the founding Treaties of the European Communities stated that the Assembly 'shall draw up proposals for elections by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all Member States' and that 'the Council shall, acting unanimously ... lay down the appropriate provisions, which it shall recommend to Member States for adoption in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements', it was not until 1976 that the Council - on the basis of the European Parliament's recommendation of 20 September 1976 - adopted a legislative act for the conducting of direct and universal elections to the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Parliamentary Assembly initially had virtually no powers of its own.
Our predecessors know that developing the European parliamentary dimension would be a long process and that this would require a clear compass, commitment, patience and stamina from them and subsequent generations.
Step by step, the European Parliament secured more and more powers of its own, becoming ever more conscious of its responsibilities and scope for action, and I believe I can say on behalf of everyone here that today it is genuinely worthy of its name.
(Applause)
Today we are the representatives of almost 500 million Union citizens and we reflect all the different strands of the political spectrum in the European Union.
We are the freely elected Parliament of the European Union, united in our efforts to achieve the best and most convincing solutions.
We have become self-assured and a major player in European politics.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reason to derive great satisfaction from that.
This process began in 1958 and there have been milestones along the way, on our shared path towards European integration.
In 1971 the European Community was given its own budget, and since then the European Parliament has played a key role in the adoption of successive budgets.
In 1979 the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.
In 1986, with the Single European Act, the name 'European Parliament' finally took legal effect.
With the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty 15 years ago, the European Parliament was finally granted full codecision powers in initial areas of Community policy, enabling it to make a real contribution to the framing of legislation, and apply the brakes, if necessary, against the will of the Council.
The Amsterdam Treaty further enhanced these codecision rights, while the Lisbon Treaty will establish codecision as the rule in the crafting of European legislation, and therefore refers, appropriately, to the 'ordinary legislative procedure'.
Today, we are 785 Members from 27 European nations.
We represent more than 150 national political parties, most of which have joined together to form the seven parliamentary groups.
We are both a legislative and a budgetary authority, on an equal footing with the Council.
We exercise oversight over the European Commission and elect its President, and the Commission cannot take office without our approval.
We are an advocate for the primacy of Community law, and we are the citizens' chamber of the European Union.
Three weeks ago we adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, which will further strengthen our powers.
In future, decisions on important issues of current concern to citizens in the European Union can be taken only if a majority in the European Parliament gives its consent.
This also applies to key issues of justice and home affairs.
However, this is no reason to be complacent and it is certainly not the outcome of an inevitable process.
We had to fight every inch of the way.
I would like to thank everyone who, over the past five decades and in the capable hands of our Presidents, has worked to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of European integration and rendered a valuable service to that process.
Thank you to the Members of the European Parliament, past and present!
(Applause)
Jean Monnet once said: 'Nothing is possible without people, and nothing is permanent without institutions'.
I would also like to take a moment to remember Paul-Henri Spaak, the first President of the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) - the institution that preceded the European Parliament - who, with his report after the Messina Conference in June 1955, made a major contribution to the preparation of the Treaty of Rome.
The path towards parliamentary democracy in the European Union has followed a logic that is familiar to us from the history of the European nation states.
What we have created is an institutional balance between the national and the European level, which is a major success and reflects the interaction between the various levels of shared governance in Europe.
An important element of this balance is the European Parliament's good cooperation with the national parliaments, which is of special concern to us.
I am very happy to see that almost all the national parliaments of the Member States of the European Union have sent high-level representatives to be with us today.
(Applause)
I would ask all of you - the Members of the European Parliament and the members of the national parliaments - to play your part in the endeavour to maintain that cooperation in future.
The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights will make a decisive contribution towards making democracy and parliamentarianism in the European Union a reality at all levels.
We can be proud, ladies and gentlemen, of our consistent and unequivocal support for the Reform Treaty and for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
(Applause)
We do need the critical public and critical monitoring of our work.
However, we are also entitled to fairness.
The European Union, in all its diversity, is more complex than any other community in the world.
I would ask the media - which play a vital role in our communication with citizens - to bear that in mind.
The European Union should not be used as a scapegoat for national failures.
(Applause)
One of the greatest successes of our European vision over the past 50 years has been the assertion of democracy and freedom all over Europe.
Today, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania and reunited Germany are members of the European Union - an achievement which we could only dream of and which has become a reality in our lifetime.
Today - as the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007 says - we, the citizens of the European Union, have 'united for the better'. That is a cause for great joy.
In taking stock of the past 50 years, it is important that we look to the future.
We should remind ourselves self-critically which aspects of Europe's parliamentary dimension are still unsatisfactory.
Unlike the national parliaments, we still do not have the possibility, in the budget procedure, to decide on the raising of our own financial resources.
Parliamentary government generally entails parliamentary control of the military; however, the European Union's common foreign security and defence policy is still incomplete and does not provide for proper linkage between national and European responsibilities.
We still do not have a uniform electoral law, which means that we are still lacking an important prerequisite for effective European political parties that can stand for election to the European Parliament with single lists of candidates.
With patience, stamina and a good compass, the European Parliament has fought to assert its position in Europe ever since the first session of the European Parliamentary Assembly, and it must and will continue to do so in future.
As Europe's directly elected supranational assembly, the European Parliament is held up as a model for similar efforts in other regions of the world.
I witness this, and so do you, when we visit other parts of the world.
When Robert Schuman took office as the first President of the European Parliamentary Assembly on 19 March 1958, this positive development of Europe's parliamentary dimension would have been almost impossible to predict.
However, Robert Schuman had a vision.
He spoke of the European idea which, he said, had to be revived, describing this as 'la relance de l'idee européenne'.
Today, after the crises surrounding the failed Constitutional Treaty, what could be a better leitmotif for the task that lies ahead?
On 19 March 1958 Robert Schuman, in his brief address, expressed his concern that a technocratic view of matters could cause European integration to wither away.
This is as true today as it was then.
Robert Schuman was realistic, modest and clear in his description of the opportunities available to the Parliamentary Assembly, which he presided over until 1960: 'Nous désirons contribuer', he said in his warm and resonant voice, 'à créer un noyau de la structure européenne.'
Robert Schuman ended his first address as the President of the European Parliamentary Assembly by pledging to work to unify our continent, to unify Europe, which he believed must see itself as a community of values uniting the free nations of our continent: 'Ainsi seulement l'Europe réussira à mettre en valeur le patrimoine total qui est commun à tous les pays libres.'
I would like to build on this.
The European Union is a community of values.
Our institutions are not an end in themselves, but are there to serve our values: the dignity of the individual, human rights, democracy, law, and economic and social prosperity.
They serve the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity.
Europe means respect for each other, respect for our diversity, respect for the dignity of all our Member States, large and small.
This respect cannot be imposed, but is an essential prerequisite for our mutual understanding and common action.
Respect for European law, which enables us to resolve our conflicts amicably and achieve a balance of interests in a peaceful way, must be continually renewed through the unwritten rules that govern our relations in Europe: consideration and respect for one another.
(Applause)
I would like to encourage and urge everyone - no matter where we stand on the political spectrum - to continue to show this respect for each other.
If this mutual respect - marked by tolerance for one another's convictions but remaining true to our own, while being prepared to strike compromises - is successful, the European Union and the European Parliament can stand as a model for peace in the world.
Our European legacy is preserved in the peace and unity of our nations, which have joined together to form the European Union.
We honour Robert Schuman and all the Members of the first European Parliamentary Assembly by endeavouring to be true to their legacy, by working for a responsible and open European Parliament that is close to citizens, but which has the resolve, when necessary, to provide political leadership.
If we continue to work resolutely here, we have no reason to fear the judgment of those who come after us and who, in 2058, will take stock of our work today as they celebrate the European Parliament's 100th anniversary.
Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let us rejoice together in the freedom, peace and unity of our European continent, which we are privileged to serve.
(Loud and sustained applause)
President-in-Office. - (SL) 'My address cannot be devoid of emotion.'
This is how the first President of the European Parliamentary Assembly, Robert Schuman, addressed this respected House for the first time on 19 March 1958.
Fifty years later, on your festive anniversary, we feel exactly the same.
Here I am addressing not only 142 national, but also 785 directly elected Members of the European Parliament.
Looking back at the road we have left behind and at the blossoming of European democracy over the last 50 years should make us proud and very grateful to the fathers of the European concept.
At the same time we are charged with the responsibility to continue the European story of peace, cooperation and prosperity to the best of our ability.
Let us recall the year 1958: society faced with the consequences of two destructive wars, the world of bipolar posturing by western and eastern powers, the cold war, the Cuban revolution, the first chip, nuclear experiments and the launch of the first space satellite.
One hundred and sixty-eight million Europeans were united as the six members of the European Union, which healed war wounds, prospered economically and, together with the Euroatlantic Alliance, secured peace and democracy in the area.
Sadly, the greater part of the remainder of Europe lived in a totalitarian environment of civil and economic stagnation or even regression.
In 2008 we are faced with a completely different picture: the multipolar world is concerned not only with economic and political competition, but also increasingly with cooperation in search of solutions to the present challenges.
The elimination of borders that divided Europe from the Berlin Wall, the elimination of the Iron Curtain and the monitoring of internal borders will continue at the end of this month with the elimination of aerial borders within the enlarged Schengen area.
The territory of the European Union is more than three times larger than 50 years ago and it has three times more inhabitants, 23 official languages, a stronger internal market and a common currency.
On average, the life expectancy of its citizens is eight years longer.
Twenty-seven leaders of governments and nations - one third of us were living in totalitarian regimes 20 years ago - will be making decisions around the same table tomorrow.
Today almost the whole of Europe lives in freedom and democracy.
We should be aware of this achievement and celebrate it.
The life and work of the European Parliament since 1958 clearly reflects the progress achieved through integration over the last 50 years.
After the initial advisory role, in the early seventies you gained the first real competences in respect of the European budget, and at the end of the seventies you had the first direct elections.
With new agreements you obtained stronger competences in adopting legislation and appointing the top European political representatives.
The new European Commission is also unable to exist without your confidence.
In the same way that the Treaty of Rome brought new responsibilities to Parliament in 1958, the Treaty of Lisbon, 50 years later, represents a big step forward for the European Parliament.
The codecision procedure will spread to almost all European policies, and the role of Parliament in democratic supervision, the creation of international agreements and the appointment of the top European representatives will be strengthened.
I was very pleased when at the plenary session last month you adopted the report on the Lisbon Reform Treaty with a large majority.
I would also like to congratulate all the Member States which have already successfully concluded ratification procedures, and I hope that they will soon be followed by all the remaining Member States.
Where the first 50 years of the European Union were devoted to the European agenda, our political and economic development and reforms, the next 50 years will certainly be focused on the global agenda as well.
This is clearly indicated in the list of topics for tomorrow's session of the European Council.
It is absolutely clear that we can find appropriate solutions to the Lisbon challenges, the ecology and energy issues and the turmoil in the financial markets only if we take global trends and players into account and include them in our activities.
This applies to human rights and intercultural dialogue too, where you, the European Parliament, certainly have a leading role.
I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the European Council, to express recognition of your role in pointing out human rights violations and monitoring elections and of the work of your delegations in international institutions such as the United Nations Human Rights Council.
Your role within the framework of joint Parliamentary assemblies is also important and gives added value to European Union policies regarding third countries and regions.
Through your activities and meetings with high-ranking guests during the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, you are strengthening one of the basic European traditions, that is to say the fact that mutual respect and understanding are the basis of coexistence in Europe as well as in the world as a whole.
The range of activities of the European Union is constantly broadening, but they are all governed by a single rule: success is proportional to the degree of unity among the Member States, sectors, common interest groups and generations and within regional, national, European and global factors.
Here the institutions of the European Union must serve as an example.
'Every person is a new world.
Only institutions that preserve the collective experience can mature.'
With this thought Jean Monnet takes us one step closer to explaining why the vision of the European Union is still often different from reality and why many Europeans, despite the very evident successes of the last 50 years, still doubt the benefits of European integration.
To understand and value freedom, peace and diversity, the absence of borders and the benefits and future prospects of a united Europe, we must always be aware that there are other, much worse alternatives.
That is why our common task is to keep the European collective experience alive.
From it we can draw strength to meet the current challenges.
Thoughts of the past must be united with those for the future.
Had we not joined forces 50 years ago, we would probably not be living in peace and prosperity today.
The same can be said about the next 50 years.
If we do not search together for low-carbon and energy-saving solutions, we will not succeed in slowing down climate change.
We will face ever more floods, hurricanes, drought, new diseases, endangered ecosystems and climate refugees.
It is essential that the results of European decisions and activities be sufficiently concrete and tangible for citizens to understand the crucial importance of the European Union in the preservation and improvement of their quality of life.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your contribution to the development of the European Union over the last 50 years.
I know what it has all meant for our generations.
Actually, I was born in the same year as the European Parliament.
Until the end of this mandate and beyond, I wish you much success in your work, plenty of new ideas and steady persistence in the development of European values, democracy and way of life.
I am convinced that when celebrating the next round anniversary of this European house of democracy, we will again be able to celebrate visible progress in Europe.
(applause)
Many thanks to the President of the European Council.
I would now like to ask the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, to take the floor.
President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President-in-Office, Presidents of the various European institutions, former Presidents of the House, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the national parliaments, visiting guests, I am very pleased to be celebrating the European Parliament's first half century with you today.
This anniversary has a considerable symbolic and political meaning for our Europe.
Fifty years ago Robert Schuman presided over a new single Assembly.
The three European Communities had just created the first version of a European democracy.
Since then, this fundamental political choice has been relentlessly reaffirmed at each stage of European integration.
Before anyone else, the founding fathers had the intuition that the emerging Europe required robust democratic European institutions to embody the increasingly stronger ties between the Six.
In accordance with Jean Monnet's inspired vision, these institutions also had to be able to evolve to accompany what they sensed as the dual events of the future: deeper integration and geographic enlargement.
I must tell you it is still extremely moving to see you all here in this house of European democracy, representatives directly elected by nations who until very recently had been divided by dictatorships that prevented Europe from drawing breath in freedom.
(Applause)
The institutional triangle the founding fathers bequeathed us is a model unique to the world that has certainly proved its vitality and solidness after 50 years.
It has adapted to a substantial extension of the scope of the tasks entrusted to the Community, and now to the EU.
It has also coped with a significant dynamic enlargement of our Union.
We owe this success to the ingenuity and equilibrium of our institutional model, which does not follow a classic distribution of powers.
We also owe this success to our operating method, which respects both the Community method and the principle of subsidiarity.
The institutions, however, are not an end in themselves. They remain at the service of an ideal and objectives.
They are at the service of our citizens.
The stronger the institutions, the better they can serve this ideal and our citizens.
Above all, the founding fathers wished to build Europe for the sake of peace.
They wanted to build that new Europe through solidarity.
They chose the economy as the driving force behind their political vision and their objectives.
Fifty years on, Europe at peace, enlarged to continental dimensions, needs strong institutions to cope with the challenge of its time: globalisation.
No Member State can take up this challenge alone.
Through its experience in opening up markets along with rules that embody its values of freedom, solidarity and sustainable development, only Europe simultaneously has the dimensions, the institutions and the instruments required to handle and shape globalisation.
To take up this challenge, the Europe of the 21st century must unite to reap success in the knowledge-based economy, provide jobs for European women and men, and make its economy more dynamic.
It must take up its rightful place on the world stage: a European power, bereft of arrogance, a Europe that will be in a position to propose - not impose, but propose - the values of freedom and solidarity to the world.
We will succeed if we maintain a constructive partnership between our institutions.
Within this partnership I wish to congratulate Parliament on its contribution to the European project in all aspects of the daily lives of all our citizens.
In its 50 years this House has gained many competences and a considerable amount of power.
I mean power that translates as legitimacy arising directly from the votes of European women and men.
I also mean power in the formal sense: codecision, budgetary power and democratic control over the European institutions.
What I really mean is political influence.
The EP has imposed itself simultaneously as a colegislator sharing responsibility within the institutional triangle and in European public life, but also by forging ever closer links with the national parliaments, a large number of which are represented here today.
The power acquired by the EP down through the years has served only to strengthen Europe as a whole.
A strong European Parliament is an essential partner for the other institutions, and - I must emphasise this - for the European Commission.
I think I may say that the relationship between our two institutions is increasingly close, solid and mature, and that pleases me very much indeed.
When the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, it will strengthen the Community institutions even further.
It will broaden the powers of the European Parliament.
It will bolster the dual democratic legitimacy of the Commission through stronger links to the European Parliament and European Council.
It will give the European Council a stable presidency, which will ensure that the preparation and monitoring of European Council meetings are more consistent.
It will develop the role of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who will also be Vice-President of the European Commission.
By reinforcing the legitimacy and efficiency of our institutions, the Lisbon Treaty represents a major step forward for the European Union.
Today, and tomorrow, we must understand that there can be no zero sum game between the institutions.
None of our institutions should be strengthened to the detriment of the others.
On the contrary, we all want stronger European institutions if Europe is to be more efficient and more democratic.
All our institutions will gain from the consolidation of Europe's institutional architecture.
Ladies and gentlemen, in relation to the date we are commemorating today a quote occurred to me from a great Portuguese author, Agustina Bessa Luis.
She said: 'At 15, one has a future, at 25, a problem, at 40, an experience, but before the half-century, one really has no history at all'.
Today the European Parliament, this house of European democracy, can proudly claim it has a fine history in its past, I am sure, but also in its future.
It is for that reason that I would like to offer you, on behalf of the European Commission and on my own behalf, my most sincere congratulations and my very best wishes for your work towards a united Europe.
(Applause)
Many thanks to the President of the European Commission.
I would now like to welcome Hans Joachim Opitz, who is also here with us today and is representing all the former Secretaries-General.
We now have the pleasure of listening once again to the European Union Youth Orchestra.
(Short performance by the European Union Youth Orchestra)
(Loud applause)
(The House rose and listened to the European anthem)

Taxation of unleaded petrol and gas oil (
Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
Madam President, whatever one thinks of the current debate on climate change - and I can sense a lot of hot air all around me - I think we can all agree on the need for more energy efficiency.
But, if we are going to talk about energy efficiency, let us make sure that we actually have some joined-up thinking on this.
I will give an example: our whole policy on energy-saving light bulbs.
Yes, we want to phase out existing light bulbs, but yet we impose tariffs on the import of energy-saving light bulbs.
Yes, we talk about banning mercury in barometers (even though it actually constitutes a very small risk), yet at the same time we are encouraging energy-saving light bulbs which contain, yes, you guessed it, more mercury.
Not only that, but we are talking about energy efficiency, yet we continue to come to Strasbourg, which emits tonnes and tonnes of needless extra CO2.
Therefore, if we really want to take a lead on energy efficiency, we should close down the Strasbourg Parliament.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of Community participation in a research and development programme aimed at enhancing the quality of life of older people through the use of new information and communication technologies.
The project provides development opportunities not only for older people but also for the handicapped, women bringing up children at home and people living in rural areas.
In my view, this initiative will prevent social stratification in Europe in the area of access to digital services, as well as the marginalisation of social groups threatened by less access to modern technology.
However, it is very important to bear in mind that the cost of these technologies must be kept as low as possible.
(PL) I voted in favour of the report on "enhancing the quality of life of older people”, which deals with issues of major importance for many European citizens, especially the older generation.
Older people are dependent on retirement benefits, which are mostly at a very low level.
The problem is growing with the increase in the numbers of older people receiving these funds, which are limited since the number of contributors is falling.
Thus we are heading for a situation in which a large group of older people will be applying for various social benefits.
Many of them, however, are still capable of various kinds of work and can remain active on the labour market.
The growing number of older people, plus the need for a wider range of services and products, increases demand in this area.
(PL) Mr President, I voted against, since the report gives rise to a number of doubts.
I do not support the provisions of the directive on the harmonisation of excise duty rates on gas oil and petrol.
Diversity of excise duty rates creates the possibility of competition among transport firms from different EU countries, which undoubtedly works to the benefit of the consumer.
I also oppose the provisions on the increase of excise duty rates on fuel throughout the European Union.
High oil prices on national markets and the harmonisation of excise duties in all 27 EU countries will put a brake on economic growth in countries with a low GNP.
An increase in fuel prices means an increase in the price of goods and services.
I accordingly voted for the amendments tabled to allow the new Member States, including Poland, to retain different excise duty rates.
(PL) Mr President, I voted against, because the significant increase in excise duty on gas oil will give rise to an increase in customs duty on goods and services in countries which are supposed to charge a rate of excise duty that is lower than the proposed Community minimum but is in any case high with regard to conditions in those countries.
Given that average income in the Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 is relatively low, the proposed increase in excise duty is too great.
Its effects will be felt especially by the poorest families, since the present rise in fuel prices already weighs heavily on their domestic budgets.
The least developed countries, with their low income levels, should therefore be granted much longer transition periods than those proposed by the European Commission, to give them time to adapt.
I consider the proposed increase unjustified and excessive.
Mr President, it is very good to see you back in your chair listening to these explanations of vote, which I know you enjoy so much.
I would also like to say I appreciate the kindness and understanding of your staff and services and interpreters this week whilst we have been making these explanations of vote.
I voted against this particular report for a whole bunch of reasons.
Firstly, I believe in tax competition.
I do not believe tax harmonisation or tax should be a competence of these institutions at all.
Secondly, this week, in my country, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has imposed higher fuel taxes on British car and freight drivers without understanding the consequences of his actions.
I should like to raise a separate problem.
I am running a campaign with the Northampton Chronicle and Echo for the people who live in that vicinity in my region, where we are being charged more for our fuel than all the other major towns around.
I wish to highlight that there are other problems within the fuel market, let alone the problems to do with tax.
Mr President, I would like to echo the comments of my colleague in thanking you, the staff and the interpreters for your kind patience as we seek to deliver these explanations of vote, which at times may be rather entertaining and at times rather boring for you.
I understand that.
But that is the great contrast in this place.
Now, let us talk about tax competition.
We talk about creating the world's largest single market here, and we talk about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world, and we talk about the world competition, yet what do we do when it comes to tax competition?
Well, as it actually says in the explanatory statement, the best way to address the problem of competition would be through full harmonisation.
So here we are, seeing competition as a problem, while at the same time talking about the need for a more competitive economy.
This should not be a competence of the EU.
It is a competence of Member States, and we should leave it as such, because the best way to ensure a competitive economy is to make sure that we have tax competition, not harmonisation.
(PL) Mr President, I voted against.
The European Union has no interest in funding Iraq.
There are other countries in Europe itself that would benefit much more from such aid.
The Caritas Europa report shows that in 14 European countries - including Poland, Austria, Germany and Britain - single parents, especially women, are particularly affected by poverty.
According to an EU report Poland, with 26%, has the highest percentage of children living in poverty of all the EU countries.
One Pole in five (19%) lives below the poverty line.
And 22% of Polish children with at least one working parent are threatened by poverty.
That is the highest figure for Europe.
Thirteen percent of Poles in employment are threatened by poverty.
In Austria, 47% of unemployed single parents live in chronic poverty.
Let us concentrate our efforts on Europe.
Mr President, yesterday when you were in the chair I emphasised how much I always enjoy reading the reports by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in this place and wonder why it exists.
To prove this point today we have a report whose findings are more coherent with somebody who watched too much Prisoner: Cell Block H as a child than on the actual facts of the situation of women in prisons - and whether that should be a competence of this place anyway.
For example, in recital Q, it says: 'whereas the increased number of women in prison is partly due to the worsening economic conditions of women'.
I think, and I have checked with the statistics from a number of countries in the European Union, the number is going up simply because the population is going up.
In fact, the proportion of women in prison across Europe is dropping.
It says here that access to health care of all kinds should be provided to a very high quality in prisons.
Yes, that is absolutely right.
But there are plenty of elderly women in my constituency who would love to have the same benefits of health-care provision that are provided to women inmates in prisons throughout the UK.
So that is why I have abstained on the report.
(NL) I pointed yesterday to Turkey's unassailable position as an aspiring Member State and this report merely confirms that special status.
For weeks Turkey has been bombing the north of Iraq and ten thousand Turkish troops have invaded the country.
And instead of clearly condemning this aggression what does Parliament do?
It politely asks Turkey to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq.
All rules, all principles, all guidelines and criteria have to step aside for Turkish accession, from the Copenhagen criteria to international law and its ban on the use of aggression.
Turkey regards itself as above the law, any law, and is constantly reinforced in that belief by Europe.
One day the European Union will have cause to regret its stance.
(DE) Mr President, I was a sharp and clear critic and opponent of the Iraq war and I still am.
I believe, however, that we must also make up for the mistakes we committed there.
We in the western world - both Europe and the USA - therefore have a duty to do our utmost to secure peace and stability, which will be difficult enough.
That is why the Gomes report is an outstanding one.
We really should use the opportunity to support Mrs Záborská's initiative for the release of the kidnapped archbishop.
I am sorry that as a result of a management mistake on the part of this House the resolution on the subject is not on this afternoon's agenda.
It is our duty to do our utmost to help this representative of a minority whose existence is under threat, which has lived together in peace with its Muslim neighbours for centuries, and which is threatened with genocide precisely at a time when we are responsible in Iraq.
That is not acceptable and that is why we must take strong action here.
(PL) Mr President, I agree with much of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report on the situation of women in prison.
Prison administrations must ensure decent conditions for persons serving prison sentences or under temporary arrest.
I want to draw attention to the situation of women employed in the prison service.
In Poland, 5 000 of the 30 000 prison officers are women.
Prison officers' remuneration does not exceed EUR 500 a month.
Given the role of prison staff in ensuring that sentences are properly served, it important that most officers dealing with women prisoners should be of the same sex.
That lessens the discomfort of women prisoners and ensures better protection of their rights.
Without a significant increase in remuneration and better working conditions in the prison services, we shall not achieve the aims of the report.
Mr President, I voted with my party's whip on this particular report and against many of the amendments.
However, I do have a problem with the contents of the recitals.
It says, 'whereas it is necessary to create a national force for maintaining order that brings together all the communities viewed to be trustworthy by them'.
This is the people of Iraq, the national force created by, I guess, people from within Iraq.
You do wonder actually how much determination the individual Member States that comprise the European Parliament have put behind that effort so far.
All you have to do is look at how many people have supported the efforts in Iraq, believe in them or not.
As we do, we should try and tidy up the problems that we have caused.
I really do think that this resolution shows how trying to have a harmonised EU foreign and security policy in the future will cause us many problems, both in this place and within our Member State capitals.
(DE) Mr President, like the majority of my Group I voted against this report, not because of the subject-matter but because this important issue keeps being exploited for ideological battles about the concepts of sexual and reproductive health and rights.
I want to appeal to all the Groups in this House to put an end to this ideological dispute, which is detrimental to the matter in hand.
We must make it clear that reproductive health is important, but that it has nothing to do with abortion, because that does not come within the European Union's remit and each state has the right to decide its own laws in that area.
That is in line with the principle of subsidiarity, which is why the European citizens' money may not be used for purposes that some EU Member States do not find acceptable on ethical, moral and legal grounds.
We should, therefore, very definitely leave this subject out of our deliberations and concentrate on neutral concepts that actually have something to do with the question of health and nothing to do with the question of abortion, on which opinions differ in this House and where I am strongly in favour of protecting the unborn child.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - Claude Turmes' report on the Global Energy and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF) is one that I endorse.
The GEEREF will use limited public funds to encourage private investment in energy efficient and renewables orientated projects in developing countries and economies in transition.
A fund that helps everyone achieve a certain level of energy efficiency and embrace renewables has my support and I voted in favour of it.
in writing. - (RO) The resolution refers to the creation of an innovative financial instrument to support the implementation of certain projects financed by this fund in view of the transition to an economy with low carbon dioxide emissions and adaptation to the effects of climate change.
The development of this type of economy by means of projects financed by the fund means the creation of new jobs, equal conditions for social development and elimination of discrepancies.
In this sense, the special support granted to SMEs in access to funding of their GEEREF projects is beneficial.
I voted for this resolution because I believe that these two forms of action, namely the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to the effects of climate change, must be developed in parallel, by means of coherent and convergent policies with a positive impact on the development of labour market/creation of new jobs and GDP increase.
in writing. - (PT) In general terms it can be said that the purpose of this report is to encourage the integration of the 'new' Member States into EU external policy, particularly 'development cooperation policy' and 'European neighbourhood policy'.
The report also considers that the 'new' Member States represent an opportunity for the EU 'to reinforce its strategic presence in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus', regions with which the 'new' Member States have priority relationships and which have received less EU 'aid' to date.
This means seeking to make use of the privileged relationship of the eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 as an EU intervention instrument (taking into account the interests of the major powers and their large economic and financial groups, particularly in the energy sector) in the countries of the Community of Independent States, the Western Balkans and the Caucasus.
That is, seeking to make use of those countries' 'experience' of 'transition' to capitalism and to inclusion in NATO and the EU as a model to be followed in these regions.
This is ultimately what is at issue: a policy that disguises the interests of capitalism with 'development'.
in writing. - I support DanutBudreikaitė's report on the challenge of EU development cooperation policy for new Member States.
While the EU's new Member States, excluding Malta and Cyprus, provide unique expertise for the application and targeting of development policy in our neighbour countries to the East, we must actively encourage their involvement with Sub-Saharan Africa and other LDCs.
Our new Members strengthen the EU's role as a world partner and should be fully encouraged in that role.
The report and its recommendations have my support.
in writing. - (PT) The mere fact that we are discussing the role of the new Member States in European Union cooperation and development policies, particularly with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, is clear evidence of the success of the process of enlargement and of the integration of the countries that have joined in recent years.
The 'former Eastern European countries' certainly had a long tradition of 'cooperation' with Africa, and it may be that the links remain, though in completely different terms.
The most relevant issue, however, is that these countries, which are still struggling valiantly with the costs of their reforms, are now capable of contributing to cooperation and development with the active consent of their populations.
This exemplary way forward could and we hope will be followed by other countries in largely the same circumstances in other parts of the world.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of Mrs Budreikaitė's report on the challenge of EU development cooperation policy for the new Member States.
The report is of a very high quality, providing a detailed analysis of the current situation of development cooperation by the new Member States, the institutions and programmes involved, the recipient countries and the relevant financial contributions.
The issues dealt with in the report put the emphasis on relations between the EU Member States and their new eastern neighbours.
The new Member States are important links between the EU and its new neighbours.
I personally would call for the development of effective forms of cooperation between old and new donors in favour of less developed countries, taking advantage of the predominant influence of the new Member States in specific regions or countries.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mrs Gill's report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation by the Community in a research and development programme.
This programme seeks to enhance the quality of life of older people through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).
European Union participation in this programme will ensure that it is better able to address the demographic challenges.
The use of ICT may help older people to become more independent and to remain healthy, and may enhance their quality of life.
in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this report, which deals with the European Commission proposal on the EU's involvement in the research and development programme that various EU Member States have decided to set up in the field of the new Information Technologies (ICT) to help people as they get older and to enable them to act effectively.
The programme is entitled 'Ambient Assisted Living', and seeks to obtain synergies in terms of management and financial resources.
Portugal is also taking part.
The report, which the European Parliament has now approved, draws attention to and makes concrete proposals for promoting the role of women in science and research, and places stress on the involvement of SMEs and on fair access for all Members States to cost-effective solutions so as to avoid widening the digital divide and thus creating a two tier Europe.
It is also proposed that the Commission should conduct an interim evaluation by 2010 to assess the quality and efficiency of the implementation of the programme.
in writing. - (FR) I should like to make two comments on the Gill report, which is essentially about organising research programmes with a view to making older people more independent through the use of information and communication technologies.
The first point is on the substance of the proposals: it is hard to see what added value the European Union would bring to a project initiated, quite legitimately, by a number of Member States - aside from making the process more bureaucratic and setting up a new Community body.
The Union's financial largesse, to the tune of EUR 150 million over a number of years minus the operating costs of the aforesaid new body, does not seem like a clinching argument.
My second point concerns the form of the proposals.
It is increasingly common for legislative reports to be presented in this House in the form of a compromise between Parliament and the Council - the idea being to speed the process by facilitating their adoption at first reading.
In effect, however, what we see is the legislative body held hostage by a handful of expert negotiators.
I regard the spread of this practice as a threat to democracy.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing European Union participation in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) research and development programme that has been undertaken jointly by a number of Member States and third countries.
Population ageing is a challenge to European society and to Europe's economy.
Average life expectancy today is 80 years and the number of people in the 65-80 age bracket will increase by approximately 40% between 2010 and 2030.
New solutions are emerging to help people cope with the memory loss, impaired vision, hearing or mobility and loss of independence which are more likely to afflict us as we age.
European Union participation in the programme is envisaged in the context of the European Commission's seventh Framework Research and Development Programme.
The European Union will provide EUR 150 million to cofinance projects that will have a leverage effect worth at least EUR 600 million between 2008 and 2013.
The countries taking part in the AAL programme are also to help finance it by making an equivalent or greater contribution, which means that each country will invest at least 20% of its national research budget in this field.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of Mrs Gill's report 'Enhancing the quality of life of older people', which aims to promote the use of modern information and communication technology as a means of support for the elderly.
As we know, our societies are marked by ever-increasing life expectancy.
That is a very positive trend.
The EU average is now 80 years, and the proportion of people in the 65+ age bracket will shortly reach 40%.
The technologies in question can significantly help such people in various situations, including the prolongation of professional and social activity and improvement of the quality of life.
Naturally, the specific needs of handicapped people must also be taken into account, and access to these services and technologies must be ensured mainly through the provision of broadband internet connections in both urban and rural areas so as to avoid geographical discrimination.
in writing. - (DE) I am in favour of cofinancing by the European Union of the 'Ambient Assisted Living' programme, since it would benefit not just older people but also other population groups, such as those with disabilities.
It is precisely because of the major demographic change in the European population and the rising life expectancy over recent decades that we must support new information and communication technologies that would make it considerably easier for older people to cope with the everyday hurdles facing them.
In regard to the general cost reduction in the health sector as a result of the use of these new technologies, I would also draw your attention to the research into 'mobile health monitoring' systems, the use of which would reduce annual health costs by EUR 1500 million in Germany alone.
Let me underline that one of the benefits of cofinancing is that it would also have a positive impact on the private sector, as it would indirectly assist small and medium-sized enterprises.
I strongly support the AAL Joint Programme because the use of new technologies means continued respect for the private life of older people and allows them to grow old with dignity.
in writing. - I back Nina Gill's report 'Enhancing the quality of life of older people'.
In pooling resources and coordinating research and development on a European level we are more adequately able to assess how to improve the lives of our older citizens.
By setting a minimum contribution we ensure the participation of all Member States in this cause.
I would like to commend the rapporteur on her report and support the recommendations contained within.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to support the report in its entirety since, in our view, the EU must prioritise action on unhealthy tax competition in the fuel sector, in particular with a view to enabling the EU to achieve its climate objectives.
The tax harmonisation proposal would also not prevent individual Member States from raising their CO2 taxes on petrol and diesel.
This is a further important reason for supporting the report.
in writing. - (PT) This proposal for a directive seeks to narrow the price differences on fuel among the various Member States that lead to distortions in terms of competition and the environment in road transport activity.
The difference in prices of gas oil used as motor fuel and unleaded petrol are indeed significant.
Hence its importance for Portugal, one of the countries in which this situation is making itself felt, bearing in mind the price differences between our country and Spain: Portuguese enterprises suffer competition from Spanish enterprises because the latter benefit from lower fuel prices - fuel representing around 30% of costs - due to lower fuel tax (and VAT).
Portuguese enterprises have justified the stagnation of workers' fixed wages by this pressure on costs, with serious consequences for the labour force.
The European Parliament's proposal is more positive because it eliminates the transitional periods under Article 18, a very important aspect in the current situation, in the hope that it will make it possible to reduce the difference between Portugal and Spain in 2010, since the latter will have to increase its fuel tax from EUR 302 to EUR 330 in the case of gas oil.
The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015.
In the case of unleaded petrol, unfortunately, there will be no change by this means.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against the Schmidt report because what the European Parliament has engaged in here, instead of supporting the Commission initiative, is a sort of conjuring trick playing off the old against the new Member States.
In any event the decision will ultimately rest with the Ministers alone and it will have to be unanimous.
in writing. - (FR) Higher taxation and more controls: that is the Brussels recipe for Europe!
Harmonising excise duties, just like harmonising VAT by imposing binding minimum rates such as we have had now for 15 years, is demonstrably ineffective, utterly unnecessary and in some cases even damaging.
Do I need to remind you that measures like this prevent Member States from reducing, for example, VAT in the catering industry, even though that is a sector where the case for distorting cross-border competition is particularly flimsy and where lowering VAT could help to create thousands of jobs?
Do I need to remind you that the new Member States are being forced to apply tax increases that their people find quite outrageous, in order to comply with European rules - while at the same time being required, under other European rules, to cut their rates of inflation?
The current proposal is to increase tax on diesel in line with tax on unleaded petrol, the pretexts being a desire to protect the environment and an alleged need to combat 'taxation tourism' - by which we mean ordinary people taking advantage of competition!
It is all the more scandalous because drivers in a country like France have been encouraged to buy diesel-powered vehicles - presumably so that we can now clobber them harder than ever!
in writing. - (PT) This explanation of vote seeks to stress that we are once again wasting an opportunity at EU level - since the mechanism exists - to take action to protect small-scale coastal fishing by failing to apply to petrol at least the same conditions of taxation enjoyed by users of gas oil for farming and fishing.
It should be remembered that petrol is the fuel used by vessels in this important and largest segment of the various Member States' fleets, notably Portugal's.
In its 28 September 2006 resolution on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry, the European Parliament, considering that increased fuel prices have a particularly negative effect on the fishing industry - significantly aggravating the existing socioeconomic crisis and drastically reducing fishermen's incomes - and stressing that there is a serious risk of the disappearance of thousands of fisheries enterprises and the loss of thousands of jobs, adopted a range of proposals to support the sector so that it can cope with increased fuel prices.
A year and a half later, apart from the increase in the 'de minimis' aid, virtually nothing has been done at EU level.
in writing. - The goal of Olle Schmidt's report 'Taxation of unleaded petrol, gas and oil' is to attend to the disparities in excise duty on fuel across the Union.
The current imbalance has encouraged fuel tourism, which has economic and environmental ramifications.
Measures need to be taken to ensure that this practice is discouraged.
Nevertheless I recognise the needs of new Member States still engaged in the process of economic development, who will require time to adjust to the measures proposed.
I voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (FR) The purpose of the Commission proposal was to introduce measures for reducing CO2 emissions in accordance with the stated aims of the energy and climate change package.
However, neither the Commission proposal nor the report adopted today addresses the urgent need to develop a fuel capable of making a real difference in the fight against CO2 emissions.
The disparity of the planned adjustments and the way they are to be spread, both over time and geographically across the Union, will make the proposed measures ineffective.
If we really intend to move into a 'clean-air era', we ought to be more environmentally imaginative and support measures that will allow us to tackle climate disruption effectively.
The taxation-change approach proposed by the Commission and by Olle Schmidt's report fails to promote either research or the concept of a new alternative fuel to curb CO2 emissions.
I want to take a clear stand today in opposition to the thinking behind this report and that is why I voted against what is simply a compromise that subverts the declared aim.
in writing. - (IT) The Gomes report takes stock of the dramatic and difficult situation in which Iraq finds itself.
The non-governmental organisations and the various bodies responsible for rebuilding the region are not in practice managing to resolve the problems arising from decades of war, dictatorship and sanctions.
In this context, it is the duty of the European institutions to support a multi-faceted strategy for Iraq which increases direct EU support for technical assistance to promote the rule of law, justice and sound financial management in order to safeguard fundamental human rights by creating regional stability and security.
Parliament therefore urges the Council to encourage investment by European enterprises in Iraqi territory, and to conduct the negotiations on the trading agreement between the EU and Iraq so that the Iraqi market can be brought more into line with European regulations.
In substance, the European Parliament's proposal, with which I fully agree, suggests a new strategy for Iraq including appropriate use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and support for a pluralist and independent information system.
As the Committee on Development's rapporteur for the Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013 report, I shall now work to increase the financial appropriation allocated to Iraq: the dissemination of culture is a fundamental step in creating a genuine rule of law.
in writing. - (PT) The resolution adopted achieves the 'astonishing' feat of not making a single reference to the brutal and illegal aggression and occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies.
The resolution glosses over the whole death toll of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the destruction of an entire country and the premeditated and massive disrespect for human rights resulting from the aggression and occupation.
The resolution is completely silent on the first and foremost reason for the extremely serious problems the Iraqi people and their country are now facing, and thus on how to resolve it: the immediate withdrawal of all occupying troops.
In essence, the resolution endorses the status quo, presenting it as a fait accompli and seeking to promote greater EU participation in the intervention in Iraq, seeing this country as another 'state supervised' by the USA/NATO/EU, like Afghanistan and Kosovo.
This is astounding, in that at the same time it considers that neighbouring countries must refrain from any interference in Iraq and must respect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the desire of the Iraqi people to build the country's constitutional and political system by their own efforts.
Hence our vote against.
in writing. - I voted for this report, despite the view expressed in one of the recitals that sees all problems in Iraq as being down to the previous regime.
There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was a vicious dictator and caused the deaths of many of his people, not least in the systematic attempt to wipe out the Kurds.
However, the total lack of any strategy by the occupying forces to deal with rebuilding the country has also resulted in untold misery.
I am very pleased, however, that Parliament took the view that no country should be forcibly returning people to Iraq.
The country is not safe, not even Iraqi Kurdistan, which has recently seen Turkish tanks cross its borders, causing further fear and instability.
We were told by members of many parties in the Iraqi Parliament that return is dangerous and potentially destabilising for the country itself.
We have also heard in the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the plight of the millions of Iraqis living as refuges in neighbouring countries with little support from the international community.
We should support the public services in those states and at least educate the children.
in writing. - (FR) The representatives of the Movement for France in the European Parliament have taken a consistent stand since the beginning of the US intervention in Iraq.
Our country's own experience and its ties with the Iraqi people alerted us to the human, military and moral disaster that the intervention would bring.
Now the damage is done and it is up to the Member States to act, either alone or collectively, to rescue and re-establish whatever can be salvaged.
Before the US intervention, Iraq was the only Muslim country that was home to a large and prosperous Christian community - a community that had lived there even before the arrival of Islam.
One of the most tragic consequences of the US intervention has been the exodus of sections of that community, driven out by terror and intimidation.
It is a calamity for Iraq, today and in the future.
In the bigger picture, the rapid erosion of a religious population mix in the Middle East spells human and economic impoverishment and threatens the entire region's stability and prosperity.
The historian Fernand Braudel considered that history began in Sumaria, but it would seem today that the long history of Christian minorities in Iraq is at an end.
We, the nations of Europe, simply cannot condone this enormous injustice by failing to act.
Iraqi Christian communities were once open and welcoming to Islam, and together with their Muslim neighbours they built a country that was prosperous before it was ravaged by fanaticism and wars.
(Explanation of vote cut short under Rule 163)
in writing. - I am pleased to see that Ana Gomes' report on the EU's role in Iraq looks forward and formulates a strategy to build a robust democratic Iraqi state that respects human rights and the country's rich ethnic and confessional make-up.
Iraq needs Europe to help build upon the recent security improvements that will go a long way in encouraging investment and increased NGO involvement in reconstructing the country.
All of Europe has an interest in a stable and secure Iraq and I feel the report's recommendations recognise this.
The report is intended to ensure that the EU has a better share in the imperialist booty from the war against Iraq and interventions in the wider region of the Middle East.
In this context:
it seeks ways and means of establishing an EU presence in the country on a long-term basis in order to 'help European firms to bid for contracts to rebuild Iraq', i.e. to increase the share of the spoils received by EU monopolies.
it calls for unconditional aid to the collaborationist 'government' of Iraq.
it puts forward strategies for active participation in the imperialist occupation.
In order for military and police forces to form part of the occupying armies, all that is needed is for different hats to be worn and for the name to be changed to 'UN forces'.
Therefore, while cynically recognising the catastrophic consequences of the war and the slaughter of the Iraqi people, the report hastily states that events have been wrapped up.
The report legitimises not only the occupying armies, which it terms a 'Multi-National Force', but even the private firms of murderers active in Iraq, provided that rules are set for their criminal activities!
The Communist Party of Greece condemns the report.
It expresses its solidarity with the resistance of Iraqis and the struggle of the peoples of the region for liberation from the imperialist yoke of occupation and for their inalienable right to decide their own destinies.
in writing. - (PT) The fact that Parliament has decided to discuss the future of the European Union's role in Iraq, rather than insisting on a pointless debate on past issues, is positive.
The five years of importance to us now are the next five years rather than the last.
The starting point for any debate on this issue must now be to recognise that the situation on the ground has improved significantly, though it is still very serious.
What that improvement reveals in particular is that there is a viable way forward in the objective of building a democratic and secure state.
Our objective can be achieved.
Experience in recent years, however, also shows that it will only be achieved with greater commitment, by increasing security, by investing in training the Iraqi authorities and, very importantly, contributing actively to the creation of infrastructure that will make the country's economy viable, besides oil.
In the European Union's specific case, this involves investing heavily in the economic reconstruction of Iraq and in building democracy in the country.
A democratic and safe Iraq that respects human rights is vital for the region and for the world.
in writing. - (DE) Of course I know that we voted in plenary on the draft report by my colleague Ana Gomes on the role of the European Union and not on her explanatory statement to the report.
Yet I think it is important that in her explanatory statement the rapporteur once again underlines the fact that the invasion of Iraq was a strategic and humanitarian disaster and that Iraqi society was traumatised afresh by the war and the ensuing chaos and violence.
I welcome the fact that in addition to all the other important points she makes the rapporteur refers explicitly to the need to ensure that women have a stronger role and to promote respect for the rights of women, minorities and children if good work is to be done in Iraq.
in writing. - (NL) I find it regrettable that the European Parliament has so far produced no analysis at all of the war in Iraq.
In recent years Parliament has in fact maintained a deafening silence and not even challenged the lies put out by the Bush Administration.
For a democratic body like Parliament that matters very much!
It will be hard for us to retain credibility if we do not even act against UN Members which flout the UN Charter.
Mrs Gomes gives us an assessment of the situation in Iraq.
Her report on the European Union's role in Iraq includes a number of good recommendations for rebuilding the country.
It addresses a range of subjects and all the measures proposed seem to me to be achievable.
I particularly welcome the proposals for multilateral efforts, under UN supervision, to get intensive diplomatic talks under way between the US and Iraq's neighbours.
The aim has to be to establish democracy in Iraq, based on the principles of the rule of law, good governance and human rights.
So I support the report.
in writing. - (FR) The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War stipulates that humanitarian, medical and religious personnel are to be respected and protected.
It is vital that we support the case of Monsignor Paulos Faraj Rahho, the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop born and resident in Mosul, who was kidnapped on Friday 29 February 2008.
The three people with him at the time of his abduction were killed by the kidnappers.
It was not possible, in an oral amendment to the Gomes report, to mention Monsignor Rahho by name.
For that reason I would ask the President explicitly to send two letters of support and encouragement on Parliament's behalf:
one to Iraq's Shiite Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, who has condemned the attacks on Christian clergy and has offered, on behalf of the Iraqi Government, 'protection and justice' for Christians, with an assurance that those responsible for the violence will be hunted down and punished;
the other to the Vice-President of Iraq, Tareq al-Hashemi, a member of the Sunni community, who has also denounced terrorist attacks on Christian communities in no uncertain terms and who, following the kidnapping, expressed solidarity with what he called 'our Christian brothers'.
It is vital that we encourage the national authorities to do all in their power to secure the immediate and unconditional release of Monsignor Paulos Faraj Rahho.
in writing. - I will be supporting this resolution.
It is essential as I said in my report from more than a decade ago that we have a binding legal basis for our code of conduct on arms exports.
Yet the imperative to export is driven by a divided European industry that is desperate for long production so as to enable it to compete with mass-produced armaments from the US with only batch production domestic demand.
Thus we need to see a single market in defence equipment which will enable Europe to first compete, second to stop feeding regional wars around the world and third move some of its most highly qualified scientists and engineers into the new advanced technology industries of tomorrow.
in writing. - (SV) Some Member States have a vested interest in the promotion of arms exports.
Hence, if a common code of conduct for arms exports is drawn up, it is likely that certain Member States with a more restrictive policy may be forced to compromise.
We take the view that the surveillance of arms exports is best achieved by each Member State working through its national legislation.
Sweden must continue to have the right to pursue a restrictive policy on arms exports if it so wishes.
Cooperation is desirable in order to secure further progress in global disarmament work, but this is best achieved on an international basis within the context of the United Nations, having regard to the UN's experience, expertise and global coverage.
in writing. - (PT) An effective EU code of conduct on arms exports undoubtedly becomes increasingly important in the context of its rapid militarisation, which is mirrored in the draft Treaty currently being ratified in each Member State.
Not without a certain irony, the resolution itself specifically refers to 'the evolving European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), in which more and more EU military and civilian missions are being deployed (...) where EU personnel might be threatened with arms previously supplied by EU Member States'.
The 'military equipment market' is expanding in the EU, 'several initiatives to harmonise national arms procurement policies and intra-Community arms transfers and sales' are being encouraged, and there is a 'willingness to increase arms exports as a tool to promote economic interests'.
The watchword has been given: an arms race and the militarisation of international relations.
Initiatives and measures seeking at the very least to mitigate such an escalation are therefore positive and necessary.
As we stated previously, however, arms trade regulation will be much more significant if it is accompanied by a process of multilateral and reciprocal disarmament, beginning in particular by dismantling the huge nuclear arsenals.
in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation voted against the resolution on the basis that it does not accept the references to the Lisbon Treaty or to the evolving ESDP, both of which it opposes.
Furthermore, while it is strongly in favour of a responsible arms transfer policy, it is not convinced of the merits of a legally binding Code of Conduct, imposed by the EU, in advance of an internationally binding Arms Trade Treaty.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted for the report since it is important that prison conditions be improved in certain institutions in Europe and that prisoners' human and fundamental rights be respected.
Furthermore, an equality perspective must be integrated into the treatment of offenders and prison operation.
However, we have certain objections to some of the content of the report.
We do not want harmonisation of prison conditions in Europe and we have strong misgivings over references in the report to special criminal sanctions or alternative penalties for women, pregnant women and women with young children.
As regards a child's contact with its parents during periods of custody and thereafter, account should be taken, with the focus on the child's best interests, of both parents and not just the mother or the one parent.
in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues believe that ways should always be looked at to improve the situation of women in prison.
The report suggests a number of possibilities that could be explored further, including the provision of health services.
However, the report is overly prescriptive in what it asks of Member States in this area.
It is for Member States to decide on the details of prison policy.
In particular, we are unable to agree with the premise of Recital C and Recital Q, which we believe distort other aspects of the report that may have value.
For these reasons, we have decided to abstain.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report on the particular situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life, since there is evidence that European prisons are geared largely towards male prisoners and overlook women's specific needs.
I therefore believe that measures should be adopted to promote the improvement of the situation of women prisoners, particularly in terms of their social and professional reintegration, health care and hygiene, psychological support and the preservation of family ties.
in writing. - (PT) Although women represent around 4.5 to 5% of the prison population in the European Union, prisons continue to be geared basically towards male prisoners and tend to overlook the specific problem of the small but growing percentage of women prisoners.
The principal areas of concern are health care, the situation of imprisoned women with children and professional and social reintegration.
Specific attention should be paid to women's health care and hygiene needs.
Pregnant women prisoners in particular require specialised resources and attention in respect of diet, exercise, clothing, medication and medical care by specialised personnel.
Children who remain with their imprisoned mothers require adequate protection and care and should not suffer from any form of discrimination.
Imprisonment of women can have particularly grave implications when they have been the sole carers of their children prior to imprisonment.
Social inclusion of prisoners must be prepared during and after imprisonment with the cooperation of social services and other relevant organisations in order to ensure a smooth transition from prison to liberty.
in writing. - (SV) We support the work being done in the Member States to modernise and adapt penal policy in order to make better provision for the needs of prisoners and, as part of this, to take account of the specific needs of women.
As the treatment of offenders does not fall under the powers of the EU, we have chosen to vote against the report.
Measures concerned with visiting regulations, the operation of institutions, training of staff in the penal system, prisoners' leisure activities or social assistance are and should remain a matter for the Member States, so that they can be adapted and developed in accordance with national and local needs.

in writing. - I agree with the findings outlined in Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report on the situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life.
Prison remains orientated towards the needs of male prisoners and I welcome the report's aim to highlight the differences experienced by women.
I endorse the report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report because there is an urgent need to adapt conditions of imprisonment to address women's specific needs.
Even today, prison conditions in many Member States remain very poor and are certainly not geared to providing the particular types of support that women require.
There are specific issues for women prisoners that demand specific attention, notably in the matter of access to healthcare.
That is why I supported the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group calling for women prisoners to have the same access as other women to screening programmes for breast cancer and cervical cancer.
The fact is that early diagnosis of these conditions improves the chances of curing them, so the denial of access to such screening programmes can effectively impose an additional penalty on female prisoners.
Furthermore, women are still central to the family unit.
In the case of mothers, provided that they pose no threat to public order, we should therefore try to facilitate forms of punishment other than imprisonment, wherever possible.
in writing. - (SV) This is an area for which there are no powers at EU level.
Despite some positive proposals, the report is too concerned with detailed regulation.
I therefore abstain in the vote.
in writing. - When voting for any policy which includes the term 'sexual and reproductive health' we understand this to mean the protection and enhancement of the life and health of the mother and the unborn.
We do not accept any other definition that infers abortion to be within this term; and furthermore we understand that any care, information, policies or any other services pertaining to sexual and reproductive health similarly exclude abortion.
We will work to have this definition accepted at every forum and body we can influence.
We note the reply given by the Council Presidency in Parliament on 4 December 2003 that the term reproductive health does not include the promotion of abortion and, inter alia, that abortion should never be presented as a method of family planning, contrary to what the WHO states on fertility regulation.
It is clear, therefore, that the WHO definition is not binding on or even accepted by governmental and parliamentary institutions.
We will continue to support policies to promote responsible sexual practices, and to protect and enhance the life and health of the mother and the unborn, including supporting the provision of resources to achieve these objectives.
in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report seeks to integrate the equality perspective into the EU's development cooperation.
Junilistan is opposed to aid at EU level and is therefore voting against the report.
However, several of the amendments which have been tabled by certain Members are of a less congenial nature.
The right of women to sexual and reproductive health is an important element in promoting development.
In this case, we have chosen to support the original proposals as a counterbalance to the disagreeable tendencies in this Parliament.
Work on these questions and development cooperation, however, should in principle be pursued at global level through the UN, not the EU.
in writing. - (PT) We consider this report to have several merits, one of which is to draw attention to a major problem, both in the EU and in developing countries: the need to ensure access to information on sexual and reproductive health, to ensure freedom of decision, and to create and promote public services to protect and apply the rights of everyone, particularly women.
We believe that it should be emphasised, however, that the greatest contribution to 'gender equality and women's empowerment in development cooperation' will come not from policies that promote relationships of dependency and domination, market liberalisation (see the EU Economic Partnership Agreements - EPA), the exploitation of workers, inequalities and social injustice and disrespect for human rights, which afflict millions and millions of children and women in particular, but from a policy of effective cooperation based on equal rights between states, respect for national sovereignty and the right of each country to define and implement a development model that meets its people's needs and concerns, i.e. a policy that interprets the word 'solidarity' accurately.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this amendment, because I strongly believe that fighting against violence, in this case sexual violence against women in crises and conflict areas, has to be the highest priority.
The EU cannot tolerate any kind of violence and therefore I find that the emphasis should be on fighting against sexual violence targeted against women.
Furthermore I think that traditions are not to be seen as something evil.
Sexual and reproductive health and rights are sensitive issues, including traditional societal and also religious dimensions, and therefore should not be generalised and thereby forced upon societies, especially fragile societies, where drastic changes in traditional ways of living can harm the fragile society more than they bring benefits.
in writing. - (DE) I vote for gender equality and the empowerment of women in development cooperation.
The way women in developing countries are disadvantaged by religious rules, cultural practices and poverty is usually further worsened by the lack of education.
In that regard I want in particular to draw attention to the potentially enormous social pressure that could come from raising public awareness of women's basic rights, which could in the final analysis improve the situation of women in the regions concerned.
I further support the idea of regarding 'violence against women' not purely in terms of female victims but of also developing practical programmes addressing the 'male abusers' aspect, as proposed in Mrs Uca's report.
I too am highly critical of the Commission's failure to include a strategy against culture- or religion-based violence against women in its list of measures.
Poor access to education leads to disadvantages in other areas of life for the simple reason of lack of information.
To be poorly informed in this respect can have lethal consequences in developing countries in which health provision and standards of hygiene are often appalling.
I need only refer to the alarmingly high percentage of HIV-infected women - south of the Sahara the figure is 57%.
One extremely positive point is the call for 'gender-sensitive performance indicators' to be developed, which would also make the controversial subject of quotas less acrimonious.
in writing. - When voting for any policy which includes the term 'sexual and reproductive health' I understand this to mean the protection and enhancement of the life and health of the mother and the unborn.
I do not accept any other definition that infers abortion to be within this term; and furthermore I understand that any care, information, policies or any other services pertaining to sexual and reproductive health similarly exclude abortion.
We should work to have this definition accepted at every forum and body we can influence.
I note the reply given by the Council Presidency in Parliament on 4 December 2003 that the term reproductive health does not include the promotion of abortion and, inter alia, that abortion should never be presented as a method of family planning, contrary to what the WHO states on fertility regulation.
It is clear, therefore, that the WHO definition is not binding on or even accepted by governmental and parliamentary institutions.
I will continue to support policies to promote responsible sexual practices, and to protect and enhance the life and health of the mother and the unborn, including supporting the provision of resources to achieve these objectives.
in writing. - Feleknas Uca's report 'Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Cooperation' welcomes the Commission's strategy on the issue.
I reiterate this approval of a strategy that seeks to mainstream gender equality in development cooperation.
I have voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (FR) While gender equality has been an integral part of the European Union's development cooperation programmes for many years now, actual progress is still too slow.
The European Commission therefore needs to set itself targets, in terms of figures and deadlines, so that development can become the main driver of improved living conditions for women.
To that end, the Union needs to focus on three priorities in the partnerships that it enters into: fundamental freedoms, women's status in public life and their access to healthcare.
On the one hand, the Commission needs to be more vigilant than ever with regard to violations of women's physical integrity and human dignity (in the form of torture, traditional practices of mutilation and forced marriage).
At the same time, cooperation must entail recognition of women's place in society, which affects everything from access to knowledge through to financial independence.
In addition, commitments are needed so that by 2010 the prevention and treatment of AIDS in developing countries will be a reality.
European development policy will fall flat on its face if it cannot bring about genuine change in women's circumstances.
The report, despite its accurate findings on the tragic state of women in developing countries, conceals what is to blame: capitalist production methods and the brutal imperialist interventions by the EU, the United States and other imperialist states and organisations.
They prey on these countries and plunder their wealth-producing sources, which all results in hunger and the impoverishment of millions of people.
The solutions proposed operate within the bounds of capitalist development and the EU's developmental aid.
Another typical aspect of this approach is the proposal to reinforce female entrepreneurship in order to increase employment.
In this context, the proposals for fairer and more democratic societies, access for girls and women to education and health services, the eradication of poverty, disease, etc., are hot air.
They are mere wishes diverting attention away from the truth, because meeting the people's needs is incompatible with the supreme principle of capitalist development and the pursuit of profit.
For every euro that the EU gives, it steals thousands from these countries.
The improvement of the position of women and the living conditions of the peoples of these countries will be achieved not through the legalised robbery of 'EU developmental aid', but through resistance to imperialist intervention, the quest for equal international relations and the struggle for a different developmental approach based on the needs of the people.
in writing. - (DE) This report on equality and participation, on the role of women in development cooperation, covers a great number of different aspects and also includes important practical demands.
As a whole, therefore, it should definitely be supported.
One theme that runs through the entire report is sexual and reproductive health and violence against women, together with promoting women's right to self-determination.
It is important to expand the micro-financing networks, because micro-credits can help improve women's economic situation.
I cannot understand why people are trying to table various draft amendments that weaken the report and are simply dismissing UN documents that are on hand.
in writing. - (PL) The Uca report on gender equality in development policy is an expression of European moral imperialism vis-à-vis the developing countries.
It exports the sick social model of the rich European countries to the countries of Africa and Asia.
The repeated references to reproductive rights denote support for generalised abortion.
I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report.
in writing. - (FR) Equality between men and women is a priority in developing countries.
I greatly appreciate the thorough and painstaking work that Mrs Uca has done on this important subject.
Nonetheless, I voted against the report because the substance of certain paragraphs in the final version, which refer to sexual and reproductive health in imprecise terms, remains ambiguous.
Conflicting interpretations persist and some of them imply a threat to the lives of unborn children.
In the next report on the subject, women's health should not be seen solely in relation to reproduction, for all women have the right to an environment that allows them to enjoy continuing good health.
That means paying particular attention to supplies of safe drinking water, proteins and basic medication, alongside traditional medicines.
Since Gertrude Mongella's visit on 6 March 2008, marking International Women's Day, I would also say that we have a lot to learn from African wisdom with regard to gender equality: it is something that is lived there and is passed on in oral traditions among women and men who are blessed with good spiritual and mental health.
All of us could take inspiration from that.

Russia (vote)
- Before voting commenced:
author, on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) I wish to propose a stylistic amendment.
The words "European Court” should be replaced by "European Court of Human Rights”, otherwise the text will be unintelligible.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
Request for waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)
International Financial Reporting Standards and the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (debate)
The next item is the report by Alexander Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, the subject matter of the report before us would seem, at first glance, to be highly technical.
It concerns so-called accounting standards in the European Union and worldwide, particularly for small and medium-sized companies.
It may very well be the type of subject that is discussed now in the European Parliament and then takes several years to begin to affect the economy and ordinary people.
At that stage the cry will go up that nobody knows where these standards come from or who is responsible for them.
Nor will anyone know why they have to be applied.
The objective is to achieve a single set of global accounting standards, particularly for public limited companies.
We support that objective.
The argument we hear advanced for it is that we need 'high quality standards', and this House considers itself the only forum empowered to set those high quality standards.
However, in these times of turbulence on the financial markets, it is astonishing to hear the same people who previously argued for the principle of 'fair value' now questioning that principle and asking, too, whether a 'market to market' approach still makes sense if we no longer have a market.
The very people who let the genie out of the bottle are the ones now asking whether we are on the right track.
The only people responsible for these standards are the people sitting in the offices of this private organisation in London, who are undoubtedly influenced in making their standards by the desire to keep themselves in a job.
My report, on which we are to vote today, therefore concerns not just the impact on small and medium-sized companies, but also the fundamental question of who makes rules for whom, and who supervises the application of the rules.
The first issue to address is that of governance: how transparent is this organisation?
In other words, how transparent is its funding?
There are certainly hidden interests here.
The members of this committee, who are demanding transparency and always try to portray the market as transparent, should make at least a modicum of effort to comply themselves with the transparency requirements they lay down for the market!
My impression so far is that this organisation fights with every means at its disposal to avoid transparency in any form.
Who takes the decisions about financing and the choice of personnel for specific posts?
Why are individuals appointed?
Is it about regional balance?
Is it about inter-sector balance?
The current project concerns IFRS for small and medium-sized companies, so it is fair to ask who represents small and medium-sized companies.
Who knows about small and medium-sized companies?
And another thing: why are IFRS for small and medium-sized companies actually on the agenda right now?
Who sets the agenda?
Commissioner McCreevy and Sir David Tweedie have also been asked many times, over a number of years, why we are actually doing this.
Several years down the line we now know why we are discussing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies in Europe: it is because of requests from South Africa and Brazil.
What a marvellous answer!
We know quite well that the focus of all this is not South Africa or Brazil, but rather the European market, where there will be a lot of money to be made if SMEs are required to introduce something like this.
So these are the issues at stake in the matter of governance - and some initial, positive steps have been taken.
But all the bodies that are to be set up in the future will be assessed according to whether the people who belong to this supervisory organisation and have to answer questions about it at political level - and they could include a Member of the Commission - will also have the power to shape new developments.
It is not enough for them simply to be notified of proposals.
One of our aims is convergence.
We must take care, however, that the interpretation of convergence does not slip from Europe's grasp, to be replaced by the SEC's interpretation.
In Europe today we are sufficiently familiar with the way the US stock exchange is supervised.
We should not be so naïve as to leave the business of supervision to the Americans.
What we want is therefore what we have already called for: IFRS as Europe understands them and not as this board dictates.
Small and medium-sized companies are the ones affected here, and I have to say, without mincing my words, that the ideas on the table today are too complicated and too difficult.
I would also warn against taking the voluntary approach.
I am wearing my Bavarian national costume today and a good old Bavarian term comes to mind here: it is 'hinterfotzig' and it means something like 'through the back door'.
We know very well - despite all the denials and the acquiescence - that IFRS for small and medium-sized companies will be introduced to the European market through the back door, via a small number of Member States.
We will then hear the same voices calling for a single set of standards, and they will proceed to foist their standards on the market - standards which are too complex, which nobody understands and nobody wants - purely because there is a market opportunity.
What we have here is a case of a minority trying to impose its will on a majority at global level, and it is unacceptable!
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, for the considerable work that has gone into this comprehensive report.
It raises important issues for the future development of European and indeed global capital markets.
In this brief intervention I cannot address all the issues raised in the report.
Let me therefore focus on three points.
One, governance issues; secondly the EU's input to the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB; and thirdly the project to develop an accounting standard for small and medium-sized enterprises.
On IASB governance, your report rightly highlights the fact that our shared objective is to develop high-quality global accounting standards.
The EU's decision to require listed companies to use international accounting standards was a bold and visionary step towards this objective.
A single set of globally accepted accounting standards would provide significant benefits for our companies, our capital markets and our economy.
We must continuously strive to ensure that international accounting standards remain relevant in the face of changing economic circumstances and that they represent the interests of all stakeholders in a balanced manner.
To ensure that these conditions can continue to be met, progress should be made as a matter of priority in three areas.
Firstly, the accountability of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF), needs to be enhanced, in particular towards public authorities.
The latter should play an active role in the selection and appointment of trustees.
In this respect, the proposal that I, together with my counterparts in the US SEC, the Japanese FSA and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, made last November goes in the direction advocated by your report.
Secondly, we need to look at how the IASB's agenda-setting process can be improved.
In particular, the process through which priorities are set needs to be made more open and more transparent.
Thirdly, the IASB's due process should be enhanced, mainly by ensuring that standards are subject to a full impact assessment before they are adopted.
Your report makes constructive suggestions about these and related points.
The forthcoming review of the IASCF's constitution provides the opportunity to implement the necessary reforms.
The committee will pursue them in consultation with this House, the Member States and our international partners.
Now, turning to the EU's input to the IASB.
Your report argues that the EU needs to strengthen its capacity to make its views on accounting matters heard at the international level.
I agree.
In particular we should seek means to ensure that the views of European stakeholders, especially proactive input to the IASB's agenda-setting process, can be put to the IASB in a more timely and coherent manner.
I see this as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary process.
We should build on the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and I am ready to pursue this as a matter of urgency, including the possibility of using funding from the Community budget to support such a structure.
I must, however, sound a clear and unambiguous warning.
This structure will in no circumstances become an embryonic European standard-setter, nor can there be any question of developing European interpretations of international accounting standards.
Europe must and will remain part of the movement towards a single set of globally accepted accounting standards.
Anything else would damage the international competitiveness of our companies and our capital market.
Turning now to the IASB's project to develop an accounting standard for SMEs, let me begin by stating that the Commission currently has no legal basis to endorse this standard.
Moreover, we have never made any commitment to take over whatever standard the IASB produces.
We would only do so if we were genuinely convinced that the IASB produces a standard that meets the interests of European users.
The IASB has not yet finalised its project.
However, at this stage the Commission's views are clear.
The current exposure draft published by the IASB remains too complex to provide a satisfactory accounting framework for European SMEs, especially for smaller companies.
Our focus remains the simplification of the regulatory environment for SMEs, including in the accounting area.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the IAS system makes sense for big listed companies that operate worldwide.
That is why, during Parliament's last term, we decided, on the Legal Affairs Committee's proposal, to adopt the IAS Regulation.
The ultimate aim - as Alexander Radwan has said - was indeed to achieve convergence, at least with the USA and if possible worldwide.
The system makes no sense in the case of small and medium-sized companies because, as a rule, they have no need of international financial markets, no need of Wall Street and the rest.
For that reason alone, the necessity of developing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies is highly questionable.
On top of that - and I think Commissioner McCreevy was entirely right here - the current proposal is for nothing more than a slimmed-down version of what are, by any measure, extremely complicated international standards, entirely unsuited to the structure of small and medium-sized companies in Europe.
They are particularly ill-suited to family companies, which have been run by their owners for several generations; which have already written off property belonging to them; and in which the application of fair-value rules would simply encourage greed and, in the end, could very well jeopardise the companies' chances of survival.
On the other hand, we must be realistic.
Ultimately, the question of accounting standards for SMEs in Europe will not be exempt from some form of pressure for harmonisation.
Our demand is for comparability, at least within the Single Market.
So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London, with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too - but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term, rather than short-term valuation.
I have one further point to make about the IAS bodies.
There is a real problem here, as Alexander Radwan has outlined.
There may be a certain geographical balance but there is no balance in terms of economic weight.
Europe is by far the largest bloc, the largest region in which the IAS rules apply.
That is why we must have a commensurate say, and we simply cannot be compared with somewhere like Australia.
Australia carries the same weight as a middle-sized EU country or, indeed, a big region like North Rhine-Westphalia.
The balance needs to be improved in this respect.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, first of all my compliments to Mr Radwan on getting this thorough report completed.
It was under discussion up to the very last minute.
In its final form it is a report that is clear, but sometimes critical too.
The rapporteur is convinced that the IASB's democratic accountability has to be improved and I am glad to see the IASB taking this criticism on board.
The Chairman of the Trustees, Mr Gerrit Zalm, indicated recently in the European Parliament that he was open to suggestions and ready to put forward proposals on adapting the structure.
The IASB is working on IFRS standards for small and medium enterprises.
I agree with the rapporteur that IFRS are too complex and too expensive for SMEs.
I also believe that encouraging the voluntary use of IFRS by SMEs would carry the risk of them being introduced into Europe by the back door.
In my view there has to be differentiation according to company size.
It is a good thing to have big multinationals, banks and insurance companies which operate worldwide producing their annual accounts to a single standard.
But small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe should have their own standard.
The IASB has achieved much in respect of internationally listed companies and accounting standards for them.
If SMEs are now saying that cost and effort can be just as well managed using more than one standard, we cannot have a single standard being imposed from the top down.
It is also very important that the interests of investors and of transparency should be considered too.
Policy is there to facilitate, to ensure that there is sound, transparent and cost-effective information on business performance.
I think the proven benefits of IFRS can also benefit European equity markets, certainly if the Americans exchange their US GAAP system for IFRS.
Comparability here can be very beneficial to international investors and stakeholders.
The idea behind IFRS thus deserves to be supported by the European Parliament.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Thank you, Commissioner, for managing to come to Strasbourg.
Thank you also to the rapporteur, in your Bavarian costume.
I think we worked very well together, and the way in which it was possible for various people's amendments to be incorporated in your report is proof of that.
First of all, I should like to make three points about accounting standards.
It seems to me that, in terms of the governance and operation of the body responsible for setting these accounting standards, we are in an unusual situation.
There are many forms of standardisation.
Not all of them have such a strong impact on financial stability, or on the issues, in terms of power and governance, as accounting standards have.
What is happening today is an important event, a passage to adulthood.
When these accounting standards were formulated, perhaps by auditors who worked amongst themselves, they basically prepared the ground very well.
Nowadays these accounting standards are international.
They are used and applied by everyone and so the question of governance is crucial.
How does the body responsible for setting these accounting standards fit in with international governance, in relation to democratic bodies, bodies that legitimately represent State power, and the European Union in particular?
The second point we need to look at in regard to governance is of course the balance between those bodies.
What is the geographical balance, what is the balance in the representation not just of those who draw up the standards, but also of those who will have to use them?
The third point is financing.
How are these bodies to be financed?
Might the idea of a levy on businesses, which would be coordinated by regulatory bodies, be worthwhile?
Could they be financed by government, by the European Community?
We hope that the Commissioner will be making some strong proposals on that point.
The fourth question in regard to those bodies is the programme.
Is it right for them to develop the concept of fair value when we know the effects that can have on financial stability?
Is it right for this body to develop an SME programme that Europe does not need?
Is it right that, on this issue of standards for SMEs - just because, as our rapporteur has said, South Africa or Australia might need them - the Commissioner did not make sure that Europe had a say in those bodies.
It is absolutely essential, as a first step, that Europe should make sure it is there to represent the strength of all the Member States and the voice of Europeans, in the IASB, the IASCF and IFRIC.
Commissioner, that is your responsibility.
We are expecting strong proposals from you on that point.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, IFRSs are being adapted by more and more countries, so their value and importance is growing.
This brings with it a need to strengthen accountability and transparency of the IASB, which may not have been so obvious at its inception.
I welcome moves in that direction, but I regret that some parts of this report present criticism in a negative way, rather than acknowledging changes that are under way and pointing the way forward.
So several of my amendments aim to be more forward-looking, highlighting the advantages and benefits, alongside the need for further adaptation, both to the standards themselves and the IASB that oversees them.
However, unnecessary politicisation of technical issues must be avoided.
IFRSs are an important tool for advancing comparability across borders and reducing burdensome requirements for companies reporting under different regimes, but it would be useful if presentation of financial statements lent itself more easily to other comparison purposes.
However, it may well be the case that tools such as XBRL tagging can develop that.
I have to thank Ms van den Burg for organising an interesting presentation on that subject last week.
The SME proposals cause concern in several quarters.
To me they look more like a tool for medium entities, perhaps on their way to full public reporting, so they may merit their own separate consideration in that light or on a voluntary basis.
But - as you have said, Commissioner - as yet they are far too complex for the majority of ordinary SMEs.
Madam President, I commend my colleague Mr Radwan for a very well written report.
I hope the Bavarian national dress he is wearing here this morning is not indicative of a change in political direction.
The adoption of the IFRSs in January 2005 has brought great benefits to the European Union by making accountancy requirements simpler across borders and financial statements easier to compare across countries, competitors and industries, enhancing the work of regulatory oversight, banking and capital markets.
International financial reporting standards are now being used or are being adopted in more than a hundred countries, including Australia, South Africa and others.
I support the calls for increased transparency, effectiveness and accountability over the IASB.
The report points to the fact that 17 months had passed before the IASB appointed a new chairperson.
This cannot be acceptable.
The IASB is a private, self-regulatory body which has been given the role of rule-maker and it is only right that we demand increased accountability and oversight because of that.
We should also be careful about calling for the establishment of extra EU structures to deal with the interpretation and application of IFRS standards.
Why is it needed?
What will it do?
On the subject of EU-US convergence, there has been great progress made in this area and in the EU-US accounting road map.
Last year, the US President, the President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the European Commission signed a joint EU-US statement which undertook to promote and to seek to ensure conditions for the US generally accepted accounting principles and the IFRSs to be recognised in both jurisdictions.
This is very welcome.
With regard to the application of the IFRSs to SMEs, SMEs are small and smaller.
I feel it might be better to make it optional so as to ensure flexibility, rather than prevent its application outright.
(NL) Madam President, I must echo the compliments paid to Mr Radwan, not least because his report has enabled us to have a very interesting debate on the conflicts between legislation and self-regulation, especially at world level.
I appreciate that our aspirations place us in a quandary.
On the one hand we want these international standards, applicable worldwide, but on the other hand we insist on our authority as co-legislator to judge the substance of those standards and to discharge our duty as co-legislator responsibly.
I think the European Parliament has shown latterly that it does that.
To my mind the key lies in timely consultation, in a balanced consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, including third-party interests of employees, local authorities, suppliers and so on (because adequate financial reporting benefits more than just money providers alone), and a sound assessment of the consequences.
The Commission has a weighty responsibility here.
And in the immediate future these things must be done on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises.
We can make this a really worthwhile project for the EU.
Lastly, I have two comments which are also relevant to another report which we shall be voting on in our next part-session, Mr Lehne's report on a simplified business environment for companies.
Here too I have taken the line that rules are not just for companies, money providers and the accountants who earn their living from them, but also for employees and other groups.
So we must not meddle with the quality of the rules.
I have advocated that the rules should in any event be applied to delisted companies and off-balance activities.
I hope you will agree that there is also work for the IASB to do in that area.
I will end by repeating my heartfelt endorsement of the XBRL standard.
As you are aware, the US SEC is about to take a decision making this mandatory.
I urge you to think about how Europe should respond to this, and encourage you to draw up a roadmap for Europe accordingly.
Madam President, there are issues with the transparency and governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), but it has accepted this criticism and acknowledged the need to change.
Steps have been taken and more are planned: publication of feedback statements, explaining the reasoning behind its decisions, pushing cost-benefit analyses and enlargement and more active involvement of the board of trustees.
It bent over backwards to communicate with Parliament.
Mr Radwan's report is much improved from earlier versions and I believe the positive amendments from the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups will further improve the text today.
I would like to thank the rapporteur because, although we have had our differences, he was willing to compromise in certain areas on this governance aspect.
Unfortunately, I am unable to agree with him on the issue of International Financial Reporting Standards for SMEs.
The IASB was asked to draw up a simplified version for SMEs.
Mr Radwan's report declines to acknowledge that this could also be useful in the European Union.
In fact, with the proposal still only at the drafting stage, the report proclaims that it will definitely not benefit EU companies.
Yet we have been told repeatedly that it will be optional and is designed for those growing SMEs which aim to become public listed companies.
Small enterprises with no aspirations beyond their local markets need not take it up.
An opinion survey last September found that a clear majority of European SMEs, including German SMEs, considered the benefits outweighed any disadvantages and would improve financial reporting.
The efforts of the IASB to develop global accounting standards of a high quality are a major and welcome contribution to the European and world economies and, frankly, I think we should be applauding them.
(ES) Madam President, the requirement since 2005 for publicly traded companies to use the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) for their consolidated financial statements has been a wide-ranging and hugely influential political initiative.
About 100 countries are using the standards and their globalisation has provided comparability and transparency, thereby increasing the confidence of operators, creating a more level playing field and strengthening market discipline.
The proposal contains two great challenges relating to governance.
On the one hand, the private entity, which has been setting worldwide voluntary standards since 1973 on a corporate and professional basis, now finds itself in a position of huge responsibility entailing a change in its nature, procedures and composition in order that it can become a transparent, controllable institution, with a legitimacy reflecting its new role.
It is necessary to recognise and coordinate the activities of all the public and private interests concerned and at the same time to secure the organisation's financing and independence in the setting of standards.
Furthermore, the organisation must be integrated into international governance.
It is also necessary to strengthen European accounting governance by adopting a more proactive and integrated approach to the preparation, approval, implementation and assessment of standards.
It is vital to improve the conceptual framework of standards, and to bear in mind that they are neither neutral nor academic and can produce both winners and losers.
Likewise it is important to assess their effects and ensure their compatibility with European strategy, to learn from financial upheavals and to regulate the accounting standards of administrative concessions in a balanced way.
The financial accounting arrangements for SMEs will need to be simple and be linked to their exploitation of the internal and global market.
These matters are covered by Mr Radwan's report, which has achieved broad consensus and comes at a very opportune moment in terms of the upcoming review at the end of 2009, envisaging the creation of a supervisory body and altering the composition of the Standards Advisory Council before next year.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Radwan, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report and this debate because I think we are probing some really sensitive issues, and we are doing so on a genuinely cross-party basis.
Several points emerge very clearly from what has been said.
Firstly, we need a single set of standards for public limited companies, but we do not want to lump all companies together.
Secondly, while we are not rejecting specific rules tailored to SMEs, the framework for those rules must be established by us, by the European Union.
Thirdly, the measures currently proposed are too complex and too expensive, they are of no use to SMEs and for those reasons we must reject them.
Fourthly, we are still awaiting satisfactory answers to the questions of who makes what rules for whom, and who supervises the process.
There is no democratic legitimacy; there is no differentiation of approach; no account has been taken of the justifiable wishes of SMEs; and the system of democratic supervision is inadequate.
Fifthly, in taking a stance on this issue or trying to answer these questions, it is often forgotten that two-thirds of the workforce are employed in the private sector in family-owned companies, and the majority of those family-owned companies are SMEs that do not seek finance from the capital markets.
This is a point we need to remember when we are confronted with proposals that would treat all companies alike.
Thank you for this worthwhile debate!
Madam President, paragraph 30 of our motion for a resolution points out that financial statements do not simply serve the needs of investors but also other stakeholders.
As we also draw attention to the need for EU law changes in paragraph 41, I rise to remind the Commissioner that this Parliament has voted that any changes to the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives should include a requirement for social and environmental reporting by companies.
I draw to his attention such requirements in South Africa, in France's law on new economic regulations, as well as the recommendations of the Prince of Wales's Accounting for Sustainability project from my own country, the UK.
In the mean time, and in addition, I would like to ask the Commissioner, following the 2001 Commission recommendation on environmental issues in our new accounts, whether the Commission could issue a similar recommendation on social issues in accounts.
I would also like to ask the Commissioner to press the International Accounting Standards Board to include social and environmental aspects in its planned publication of a management commentary.
The Commission may or may not want to call this corporate social responsibility, but perhaps today we can all agree to call it accounting for responsible companies.
(ES) Madam President, the recent financial crises have shown the importance of high-quality accounting standards for the proper functioning of the markets.
This being the case, it seems to me that another lesson of the crisis is that there is a certain asymmetry between the stated importance of accounting standards and the nature and operation of the private entities responsible for setting, producing and interpreting those standards.
Mr Radwan's report is therefore correct to point out that the first matter to be dealt with is that of governance.
In my view he has put forward intelligent and realistic proposals about the need for the institutions representing the Union to be more proactive in this process of setting standards which are to be incorporated into the Community legal order, also concerning the internal operating rules of those private entities.
Greater transparency, safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and broader geographical representation are some of the proposals which Mr Radwan has put forward.
The second aspect dealt with in the report is the matter of small and medium-sized undertakings.
We have emphasised here in the House the need to reconcile two objectives: simplification and reduced cost of accounting procedures for SMEs and the provision of adequate information for market players.
The last point covered by Mr Radwan - and one with which I concur - is the need for global standards in a global environment.
Therefore it is extremely important to reach agreements with the other major world financial markets, notably the United States.
This calls for greater dynamism and a more significant role for the European institutions, including this Parliament and all those listening today.
(DE) Madam President, I can entirely endorse what our colleague has just said.
The underlying premise here - and Mr Radwan pinpoints it in his report - is that an institution without a political mandate should nonetheless lay down a relatively large body of measures affecting the economy, some of which are binding.
It is not enough to call for improved governance, or better framework conditions; political bodies also need to become more involved in this matter than they have been in the past.
What we are doing here in Parliament constitutes a step in the right direction, but further steps must be taken.
There is also another aspect to consider.
What is done here at the level of a regional organisation - in this case the European Union - should also be mirrored in the global context.
So it is not a simply a matter of seeking to apply these rules to our region of the world alone.
(LT) Madam President, as my colleague has already mentioned, this report deals with who is responsible for what in the accountability process.
Parliament's role is quite significant, and I believe that we should have this function too.
However, I would like to express some doubt regarding the consideration of every technical detail and establishing standards.
I do not find the description of the method of assessment and evaluation of realisable and non-realisable assets completely acceptable.
That is why I doubt we should interfere, whether this is good or a bad method.
We should wait for the experts to carry out the assessment.
Meanwhile, the review of the standard of non-realisable assets and consultations on this issue has already started.
Only then should we make our decision.
I therefore suggest that we do not support the proposal in Article 30(e) or that in Article 42.
Madam President, could I have assurances from Commissioner McCreevy that the single set of global accounting standards - with the consequent drive for increased standardisation of procedures - will in no way increase the justification, or even the requirement, for an EU common consolidated corporation tax base?
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Members for their comments.
It was certainly a very wide-ranging debate with diversity of views on many of the issues and we have taken note of them.
I would like to emphasise again that high-quality international accounting standards are crucial for the effective functioning of both the European and global capital markets.
The process through which these standards are developed should therefore be subject to robust governance.
It should be characterised by a high level of transparency and it should ensure a balanced consideration of stakeholder interests.
The IASCF and the IASB have over recent years implemented significant reforms of their internal procedures but I cannot deny that further improvements are necessary.
Moreover, I recognise that we in Europe should better organise ourselves to guide and provide input to the IASB standard-setting process.
In short, even if the IASB's governance and due process were perfect, international accounting standards will only meet the needs of European stakeholders if their views are presented in a coherent, a convincing and a timely manner.
Nearly all speakers referred to the question of IFRSs for SMEs and I repeat again that there is no legal basis for its endorsement in Europe at present.
If we were to do so, it would need codecision with the European Parliament.
Can I just repeat, as I have said many times about IFRSs for SMEs, when the IASB was going about this particular work I made it quite clear in a number of speeches that they should not assume that there was going to be automatic endorsement from the EU for this particular project.
We would only recommend it if it was simple and effective and met the needs of SMEs.
They were told that when they were doing their work.
Their first exposure draft has been presented.
I then took the opportunity of telling them that it did not meet those criteria and in the present state of affairs I could not possibly even consider recommending it for SMEs because it was neither simple nor effective.
That remains my position but, in line with what others have said and Mr Purvis in particular, it would probably be a good thing if there was a simple effective IFRS for SMEs - but only on that particular basis.
The idea is a good one.
I do not want to knock the idea at all, but I am not going to endorse now or in the future anything for SMEs that is just more complex and which no one understands.
It is not needed.
I take this opportunity of repeating again in Parliament what I have said on many occasions about this.
Ms van den Burg mentioned the question of XBRL.
We are working with the securities regulator to get consensus on the technical standards for business data and as a result of this dialogue the Commission may take further measures aiming at interoperability of regulatory information systems.
XBRL could allow investors to take full advantage of IFRS.
Any steps towards requiring the use of XBRL in the European Union should be subject to a thorough impact analysis, including the economic assessment of costs and benefits.
I have also discussed the matter with the SEC Chairman, Mr Chris Cox, during my recent visit to the United States and I support keeping this agenda point in our regulatory dialogue with the US authorities for the future.
These standards will need to be internationally accepted, technologically independent and interoperable.
It is a very exciting development and I know Ms van den Burg has recently had exposure to all this.
I took the same opportunity myself some months ago - getting experts to show me how it actually works.
I think it is something that is quite revolutionary and something to be welcomed, but we will not do anything about it just yet until we have done other work.
Mr Mitchell made an interesting point.
I think the importance of what he said was that we do not want the IASB to come and say 'an EU body or any other body'.
We want to be an internationally accepted body - because this goal is well worth pursuing - and it needs to be an independent body.
I think that should be taken as read, but with proper input from the various stakeholders.
May I remind everybody in the European Union that it was the EU which gave the IASB such importance.
We were the largest jurisdiction to say as from 2005 that the IFRS would become the rule for listed companies.
It was some years ago that this decision was made, together with the European Parliament, and that in itself gave greater importance to the IASB and to the process.
I would say - and I have said this repeatedly to the IASB also - that road testing - you can call it impact analysis - should be done before standards are adopted, particularly by the IASB, and with input from the EU and other bodies as well.
We should not be waiting until the standards are endorsed by the IASB.
We had the job here of either agreeing to them or rejecting them.
We do not have the role of changing them.
I think that they should be road tested enough beforehand to see if there are going to be problems, rather than finding out about serious problems after the whole IASB process has been gone through.
We made this point repeatedly to the IASB.
Hopefully, I think the new governance structures have been appreciated by most of us.
I accept that more work needs to be done in this particular area but that will lead to fewer problems in the future.
Hopefully we will arrive some day at a situation where these things will be more or less automatic and not cause any great headaches for anybody because all the work will have been done previously.
We will not have difficulties then.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for this debate, in which the main thrust of the report has certainly received support and alternatives have been outlined in various areas.
I should like to pick up on two things.
There is one point on which I am sure we all agree, and it has been made repeatedly today by speakers who fully support this general development, namely that the IFRS organisation has now taken some action, for example on governance issues, as a result of the pressure applied by this House - by the European Parliament - and by the European Union.
There are times when we need to be quite blunt - and I am aware that some of my female colleagues have criticised me in that regard - because certain individuals who have appeared before this House in recent years have occasionally given the unmistakable impression that the European Parliament is of little interest to them.
How little progress there has been is clear from the proposal on governance, where it is suggested that the future supervisory bodies may take advice only from persons they have appointed.
All I can say is that anyone required in future to report to a parliament on how he or she voted on a particular point should make sure that a share of responsibility and a say in policy-making is part of the package.
That is the first point.
How little commitment there is on the matter of impact assessments is clear from current discussions, in which the IFRS organisation is still refusing to conduct them.
Turning to the question of standards for SMEs, I have something to say to all those who believe we should introduce them on a voluntary basis.
Inspired here by John Purvis - John, this is for you - I intend to quote an independent commentator.
Peter Holgate, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, writing in the German edition of the Financial Times, said the following:
'I don't take the European position all that seriously.
Even if they end up not endorsing it, various countries could adopt it in their national generally accepted accounting principles.
If a few major players do that you have it brought in by a different door even if the EC doesn't want to play ball.'
At the end of the day, this means you have to assume that, once a few states have adopted these standards, you will have them imposed on a compulsory basis throughout the European Union.
Such is the strategy of this organisation.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has already indicated that they see this as a business model.
That is why we need our own European set of standards for SMEs: we can build on the IFRS if that is appropriate but if it is not, then we will develop our own standards.
It is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that we do not have standards foisted on us through the back door, which nobody wants but which would then become generally binding.
The debate is closed.

(SL) I would like to comment on the remarks made at the beginning of voting when fellow members attempted to use the unplanned event at the Krško nuclear power station as an illustration of the unsafe performance of nuclear power plants.
I should point out that the event was indeed unplanned, that it involved a component failure, that the plant was not shut down but rather had its operations safely suspended, and that repairs on it are under way.
The operation of the power station is transparent and fellow members can find information on it on the website of the country's nuclear safety administration.
I should also add that by all performance indicators the Krško nuclear power station is one of the safest nuclear power plants in the world.

Revision of the framework directive on waste (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Caroline Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste and repealing certain Directives (11406/4/2007 - C6-0056/2008 -.
rapporteur. - Madam President, following your ruling that there is no time for points of order, I will continue with my speech on the Waste Framework Directive.
It is a little difficult to do so against this background, but I will persevere.
Since certain comments have been made on this point in the British press recently, may I begin by drawing attention once again to my declaration of interests, which I made on the record, and which cites my membership of the Environmental Advisory Board of Shanks plc.
That company operates a wide range of waste technologies in Britain and on the continent, and the primary purpose of its Environmental Advisory Board is to provide independent audits of the operation of its plants.
My fellow board members include the chairman of the EU Scientific Advisory Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and a member of the Green Alliance.
Like many Members, I value the opportunity this kind of experience has given me to learn at close hand about the issues and problems facing this industry and those who work in it.
Turning to the Directive, it has been a long and tortuous road to this second reading and I congratulate those of my colleagues who have accompanied me on it to the very end.
The issue is a very important one.
Various judgments in the Court of Justice regarding the status of waste destined for treatment in energy-from-waste plants needed to be clarified.
New definitions were needed.
Two existing directives on hazardous waste and on waste oils were repealed and their provisions transferred to the Waste Framework Directive.
However, the committee was not content with those original proposals, and went on to transform the Directive from a technical one into a campaigning one.
I congratulate my colleagues on that.
I have to say that the mood in the Council was very bleak, possibly mirroring our economic times.
There was much resistance to what we wanted to do and the Council drove a very hard bargain, but we achieved the following.
Firstly, we have added recycling targets to the text.
That is a very significant achievement since these were not in the original proposal, and this is the first time that recycling targets for household waste have appeared in EU legislation.
It is entirely due to Parliament that they are there.
The new Article 8a requires Member States to take the necessary measures designed to achieve an overall recycling rate of 50% by 2020 for paper, metal, plastic and glass from household and similar waste.
There are some Member States, such as Germany, for which this is a conservative target, but there are many for which it is very demanding, and we need to take them into account too.
The same article also requires that by 2020 70% of construction and demolition waste be recycled.
The Greens and their supporters are putting it about that the targets are not enforceable.
They may even believe that, but they are - extraordinarily - rejecting their own achievement.
The Commission has issued a statement to help them, and Mr Dimas will confirm this.
The statement says quite clearly that if in 2020 the targets are not achieved, this will be a serious indication for the Commission that a Member State has not taken the necessary measures designed to achieve the targets.
On this basis, supported by conclusions in the tri-annual national progress reports, the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive.
It may be important to the Greens not to be happy, because Greens are eternal campaigners, but they should take some account of what the Commission has said in that statement.
Secondly, we have added new provisions on the prevention of waste, in Article 8a.
These will mean that the Commission has to report on the evolution of EU waste generation and the scope for waste prevention by 2011, and by 2014 must produce proposals for waste prevention, and decoupling objectives for 2020.
It proved impossible to get the Council or the Commission to agree to quantitative waste prevention targets in this Directive, partly because the data necessary for those targets is missing, but Parliament has, through its amendments, created momentum for future policy that may contain waste prevention targets.
The new article therefore represents a significant achievement.
It is something for our successors to build on.
We cannot do everything in this Directive, but have to hand things on to our successors in the next decade.
Thirdly, we have firmly placed the famous EU waste hierarchy in EU law for the first time.
We have been talking about this for years, but if you look at EU law it is not there.
However, it will be soon, and we can celebrate a minor victory in getting the Council to agree that the hierarchy shall apply 'as a priority order' in waste prevention and management legislation.
Fourthly, we have secured agreement to place better emphasis on hazardous waste management, as several colleagues wanted.
Fifthly, we have also ensured that priority will continue to be given to the regeneration of waste oils - although there was no support for a policy, which I know some colleagues wanted, that would have made regeneration mandatory in all Member States.
We secured Council support for the amendment put forward by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and colleagues designed to make it easier for SMEs to use the waste list, and we also obtained support for a new article on biowaste.
In conclusion, the Directive specifies the energy efficiency criteria for incineration, with energy recovery to be classed as a recovery operation rather than disposal.
That is the best deal available.
Anyone who thinks that we could get anything better by going to conciliation would be deceiving themselves.
In the famous words of Jack Nicholson, 'this is as good as it gets'.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, on her excellent contribution to the revision of the Waste Framework Directive, and the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their positive and constructive contribution.
With this Directive, the Community is taking the first substantial step towards creating a recycling society.
The Directive introduces a modern approach to waste management, treating waste as useable raw materials and providing clearer definitions, simplified regulations, and new, ambitious targets.
Thanks to the incorporation of the provisions of the Directives on Hazardous Waste and Waste Oil, this Directive contributes to the broader effort in improving legislation and simplifying the acquis communautaire.
The next step, of course, will be its successful implementation.
Parliament's considerable efforts and perseverance have been rewarded.
It was not easy to persuade the Member States to accept the new recycling targets and agree to the waste prevention objectives.
Nevertheless, this aim has been achieved in full.
Some doubts have been expressed regarding whether these targets will be implemented by the Member States.
I should like to underline that with the current formulation of the quantitative targets, the Commission has the ability and the political will to refer Member States to the European Court of Justice if they have not taken the measures that are essential for achieving the recycling targets.
Parliament has incorporated many other significant points into the text of the Directive.
Among these are the hierarchy of five categories of waste, new provisions on the separate collection of biowaste and hazardous waste, and many useful clarifications.
These points enrich the Commission's original proposal and improve the text, so that it becomes an ambitious legislative instrument for future generations.
The fact that it has been possible to achieve agreement at second reading is, of course, particularly satisfying.
I should like to emphasise once more the European Parliament's constructive role in this process.
This Directive creates a new framework for waste management and provides a solid foundation for other Community policy initiatives.
The European Commission is in a position to support the compromise package in order to achieve agreement at second reading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Caroline Jackson referred to a quotation I think from Jack Nicholson.
Knowing her golfing prowess, I thought it might have been from Jack Nicklaus, but no doubt they would have had the same sort of quotation: 'This is about as good as it gets'.
That is a great tribute to our rapporteur and I salute her on behalf of our Group.
It is necessary that we support her and take action.
It is not as good as we might have envisaged it being at one point.
However, we have made enormous progress.
Commissioner, it is up to you now to ensure that it is implemented and to bring forward the subsequent provisions on prevention with your target of 2014.
I know you will put this process in motion and that is important too.
It is important because we have had a whole raft of waste proposals in my time in this Parliament: we have dealt with vehicles, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, packaging and so forth.
However, waste goes on rising; it rises faster than the growth of our economies.
It grows fastest in some areas like municipal waste, and that is why we need to take action.
My own country sets one of the worst examples in terms of waste.
The Netherlands we salute as setting the best example.
However, we all need to catch up.
We all need to have more recycling so as to meet the terms of the hierarchy: we need to meet the recycling targets and prevention targets and so forth.
I believe that this is a measure which will at least send us down that road in a better frame of mind than we have shown in the past with our wasteful economy, wasteful society and wasteful policies.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am helped by the fact that Mrs Jackson and Commissioner Dimas have given a full explanation of the main elements of this compromise, which I also support.
Let me therefore put forward some eminently political thoughts.
I am a negotiator and I always ponder whether or not the compromise that has been reached is valid.
I therefore read the texts again with a fresh mind, following the night of the negotiations.
Goodness only knows why negotiations always have to end at night.
Is an agreement reached in the morning of less value?
There is food for thought there as well.
In all sincerity - and I say this to our Green and GUE colleagues, and to Karl-Heinz Florenz who I see has re-tabled an amendment from the Environment Committee which bore my signature and which I cannot therefore but support - in all sincerity, looking at both the compromise and the Environment Committee texts, we have achieved - and the main credit goes to you, Mrs Jackson - a really amazing result.
Are we aware that there was nothing about recycling in the Commission proposal and then in the common position?
Nothing apart from a recital which mentioned the recycling society without going into further detail.
There was nothing!
Now we have precise targets; we have a review in 2014 when other materials, not covered at present, could be included; we know for sure, as Commissioner Dimas has just confirmed it, that legal action can be taken against States failing to implement the measures planned to achieve those targets.
That seems a very important fact to me.
It is also very important that a political and legal process has finally been set in motion to compel States to draw up genuine waste prevention plans, and that a hierarchy of waste disposal which respects the environment has finally been included in European law, and is legally binding, making waste no longer just a problem but a resource.
In all honesty, therefore, and shouldering our full responsibility, I believe that rejecting this compromise and heading for a risky conciliation would not be in the interest of European citizens, but would turn the achievement and establishment of these targets, set out here in a clear and absolutely incontrovertible way, into a kind of Russian roulette.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with this text we hope to reverse the trend of producing more waste than we recycle.
It is the result of several years of debates and taking account of the reality of two major groups of Member States as regards waste management systems: recycling states and landfilling states.
The achieved compromise must be seen in this light.
For the first time, prevention and recycling have been given a central role in the Directive.
Furthermore, the text includes the necessary dynamics to adapt higher targets as well as targets for new waste streams It is a carefully balanced compromise: achievable and realistic.
Amendments: we do not consider that in their entirety they endanger the general agreement.
With regard to by-products - the article in the body of the Directive and the article on end of waste - most critics fear sham recovery.
As the issue is not internationally agreed, the danger is real.
It must, therefore, be made clear that the Commission will use the guidelines from February 2007 in order to prevent this.
I would much appreciate it if Mr Dimas would give us today an assurance that a substance or object will be shipped as a by-product outside the Community only once the conditions of Article 4(1) are met in the Community.
Similarly for end of waste.
When certain waste ceases to be waste, the substance or object resulting from it can be shipped as such outside the Community only once the conditions of Article 5 are met in the Community.
It would make it easier for many MEPs to vote for the compromise.
To conclude, I wish to extend many thanks to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for fruitful cooperation to the benefit of the citizens of Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to thank Mrs Jackson.
We may have ended up in disagreement about the tax, but I think that there is no doubt that there has been excellent cooperation throughout the discussions.
We are not happy today - I wish we were - and I would like to give some of the reasons why we are not happy with the compromise.
We have supported 30 of the compromise amendments and we have tabled others to try and strengthen the compromise in the areas of hazardous waste, end of waste, by-products and separate collection of biowaste.
But from the very start, the main issues for us were the adoption of binding targets on waste reduction and recycling and opposition to the reclassification of incineration as energy recovery.
The final compromise does not have a legally binding target for waste reduction.
A study on waste prevention is no alternative to stabilisation measures; the continuous growth in waste is unsustainable and without this measure it will continue to grow.
Although recycling and reuse targets have been set at 50% and 70% and the Member States are legally obliged to put measures in place to achieve these targets, the targets themselves are not binding.
I am grateful for the explanation that we have had from Mr Dimas, but why was there such a debate over the wording of this?
The reason was to avoid making those targets binding.
Manufacturing and industrial waste, which have a huge potential for reuse and recycling, have been left out altogether.
Incineration cannot be viewed as a waste management option on a par with recycling and reuse; this will just attract further investment into incinerators and directly undermine the waste hierarchy.
If the weak compromise is adopted, we will have missed the opportunity to ensure real EU action and leadership on waste policy when we so desperately need it.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for her work.
We have worked well together to make some improvements to the original Commission proposal, although we do not agree on everything.
Many people throughout the Union will be concerned about the proposal to 're-brand' incinerators as a form of recovery if they meet certain efficiency criteria.
We remain opposed to the 're-branding' of incineration and have put down an amendment to have this deleted.
With regard to recycling, the latest proposed deal sets out targets which may be very difficult to enforce due to vagueness in the wording which states that, "member states shall take the necessary measures designed to achieve recycling targets.”
Good legislation demands that we be more precise in our wording on targets and do not leave interpretation to the European Court of Justice.
Therefore we want to defend and keep the wording as voted by the committee.
Proposals on waste prevention have weakened to the point where they will not be able to make a substantive enough contribution or to clearly help Member States in stabilising and reducing their waste.
The weakness of the reference to prevention targets means that a harmonised prevention initiative and indicators is not yet enshrined in legislation
Therefore, we can be cosignatories to some of the work we have done together.
However, regarding other parts of it, we believe that we must table amendments.
I would like, once again, to thank Mrs Jackson for the open and inclusive way she corresponded with the shadow raporteurs.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has produced a very good report as a recommendation for second reading.
I am thinking in particular of the prominent place given to the waste hierarchy, the scrapping of the by-products category, the careful handling of the end-of-waste concept, the protection rules on hazardous waste and the prevention, reuse and recycling objectives.
The only negative aspect of the report by the Committee on the Environment was the amendment to encourage waste incineration by regarding it as efficient use if enough energy is recovered.
In the negotiating result achieved after two months, not all that much remained of the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment and that was due not to the rapporteur, but to the uncompromising position of the Council.
The article on by-products was not amended and Member States can decide on their own initiative when waste ceases to be waste, with all the disruption to competition that that entails.
Furthermore, no prevention objectives have been set and the reuse and recycling objectives are considerably weakened.
It was for those reasons that I did not support the compromise package.
However, I hope that we still adopt the better parts of the Committee on the Environment report when we vote tomorrow.
I am referring in particular to the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group and the Greens.
The environment deserves that we go through a further mediation procedure to that end, in which we actually get the Council to make the necessary improvements.
If we, as a Parliament, are convincing, it should be possible, with the leadership of Mrs Jackson, to do more than is the case at present.
I should like to thank Mrs Jackson and the other shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and I hope we shall see a successful outcome from the vote tomorrow.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support all the amendments intended to introduce targets which are indispensable for prevention with a view to improved recycling.
Naturally, I also support the insistence on a clearly defined and clearly structured waste hierarchy.
It is also indispensable to be able to draw on sound and comparable statistical data if further progress is to be made as regards both prevention and recycling of industrial waste.
Ladies and gentlemen, I consider that we in Parliament must staunchly support the application of the hierarchy principle as a general rule, and not as a guiding principle as preferred by the Council.
The directive must clarify in detail the criteria to be used for any departures which, in my view, must where necessary be framed in an ordered and distinct way, so that there can be no doubt about what is considered as recovery and what is considered as disposal of waste.
I agree with the rapporteur that energy from waste plants can play an important part in dealing with residual waste and that we are now faced with an important choice in this respect, bearing in mind the European Union's dependence on insecure imports of energy from so many other parts of the world.
I would conclude by saying that I also welcome the amendments relating to the regeneration of waste oils, which had initially been taken out.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, may I say to Caroline Jackson that I am unhappy with the compromise, but that is not because of any flaw in Mrs Jackson's negotiating skills.
On this occasion, I have to say to Stavros Dimas that my displeasure is directed at the Commission for a change.
In the case of aircraft, industry and motor vehicles, the Commission is extremely strict, haggling for every gramm by which it can reduce CO2 emissions, and rightly so.
In the case of waste-management policy, however, CO2 does not enter the equation at all.
The evidence points to a potential cut of 100 million tonnes of CO2.
That is a golden opportunity, but it has been squandered in this document.
My second cause for regret is that we have become a kind of concreting firm.
We concrete over the divergences in Europe instead of aiming for harmonisation.
Although we define targets, they are not binding.
Over the next 20 years we shall not obtain any genuine harmonised targets in Europe.
That is what disturbs me about this report.
Twenty years is almost half a generation.
We ought to have been far more innovative, and we could have been.
I believe, Commissioner, there is only one major problem, namely Article 14.
I would be delighted if you could say some more about that provision.
In a federal state, it may be a highly complex matter.
It is about the question of mixed or unmixed waste management and how it is dealt with in accordance with the principle of self-sufficiency.
I beg you earnestly to comment on this matter again in your concluding explanations.
At the present time, of course, one or two people are saying that we shall secure a large majority, but, if these questions are not resolved, some of the large countries will undoubtedly agonise over their vote.
Please consider that we do not only have tomorrow's reading; we have a third reading too, and 64 amendments on the table are quite a lot for a conciliation procedure.
So if you take the opportunity, Commissioner, to explain one or two things about these unresolved issues, I could imagine that we might reach a successful outcome.
Madam President, in Europe we are currently recycling only 27% of our waste and almost half of our waste ends up in landfills.
This shows that we have to fundamentally change our waste management.
Most importantly we should encourage waste prevention, strengthen reuse and recycling and minimise the amount of landfill waste.
Therefore I welcome the fact that the waste hierarchy remained in the new compromise text after some debate.
As regards prevention - the main aim of the legislation - I miss the waste stabilisation targets in the latest text, but we had already adopted them in the first reading.
In the old Member States one person generates almost twice as much household waste - 570 kg per year - as a person in the new Member States - 300 to 350 kg per year.
So the rich nations should start to decrease waste production first.
The amount of generated waste is increasing on a European scale.
Therefore prevention programmes, as proposed in the compromise, are not enough: we must set binding targets to halt the growing waste generation.
I welcome the mandatory waste reuse and recycling targets, but I am afraid that the new text, which says that Member States 'shall take the necessary measures' to achieve the targets is not enough.
We need concrete, enforceable and binding targets, both for household and industrial waste.
Therefore I propose to support Amendment 82, to ensure the enforcement of the recycling targets.
Having made these comments, I welcome the report and the work of Mrs Jackson, my friend Guido Sacconi and others.
Madam President, this agreement is as good as it gets, the rapporteur says, and I pay credit to what she has achieved.
There are gains to be made at 3 o'clock in the morning during a conciliation session that cannot be achieved at other times during the negotiating process.
We all recognise that the size of our waste mountain needs to be reduced.
One British supermarket has recently announced that by 2012 it intends to reduce the use of packaging by 25% and its use of carrier bags by 33%.
It wants to ensure that waste food is converted to energy by anaerobic digestion.
It wants to restrict the number of materials used in packaging to just four which are easy to recycle or compost and it wants to print simple symbols on all packaging to make it easy for customers to recycle or compost their waste.
Now all this is a matter of political will.
Reducing waste is a matter of political will and that will can be strengthened by European Union law.
I suspect that we could have got the Council to at least agree to bring forward the date by which it will publish proposals for waste reduction from 2014 to a few years earlier.
Parliament has done well.
It could, perhaps, have done better.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is a disappointment.
It is nothing short of a failure to meet the need for more efforts to tackle climate change and conserve resources.
We know that the European Environment Agency has predicted a 50% increase in the volume of waste by 2020.
In this respect, the fact that binding stabilisation levels or binding recycling targets have not been prescribed represents a flop, a caving-in to pressure from the Member States.
The instrument that was needed has unquestionably been watered down in response to that pressure.
It is also disappointing that waste incineration is increasingly becoming the ultima ratio at the expense of waste avoidance.
It was precisely to redress this imbalance that these recycling quotas and the stabilisation of waste volumes would have served.
I hope that, by adopting amendments, we can still make some improvements to this draft and actually do what is necessary, namely to formulate the sort of ambitious waste-management policy we need in the European Union.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but I have to criticise some of the compromises reached as, in some cases, they run the risk of undermining what Parliament very rightly voted for at first reading.
I am also sorry because these changes for the worse have been imposed by the Council and are mistaken and dangerous.
I say this from my own standpoint, living, as I do, in Italy.
In this case, Italy unfortunately offers a bad example of waste management, failing to respect the spirit and the letter of European law under which a virtuous hierarchy, ranging from reduction to recycling, has for some time been consolidated.
That hierarchy has to be strengthened by quantified and certain targets - for reduction and recycling - for industrial waste as well, and not weakened, as is to some extent the case, by leaving scope for disposal policies which undermine its philosophy.
Italy has, for instance, offered billions of euro in incentives for waste incineration in recent years, with results that are evident to all and can in no way be seen as positive.
Madam President, across Europe, every Member State is struggling with runaway energy prices.
Therefore seeing waste as potentially important fuel is, I believe, both sensible and necessary.
It is surely a win-win situation - both dealing with our massive stockpiles of waste and providing an alternative energy supply source, particularly as we face an energy crisis and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign supplies of oil.
I therefore do not therefore understand the reticence of some in facing up to the obvious advantage of promoting energy from waste.
I fear some colleagues feel so precious about their recycling and anti-incineration dogmas that they would sacrifice the opportunity of heat and power from waste.
In that, I have to say, I believe they are profoundly mistaken.
On a related note, could I say that I very strongly favour maximising the definition of 'recovery' under the Directive, making it indisputably clear that energy from waste represents recovery, not disposal, of waste.
We should particularly apply that to our agricultural sector, where there is much opportunity in that regard.
(FR) Madam President, first I want to offer warm thanks to our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, for the remarkable job she has done, which reflects the quality of her expertise on the delicate issue of waste management.
I also congratulate her on listening so attentively, which she has done throughout the negotiations, and thanks to which we have achieved this difficult compromise with the Council and the Commission.
We have a new directive that endeavours to clarify a number of points.
We welcome the waste management and hierarchy and the ambitious recycling targets set for the Member States - 50% for household waste by the year 2020.
Waste management must be based on prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery and, lastly, disposal, and this hierarchy must be a guiding principle.
It is also important for incinerators to be subject to energy efficiency criteria, as set out in the text, provided of course that incineration is used only when no other method is feasible.
On that basis, I regard it as very positive that the text also provides for very tight controls on hazardous waste and more stringent traceability measures.
This is, of course, a compromise and we would have wished to go much further on certain points, such as adding environmental criteria in the definition of recovery and setting more stringent conditions for departures from the status of waste; then there is the issue of by-products, where the definition poses some problems.
Nonetheless, we absolutely must support this compromise because we know full well that it was difficult to reach and that if we want to go to conciliation we would be taking the risk of defeat and delaying matters hugely.
We must realise that since our European waste policy has been a failure to date, it is far preferable to agree a solution that seems reasonable, and the European Commission must be very vigilant in ensuring that this directive is implemented properly.
We will see if we can go further in a few years' time.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for my part I am not satisfied with either the form or the substance of this compromise text.
On the form, I believe we cannot do our job properly when, after spending two years working on drawing up a text, we find that the final decisions - which are more than just adjustments - are taken on the quiet and go far beyond what was adopted in the Committee on the Environment and only land on Members' desks a few hours before the vote.
On the substance, this compromise text is a cop-out that fails to give a clear definition of recovery, no longer tries to stabilise the volume of waste, no longer sets out ambitious recycling targets and unfortunately reflects the inability of the Commission and the Council to translate the highly ambitious declarations made at European and international level into actions.
No, I am not satisfied, and I am in fact concerned at our political incapacity to take genuine environmental action or action to improve our health, which is also why I have voted against the text.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to pay tribute to the work done by our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, and by Mojka Drčar Murko, rapporteur for our ALDE Group.
The question of hazardous waste raises vital issues of traceability, non-dilution, homogeneous storing of information on waste movement over a long period, i.e. five years for all parts of the chain; yet all those issues have been treated rather lightly.
That is more than regrettable in terms of health and the environment.
In regard to by-products, I am most disappointed.
I am not against the concept of by-products: on the contrary, I recognise their importance; but I do feel that the definition given in the Council's common position does not offer enough guarantees and that at the end of the day it risks destroying the very concept as a result of the possible abuses.
Other questions, such as the status of end of waste and the recovery of waste, seem to me to have been sacrificed in the name of an agreement at second reading.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jackson, we shall be tabling a cross-party amendment that attracted majority support in this House at first reading.
It addresses the following problem: in many countries of the EU untreated, unsterilised food scraps are repeatedly fed to livestock or fly-tipped.
Time and again, this kind of behaviour poses the risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease.
It is therefore essential to ensure that food waste is sterilised and safely disposed of by approved companies using suitable methods.
Member States should only be allowed to authorise its use in pig feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133°C and a pressure of 3 bar and if all other requirements of Regulation 1774/2002 have been met in full.
I firmly believe that, if Parliament adopts this amendment, the Council will incorporate this rule into the compromise.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise that has been reached is a retrograde step from the text approved by the Committee on the Environment.
The original text said that waste production should be reduced to 2009 levels from 2012, introducing a genuine policy of prevention with measures staggered over time.
That objective has been rescinded in the compromise, leaving everything vague.
The Committee on the Environment had set minimum targets for the recycling of domestic and industrial waste, to be achieved by set - albeit far-off - deadlines.
Those targets have also been watered down, limiting them solely to some types of material and excluding industrial waste.
Another negative aspect is the promotion of incinerators over a certain efficiency from disposal plant to recovery plant.
This directive seems to be giving in to what powerful lobbies want.
The outcome of the Irish referendum has shown that you are either on the side of citizens and their concerns, or you run of risk of rejection of the idea of Europe and paralysis of the integration process.
Parliament must take heed of the thousands of emails from European citizens calling for greater commitments and binding targets, otherwise we risk losing another major opportunity to enhance the credibility of the European institutions.
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
I welcome the compromise package, but at the same time I would like to emphasise that the compromise is a rather fragile one.
It is therefore vitally important that each of the Member States behaves responsibly and does not go looking for any loopholes that might have remained in the legislation.
In Hungary at present, separate collection of waste accounts for 2% of the total.
In my view, there is nothing more to say about this other than to express the hope that the impact of the Directive will finally help to shift the situation forwards from this low position.
In the eastern half of Europe, investment in waste management has increased in recent years, largely thanks to funding obtained from the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) and the Cohesion Fund.
Construction of landfill sites has been a major activity, but in a number of communities waste separation programmes have been initiated, including measures aimed at separate collection of organic waste in some instances.
On the other hand, genuine measures and investment aimed at waste reduction have not been forthcoming at all, and a distinct industry for processing recyclable materials has yet to emerge.
The nature of the guidelines set out by the European Union will therefore be crucial, not least for Hungary.
According to the statistics, every community could basically achieve a 50% reduction in the waste it produces as soon as it introduces dry waste recycling and separate door-to-door collection of organic waste.
When setting out the new obligations, however, we must also consider their enforceability and associated costs.
For example, can the additional investments be put in place in the same areas as the ISPA projects?
Can the original contracts be amended?
If not, then it makes little difference whether demand exists to expand waste separation or whether legislation is in place to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill; under the twenty-year contracts the waste collected must be taken to the landfill sites that have been constructed.
In addition to approving this directive, therefore, we must not delay in getting to work on potential ways of amending the existing contracts.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her outstanding work.
Thank you very much.
(DE) Madam President, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur.
She has certainly managed to achieve an acceptable outcome with the Council.
I particularly wish to emphasise the inclusion of the divergent waste hierarchy.
There are, however, minus points, which are truly incomprehensible and which were put into this document by the Council.
The first of these relates to animal by-products.
We had established in committee that animal by-products would be dropped from this framework waste directive.
What the Council has now done is to erect the sort of bureaucratic obstacle that drives farmers to the barricades.
It lays down that slurry processed into biogas suddenly becomes a waste product.
Do you know what this means?
It means that farmers will need a waste-treatment licence and will have to specify the precise volume and nature of the waste to be treated and the place of treatment.
The Animal By-products Regulation lays down explicitly that exceptions apply to slurry.
It would now therefore be easier for a farmer to spread slurry on his fields than to process it into biogas.
In other words, we are creating bureaucratic obstacles to a practice we actually seek to encourage.
The second point concerns waste oil.
The Waste Oil Directive - which, as you know, is now to be repealed - stipulates that waste oils are to be treated and regenerated.
There are large volumes being processed under that directive.
It has already been established, of course, that waste oils need not be treated in cases where regeneration is not economically viable or technically possible.
It has now been laid down that the Member States are to decide.
Well, are we now a European Union or have we reverted to a collection of Member States?
The fact is that we are quite clearly breaking up the market again.
I find that very disquieting.
Let me move on to the question of increased self-sufficiency.
Local authorities will now determine who may dispose of what and when.
Needless to say, there was a great deal of pressure from local authorities with spare incineration capacity.
That, however, is the wrong way to go.
It is not an option, and this extension is causing the market economy to grind to a complete halt in the realm of waste management.
(NL) Madam President, I think it is clear that this compromise is an important step forward for European environmental law.
All the same, I am not entirely happy with the compromise.
Why not?
My own region, Flanders, along with, for instance, the Netherlands, has the best waste policy and is excellent at sorting and recycling, so we find the proposed recycling and prevention targets totally inadequate.
It really does not give us any encouragement at all to do better in the future.
We are also not entirely happy about the possibility of household waste incinerators being regarded as an efficient use on the basis of the energy efficiency formula, which we believe might, in practice, create a great deal of confusion.
All the same, I am certain that the overall result has to be seen as very positive and I therefore want to thank Mrs Jackson sincerely for her huge contribution.
We shall be supporting the compromise.
(HU) Madam President, in its present form, unfortunately, the Waste Framework Directive threatens the expansion of biogas use.
I completely agree with our fellow Member Mr Schnellhardt from the PPE-DE Group that the present directive is inadequate with regard to biogas production, as also with regard to the use of slurry or municipal waste.
In its present form, unfortunately, the Waste Directive will jeopardise expansion of biogas use.
This calls the Jackson report into question.
Within the framework of the Waste Directive, the definition of animal manure used for biogas production as waste is ambiguous.
If the scope of the directive were to include this, it would make it impossible to produce biogas from animal manure, despite the fact that this would have major advantages from the point of view of energy management, the environment and climate protection.
We must clear up this muddle and restore legislative consistency as soon as possible, and therefore we must adopt the Commission's position on the directive as regards biogas.
(PL) Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur on a realistic appraisal of the growing waste problem.
The basic assumptions in the proposed regulations are waste prevention and material recycling.
Recovery of energy is simpler, but it should not replace material recycling, which is more difficult.
For this reason it is necessary to create the conditions to enable material recycling to take place and to make more precise legal distinctions describing, for example, when scrap metal does not constitute waste, but becomes a raw material.
We need better and cheaper material recycling technologies.
Products should be designed in such a way as to simplify recycling.
Selective collections are needed and these need to be adapted to the market in such a way that both households and potential users of secondary materials can benefit.
Without these solutions we face the risk of a repeat of the present situation in Naples, where, unfortunately, the incineration of waste may turn out to be the only option.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this debate for their positive contributions.
On the basis of the agreed text, Member States will now have to take a number of measures in order to improve their waste management.
The Directive lays down clear definitions and waste management principles, which I trust will resolve the existing interpretation problems, reduce the number of court cases and set a sound legal basis for the functioning of the waste treatment sector.
A number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed.
The most important are these.
Firstly, the environmental objective of the Directive is now clear and ambitious.
The level of environmental protection has not only been maintained but also strengthened in several cases, such as hazardous waste.
The co-legislators have agreed on a number of cornerstone definitions, including definitions of waste, prevention, recycling and recovery.
These definitions are clear and understandable.
In addition, the Directive successfully incorporates the provisions of two other directives to make the legislation more accessible while maintaining the high standards of environmental protection.
A distinction between recovery and disposal has been made clear, with a possibility for the Commission to further delineate this distinction should there be such a need.
A clear five-step 'waste hierarchy' has been set up which promotes waste prevention and allows for disposal of residual waste only as the last resort.
At the same time, it allows for the necessary scope of flexibility justified by sound life-cycle considerations.
I would like to recall the importance given by Parliament during the negotiations to strengthening the upper levels of the 'waste hierarchy' by introducing the recycling targets.
If these targets are not met in 2020, the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive.
In addition, the current formulation introduces a more regular and thorough process of monitoring the measures taken by Member States to attain the required targets in advance of the 2020 deadline, instead of a simple check of the actual compliance levels in 2020 when waste management systems are already in place.
Such an early enforcement process can help to avoid unpleasant surprises in 2020.
Last but not least, the Directive introduces a completely new dimension on waste prevention which the Commission is keen to pursue immediately after its adoption and transposition.
The Member States will now have to establish their national waste management plans and networks which need to reflect the principles and new obligations set out in the revised Directive.
Article 14 of the Waste Framework Directive does not prescribe whether private or public authorities should participate in the setting-up and in the operation of such networks, nor does it affect in any possible way the ownership - public or private - of waste-management operations and infrastructures.
The division of responsibilities between the public and private sectors is an internal matter that can only be decided by the Member States.
If an adequate network of disposal and recovery operations is already in place - be it private, public or mixed - there is no need for additional measures to set it up.
Regarding the concerns relating to the lack of a recycling target for manufacturing and industrial waste, my services will look into the possibility of setting such a target as the first priority within the context of the 2014 review, which is foreseen in Article 8a (point 4).
Regarding the issue of feeding animals with animal by-products such as catering waste, this is regulated by the Animal By-Products Regulation, which is currently under review.
It should be addressed in that regulation as the Waste Framework Directive is not the right place to regulate the use of catering waste.
Concerning the question of whether by-product requirements and end-of-waste criteria must be fulfilled in the European Union before shipment to third countries, the Commission confirms that this is the case.
Regarding the question of whether manure should be excluded from the scope of the Waste Framework Directive, manure is not considered waste when it is used as a fertiliser.
However, it is considered waste when it is destined for further treatment or disposal operations, for instance incineration, production of biogas or compost and landfilling.
Excluding manure from the scope of waste legislation would create a serious gap in environmental protection, since there would be no legal means to control issues such as emissions to air and water, landfilling requirements, noise, odour etc.
Finally, the European Union should promote the production of biogas and the composting of waste.
However, biogas and composting plants are not environmentally neutral.
They also emit to the air and water and can be a source of nuisance, for instance in terms of odours or noise.
Excluding manure destined for biogas production or composting plants from the scope of the Waste Framework Directive would result in excluding such plants from the scope of the IPPC Directive.
To conclude, I should like once again to congratulate and thank Mrs Jackson for her excellent work.
The Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations and can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.
rapporteur. - Madam President, just briefly I would like to thank all those colleagues who took part in the debate.
There is only one colleague that I want to respond to, and that is Mr Davies - hereinafter known as 'Chris 'Newsnight' Davies', for the programme that he likes appearing on - who said that I gave in too easily in the Council.
I hope that my colleagues will reinforce me when I say that I did not give in too easily and that I have never given in easily on anything.
As Mrs Laperrouze will attest on the water issue, the Council is getting increasingly difficult to negotiate with.
As the recession bites, it realises that this legislation is going to cost money and it is reluctant to accept Parliament's amendments.
We have a choice tomorrow morning.
We can agree to the package of amendments before us and I hope very much that is what will happen.
We can vote through some major amendments, for example on by-products, which will mean that the package falls and we all go into conciliation.
Won't that be fun!
Or we can agree perhaps to some minor amendment, or to an amendment which is characterised by its movers as minor, such as Amendment 88 on which I await the Commission's opinion, perhaps overnight.
I think it is very doubtful indeed as to whether the Council will accept any amendments, however minor, so I am in favour of the package itself, unamended.
After all, the package must mean something, otherwise why did the Council fight so strongly over it?
It is not a meaningless package as the Greens are trying to make out; it is a package with teeth.
I would like in conclusion to thank the shadows - Caroline Jackson and the Shadows, it sounds like a 1960s band - for their cooperation, without necessarily wishing to see them again and again and again in conciliation.
I think we ought to try to put this issue to bed tomorrow morning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, 17 June.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (DE) With the new framework directive on waste, Parliament has now won acceptance for the establishment of high and binding recycling quotas.
There was, indeed, an urgent need for these, and I look forward confidently to a future in which waste separation and recycling will be practised to an ever-increasing extent throughout Europe.
I believe that 50% recycling of household waste and 70% recycling of building and demolition waste by 2020 are very good targets that pave the way towards a functioning system of environment-friendly and climate-friendly waste management in the whole of Europe.
Precisely because the Austrians are already exemplary in separating and recycling waste, I am delighted that all the other Member States will now be taking part in these operations, thereby bringing us another step closer to efficient protection of the environment.
We should not forget that waste products are also raw materials and that more efficient use of these materials can help to combat climate change too.
It is now a matter of waiting for the Commission to make its specific proposal as to how we can ensure that economic growth does not mean growing volumes of waste.
Preparation of the European Council following the Irish referendum (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council following the Irish referendum.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) The second meeting of the European Council under the Slovenian Presidency will begin tomorrow.
Allow me to set out the main subjects of discussion to be addressed by Heads of State and Government.
The first debate will most certainly be devoted to examining the situation following the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty held last Thursday in Ireland.
From the onset I would like to reiterate the words of President of the European Council Janez Janša: 'The Presidency regrets the decision taken by Irish voters and is accordingly disappointed.
It goes without saying that we will respect the will expressed by the Irish people.'
After the official outcome of the referendum had been made public, the President of the European Council spoke with a number of leaders of those Member States that have not yet completed the ratification procedure.
It is encouraging to know that these Member States are determined to proceed with ratification.
As underlined by the President of the European Council, the Lisbon Treaty is vital for the European Union and its citizens, as it brings more efficiency, democracy and transparency.
It is a fact that the problems and challenges confronting the Union today remain.
Another fact is that the negative outcome of the Irish referendum will not help to solve these problems.
At tomorrow's meeting of the European Council, Heads of State and Government will deliberate how the situation could best be remedied.
They will endeavour to set a timetable for further work.
The Presidency is convinced that a solution could be found in cooperation with Ireland, and that the Union will not face the recurrence of the situation from 2005.
At the European Council we will listen primarily to the Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen, as he explains the circumstances surrounding the referendum result, and the reasons for such an outcome.
Of course, the European Council will not disregard the other important challenges that lie ahead of us.
The EU continues to function.
Thus, the second major debate by Heads of State and Government will focus on the question of rising food and oil prices.
It is a fact that rising commodity prices contributed to the escalation of inflation of food prices, and to the overall inflation within the EU.
In particular, families with low incomes were most directly hit by these high prices.
Globally, the most affected are developing countries as net food importers.
It is vital for the European Union to play its part in devising appropriate responses and to demonstrate unity in its measures for dealing with the consequences, not only with a focus on the poorest sectors of the EU population, but also in developing countries.
Therefore, it is expected that the European Council will endorse the necessary steps within the EU and at the international level.
Allow me to present them briefly.
The European Union has already taken measures to alleviate the pressure on food prices through the sale of intervention stocks, the reduction in export refunds, the removal of the set-aside requirement for 2008, the increase of milk quotas, and the suspension of import duties for cereals, thus improving supply and helping to stabilise agricultural markets.
Given that low income families are the hardest hit, it is quite natural for Member States to envisage short-term measures to alleviate the pressure of high prices on them particularly.
However, the European Council must look to the longer term.
Nobody really expects food or oil prices to return to the previous levels anytime soon.
I am convinced that the next Presidency will achieve, in close cooperation with the European Parliament, a timely agreement on the CAP health check which will comprise measures for enhancing agricultural production and ensuring the security of food supply.
We also need to pay attention to bio-fuel policies and find a way of ensuring their sustainability, both within the EU and also in other countries.
It will be important to encourage the development of second generation bio-fuels.
More generally, we need to pursue work on innovation and research and development in the agricultural sector to enhance its efficiency and productivity.
Among the initiatives to be pursued at the international level, the European Council intends to point out the Union's contribution to global endeavours for mitigating the effects of rising prices on those living in poverty.
This will include an appeal for a better coordinated international response to the crisis caused by rising food prices, particularly in the framework of the United Nations and the G8 group; support for open trade policies; rapid reactions to immediate short-term humanitarian needs; and encouraging targeted assistance to boost agriculture in developing countries.
In addition to high food prices, the EU faces rising oil prices.
This calls for an adjustment of the European economy, and a special debate to address this issue is planned for today.
A further priority of the Presidency is that the European Council should stress those measures taken to enhance the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
In particular, I would like to underline the completion of a series of Stabilisation and Association Agreements, and the launch of dialogue on visa liberalisation with all countries of the region, as well as the submission of roadmaps.
Furthermore, Heads of State and Government will emphasize the importance of involving all Western Balkans countries in regional cooperation, and welcome a series of sectoral initiatives.
The Western Balkans is a region surrounded by EU Member States, and therefore urgently needs confirmation of its European perspective and assistance in implementing reforms.
The Presidency highly values the support of the European Parliament in this respect.
Another major item on the agenda will be progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2008 is the halfway point in the timeline for achieving these goals.
As the largest donor of development aid, the European Union is aware of its responsibility and is willing to play an active role in encouraging the international community to strive for achievement of the MDGs.
The European Council will therefore stress the key role of the EU at international conferences and its commitments.
The third set of issues to be discussed by the European Council will be about economic, social and environmental matters.
First of all, I would like to touch on the review of work accomplished regarding the climate-energy package.
The Slovenian Presidency has achieved all the set objectives relating to the package in question.
Of crucial importance were the political decisions adopted at the March meeting of the European Council.
The European Council will also take note of the agreement reached in the field of energy market liberalisation, something that was debated in Parliament yesterday.
On the basis of conclusions from December 2007, the European Council will also review progress made in key dossiers pertaining to the area of migration, justice and terrorism.
Finally, Heads of State and Government will address issues relating to European Neighbourhood Policy.
Building on and reinforcing previous successes, the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' will bring further momentum to the Union's relations with the Mediterranean countries.
It will complement ongoing bilateral relations, which will continue within existing policy frameworks.
The European Council is expected to welcome the recent proposals for developing an eastern partnership within European Neighbourhood Policy.
In the margins of the meeting, Heads of State and Government will discuss the Commission's proposal for the accession of the Slovak Republic as the sixteenth Member State to the Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 2009.
I would therefore like to extend my special congratulations to the Slovak Republic.
In short, the views and debates in this Parliament have made a major contribution to formulating the agenda of the European Council.
The debate that will now take place and which we will follow closely, will also represent a useful and important contribution to the discussion among Heads of State and Government, so I shall listen to it with great interest.
(Applause)
President of the Commission. - Madam President, the European Council starting tomorrow has a heavy agenda covering many issues where citizens expect Europe to act.
(Some Members on the right, who were wearing green T-shirts, stood up to display banners and posters calling for respect for the 'no' vote in Ireland.
The President asked them to remove the banners and posters.)
The issues are the surge in oil and food prices, climate change and energy security, migration and asylum to name but a few.
But of course foremost in everybody's mind will be the 'no' vote in Ireland.
This 'no' vote was a disappointment to all those in favour of a stronger, more efficient and accountable European Union.
The Lisbon Treaty remains essential to help us respond to the challenges that Europe faces today; to have a more democratic Union, increasing the powers of this Parliament and recognising the role of national parliaments in European politics; to enhance Europe's capacity to act in areas like migration, energy, climate change, internal security; to increase Europe's coherence and effectiveness on the global stage.
These challenges have not gone away.
The truth is that the 'no' vote did not solve the problems which the Treaty seeks to tackle.
For the last six years we have spent a lot of energy on institutional issues.
With so many key issues pressing for action today we cannot afford this energy to go to waste, and the world does not stop and wait for Europe.
As I said last week, the Commission fully respects the outcome of the Irish referendum.
We must show the same respect for all national ratifications,
(Applause)
whether they have chosen to take the route of referendum or of parliamentary ratification.
There have been 19 democratic decisions in the process so far: 18 in favour of the Lisbon Treaty; one against.
Eight other Member States still have to take position.
The Irish Government has set out clearly its respect for the right of other countries to continue their ratification processes.
This is, I believe, self-evident.
All the countries in Europe are equal; all the countries have the right to express their opinion.
(Applause)
While it is clear that the Lisbon Treaty cannot enter into force before unanimity about its ratification, it is also clear that an Irish vote decides on the Irish position but cannot determine the position of other countries.
I expect the Member States that did not ratify the Lisbon Treaty to continue their own ratification processes.
(Applause)
The European Council gives us all an opportunity to listen very carefully to what Prime Minister Cowen will say.
Then we must work very closely with the Irish Government to help solve this problem.
Let me be clear: Ireland has a responsibility to contribute to finding a solution.
When governments sign the Treaty they assume a responsibility to have it ratified.
But let me be equally clear: this is a time for us to be serious about solidarity.
Twenty-seven Member States signed the Treaty; we must make every effort to make sure that 27 Member States find a way forward.
Member States are equal in their dignity and we should be clear about that.
This will take time and effort for the Irish, but also for all of us.
I do not think that we can rush into a premature decision about the next step.
We need to take the time to find a real consensus and see what is possible for Ireland.
But equally we should not take too long.
I know that this Parliament is keen to give voters clarity on the way forward by the time of the European elections.
The European Commission is ready to make its contribution - and I am sure this Parliament is too - but there is no way around the fact that governments have a particular responsibility here: in signing the Treaty, in making sure it is ratified, in promoting the European project in their national public opinions.
And on this last point let me make a general comment that I think may be useful for the debate that is going on now.
Years of treating the European institutions as a convenient scapegoat leaves fertile ground for populist campaigns.
(Applause)
As I have said several times before, you cannot bash Brussels or Strasbourg from Monday to Saturday and expect citizens to vote in favour of Europe on Sunday.
(Applause)
Tomorrow the European Council will also stress that the 'no' vote must not be a reason for the European Union to fall into the trap of institutional navel-gazing.
We have made important progress in the past couple of years and it has been on the back of a determined effort to deliver policies in the interests of European citizens.
At a time when rising food and oil prices are leading to great expectations for action, we cannot afford to abandon this path.
That is why I very much welcome Prime Minister Janez Janša and the Slovenian presidency's decision to ring-fence the debate on Lisbon to the dinner on Thursday night and to devote the rest of the European Council to furthering our policy agenda.
Today, everyone is feeling the pressure of price rises in food and fuel but for some there is an extra burden.
For poorer households these costs are a bigger share of the household budget so the rises hit even harder.
The same is true for some economic activities, with fuel so critical for some industries.
In two communications on food and oil prices the Commission has made a careful analysis of the causes of the price rises, of where the squeeze is most intense and of what we can and should do.
The European Union needs to show that it is bringing to bear the full range of measures available at European and national level.
We need to take a dynamic and imaginative look at the tools at our disposal - to look at what will have a real impact in the short, medium and long term.
Let us remember previous oil shocks where Europe failed to learn the long-term lessons.
Let us hope this time it will be not as it happened in the past, where after all the oil shocks we came back to business as usual.
I hope this time we really have an opportunity to change, and to change the paradigm of energy consumption in Europe and in the world.
To alleviate problems on food inside the European Union we will come forward with proposals to extend our scheme to distribute food to the most deprived before seeking a two-thirds increase in the budget for this specific area.
In addition, the European Union has tools which can and will be brought to bear: to monitor prices, to use competition powers to check the food supply chain, boosting reserves, ensuring that the CAP is well attuned to the current realities of the agricultural market.
As for oil prices, immediate steps are justified to help the most hard-pressed households.
However, it will be futile for governments to use public money to offset energy-price rises that are here, most likely, to stay.
We should also look at the levels available to the European Union in areas such as competition and taxation.
The Commission will come up with proposals to increase transparency in emergency and commercial oil stocks.
We will also come with proposals on taxation to support and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, namely in the field of energy efficiency.
We will also support a high-level meeting of producers and consumers of oil and fossil fuel energy.
Specifically on fisheries: we will come forward with an emergency package to address problems of economic and social hardship, allowing Member States to give short-term emergency aid, and we will look again at the rules on small-scale state aid.
I have three points here.
First, it must be coordinated: we should avoid a rash of national initiatives which simply displace the problems elsewhere in the Union.
Secondly, we must target our alleviation efforts on the worst-hit segments of the fleet.
Thirdly, we must find structural solutions to overcapacity in the fishing industry.
The pressures being faced by Europeans today show why the European Union's goals on energy security, energy efficiency and climate change are so crucial to the well-being of European society, and this is why they are more urgent than ever.
As demand continues to outstrip supply in oil and gas, the goals agreed last year provide a ready-made path to reduce Europe's vulnerability and to reduce the economic pain of future price hikes.
The key aspects of the package of proposals that we have put forward and are now being considered by this Parliament will make a decisive contribution.
The basic idea is the following: the prices of energy most likely will never go back to previous levels, so there is a structural problem there.
We can, and we should, have short-term answers, namely for those who are the most vulnerable in our societies.
However, for a structural problem we need a structural answer, a structural response.
The structural response is our climate change and renewables package; it is not to be dependent on fossil fuels but to promote renewables and to do more in terms of energy efficiency.
That is the basic line we should follow.
(Applause)
So I hope that now in Europe those who still have doubts about the importance of changing our energy paradigm, those who still have doubts about the need to fight climate change, will understand at last that, if not because of that but because of energy security and because of the need to increase our competitiveness in our economy, we really need to deliver on our commitments regarding climate change and renewables.
The structural response to the structural challenges we face basically is to save and diversify.
By saving I mean increasing energy efficiency where we have a huge unexploited potential.
Diversification covers both the sources and the geographical origin of energy.
Both are about increasing Europe's energy security.
Adoption of our climate change and energy security package is, therefore, a matter of urgency.
The task of the European Council will be to give a signal about this and to prepare everything to reach a political agreement at the latest, we hope, by next December.
I think it is an important task of the European Council to show that the 'no' vote on the Lisbon Treaty is not an excuse to avoid action.
It should not mean paralysis for Europe.
We must show that we will find the right way to secure the efficient and democratic Europe the Treaty has been designed to deliver.
Let me conclude with a more political remark.
I think we - those who have supported and are supporting the Lisbon Treaty, this Parliament and the Commission - should not make apologies for that, because the competition outside is stronger than ever; it will be tougher than ever.
What we need is a European Union that works better for our citizens, to deliver on the real challenges that face us.
Those challenges will remain: the problems of energy security, the problem of climate change, the problems of international terrorism, the problems of increased competition coming from emerging powers, and the problems of migration.
Those challenges are there and we need to tackle them in a more efficient manner.
Therefore, let us not now put the blame on the European Union.
Let us be honest about it.
It is true that very often when we hold a referendum we have seen a 'no' vote regarding Europe.
But let us be completely honest.
If there were a referendum on most of our national policies and most of our initiatives, would we always have a 'yes' vote?
Therefore, let us not always put the blame on the European Union or the European intuitions.
The truth is that, today, to take political decisions at European, national or regional level is a very tough matter.
Therefore, we have to be wise, prudent and serious about it.
We should not always put the blame on the European Union.
On the contrary, we should work to make it better: be modest about the setbacks, understand what is not going well, make our improvements and not give up on our commitment.
I believe the best way to do that is to avoid pessimism and not to go back to a situation of crisophilie, a crisis for the sake of a crisis.
Pessimism will not solve this problem.
It is true we have a serious problem, but we should solve it and not fall back into depression.
The best way to show that we are committed to our project - and in that regard I would also like to welcome the intentions of the French presidency - is to work concretely on the most important areas where the European Union can deliver and help our Member States deliver on those problems that are really the first concern of our citizens.
I hope that we will not be demoralised by this and will keep our line.
What we need, of course, is sailors and navigators for fair weather but also for stormy times.
I believe we should stay on course and go on with our project so that Europe is more necessary than ever.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of Irish people who voted expressed their opposition to the Lisbon Treaty.
My Group respects that decision just as it also respects that of the 18 Member States that have to date expressed their support for the Treaty and ratified it.
The European Union is founded on freedom of expression and democracy.
Therefore, because we are democrats, we want all of the Member States to express their opinion on the ratification of the Treaty.
It is only at the end of this process that the European Council will be able to decide which path to take; in other words - not to take anything away from Ireland's decision - no Member State should deprive the others of freely expressing their position.
We hope that this week the European Council will carry out a calm, responsible and constructive analysis of the situation ensuing from this vote.
The PPE members of my Group hope that the European Council will ask the Member States that have not yet done so to continue with their ratification procedures as is only fit and proper.
Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Ireland have spoken.
They have voiced their concerns about the purpose of European integration, about the way in which Europe is run, about the future of the agricultural policy, about the WTO negotiations, about the tax policy.
The Irish vote also reflects the fact that many people do not understand the complexity of the European Union, whose relevance is not always evident to them.
It is a manifestation of the question many citizens are asking about the very purpose of European integration.
My motivation and that of my generation - in other words, ensuring peace in our continent - is no longer understood by the younger generations.
The Irish 'no' vote is a plea for a better definition of Europe's goals and a better explanation of the reasons for pursuing further integration.
The European Parliament, which adopts texts that are often difficult to read, must play a full role in this exercise.
By voting 'no', however, did the Irish mean that when it comes to climate and energy, the new food order, personal safety, immigration or foreign policy our countries are self-sufficient and can act on an equal footing with the United States, China, India or Brazil?
I do not think so.
By voting 'no', did the Irish mean that solidarity with the poorest countries, from which they have significantly and rightly benefited in recent decades, is no longer relevant and that the rule from now on is every man for himself?
I do not think so.
Finally, by voting 'no' did the Irish want to turn over a new leaf as far as European integration is concerned and were they expressing a negative opinion on the accession of a country like Croatia?
I do not think so.
The PPE members of my Group firmly believe that the Lisbon Treaty, which was the subject of long negotiations and which was signed by the 27 Member States, is a major step forward in comparison to the Nice Treaty.
It enables Europe to function better and it gives it the tools it needs to be speak with a louder voice on the world stage.
I have only one wish and that is for Europe's period of introspection to come to an end as quickly as possible.
It is time for our countries - if I may use the expression - to stop navel-gazing and work together to overcome the real problems and the real challenges.
These challenges should spur us to action and they also give rise to serious concerns, and sometimes anger, as we will see once again in Brussels on Thursday, among all those who are weakened and handicapped by the current situation.
Mr President-in-Office, my request is that tomorrow in the Council you take account of the real problems, of the welfare of our fellow European citizens, and deal head-on with all of the increases that are worrying our citizens.
In this heated debate, the PPE members of my Group are calling for calm and reason.
We must listen to the Irish, we must learn from their vote and we must treat the people of the other European nations with the same respect.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, for eight years now, we have constantly been ratifying some treaty or other.
We have been ratifying ourselves to death.
During these eight years, the European Union has undergone a period of introspection and has focused on its own institutional reforms, albeit without much success.
This is the same European Union that requires accession candidates to undertake transformation processes, and yet it is apparently unable to manage this for itself.
How much credibility does that leave us?
Commission President, you have said, quite correctly, that Europe's institutions are not to blame and we should not allow them always to be made the scapegoat.
You are absolutely right, but exactly who is making them the scapegoat?
In Europe's capitals, there are a great many people who will convene for the Council on Thursday, and each time they go back home, if the Council meeting in Brussels has been successful, they say: 'It was all down to us, the heads of state and government', and if it was unsuccessful, they say, 'It was their fault, the people in Brussels!'
You should tell the Council what you have told us here.
Incidentally, the debate conducted with you here in this House takes place in public, but the heads of state and government will be meeting on Thursday behind closed doors yet again.
There needs to be a stop to that as well.
It is the Member States who bear the responsibility!
(Applause)
We have a downward spiral, a negative spiral, which is a dangerous one.
The process of European integration is on the line.
The Irish have had their referendum and we must respect the results, but there was an element which perturbed me greatly.
With the exception of Sinn Féin - and I will not waste words on them here - all the Irish parties, the PPE-DE, the Liberals and our own party were calling for a 'yes', and the Irish people voted 'no'.
This is the wake-up call, and everyone, including us here in this Chamber, is affected by the fact that there is a crisis of confidence, a crisis of mistrust, vis-à-vis the national institutions, and indeed the supranational institutions.
I can do without your applause.
Whether Irish sovereignty is represented by UKIP's ideology is debatable, in my view.
The Irish can do without your protection.
Let me say this very clearly: we must stand together in response to this crisis of confidence, and we must take it seriously.
Commission President, I have been wondering when you would finally say a word or two about your Commissioner McCreevy today.
(Applause)
This is the man who is responsible for internal market policy in the European Union: the same internal market which, due to its social inequality, more and more citizens are understandably viewing as a threat, not an opportunity.
This man, who is responsible in your Commission for the internal market, goes to Ireland and says that he has not read the Lisbon Treaty and would not expect voters to do so either.
How can that possibly increase public confidence?
(Applause)
Let me say this: the best social policy measure for Europe that you could propose on 3 July is to withdraw this portfolio from Mr McCreevy, for he has proved that he is not up to the job.
I cannot accept a Commissioner for the Internal Market who represents such a skewed approach to politics.
Deregulating the internal market to breaking point is what Mr McCreevy wants to do, regardless of what it costs, without any social flanking measures at EU level or in the Member States: that is the crisis which is being felt by Europe's citizens!
When it comes to this particular Commissioner, you need to take action!
(Applause)
I would also have liked to hear you say something about the crisis in the financial markets.
I have yet to hear you say a word about the turmoil in the financial markets.
Let me also address a comment to Mr Daul: there are 21 heads of government across the European Union who belong to your political family or the Liberals, and an equally large number of Members of the Commission.
The PPE-DE Group in this House is, I gladly admit, open-minded when it comes to certain social policy measures.
I urge you to talk to your heads of government at last, and to talk to your colleagues in the Council!
What Europe needs is concerted action in the social arena.
You have the majority in Europe, in the Council, in the Commission and also here in this House.
For once, you could demonstrate the social responsibility that you have just been calling for.
I invite you to do so, for example in relation to my colleague Paul Nyrup Rasmussen's report on control of the international financial markets.
I invite you to follow up your grand statements on social responsibility with some action.
A warm welcome to you, Mr Daul!
(Applause)
We will find a way out of this impasse, I am certain of that.
In one way or another, we will undoubtedly get the Irish back on board.
However, that will not help us!
We must recognise that there was once a time when the pro-European movement had a heart and soul.
As Mr Daul pointed out, this was after the war, when Europe's peacemaking mystique melded people together.
Now, it is the anti-Europe movement which has the heart and soul, and you can see that they are extremely active.
They raced round Ireland, climbed staircases, rang doorbells, canvassed and distributed their campaign materials.
They were in evidence everywhere.
Where were the pro-Europeans?
Where is the movement which campaigns for European integration?
Where is the passion that we once had?
The passion has migrated to the other side, the side which speaks ill of Europe, on the right wing of the political spectrum.
It lies with those who speak ill of Europe, and who do so simply because they are afraid.
In Europe, however, this mixture of social decline and fear has always opened the door to fascism.
I therefore appeal to all the constructive democratic forces in Europe to take this movement seriously!
Let us finally join forces again for one purpose: to remind ourselves that there has never been a more successful project to safeguard peace in Europe and the world than the transnational, intercultural, inter-faith movement which is based on a balance of social interests and is called the European Union.
It is a project worth fighting for, because we cannot let these people gain the upper hand.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, as the Irish Prime Minister sets out for Brussels tomorrow, he might well chew over the words of the Irish pop group U2: 'Where did it all go wrong?'
The other heads of state and government should also reflect why, on the threshold of a new French presidency, we have come full circle since the last: from Nice to Nice.
There is clear evidence that a majority in every Member State supports the European Union.
There is scant evidence that a majority in any favours further construction.
We cannot say for sure that any treaty would get a majority in any country.
Trust in institutions is ebbing away.
So it is no good for blithe spirits in Berlin to whistle that other U2 hit 'With or without you', or for people in Paris to push Ireland into voting again.
As Brecht pointed out, you cannot dissolve the people.
Though fewer than a million voted against, and in a landscape littered with lies, the people are not persuaded.
Why?
First, because we've done little to convince them of the changes we champion.
The Commission has a Plan 'D' for Dialogue, but our Member State governments have no equivalent.
Certainly there is a role for Parliament and Commission in explaining the European Union - but also for every national government, every single day, not just when ratification of the latest treaty is due.
And there is a job here, too, not just for political parties at European level, but for political parties in every Member State.
Second, while the EU has created great wealth, it is now amassed less honestly and spread less fairly.
Our political and our business leaders must come to grips with huge ethical issues.
And Mr Schulz, I am sorry you have only five heads of state of government these days, but those issues are no less valid in the countries run by Socialists than they are in any other!
(Applause)
Third, for all the freedoms for goods and for capital - and even for services - our Union is not famed for freedoms for its people.
Cross-border complications in civil law - custody of children in divorce cases, problems with properties abroad - fill the mailbags of MEPs.
A lack of safeguards in cross-border criminal cases and a cavalier approach to data protection add to that unease.
What the EU promises in theory, it too often fails to deliver in practice.
This is the backdrop against which our response to Ireland must be measured.
Here in this House, we want the new Treaty.
We know it helps put right these wrongs.
But beyond this forest of metal and glass, this is too little understood.
So my group's advice to Council is this.
Get on with the real business of Europe: boosting trade, combating climate change, fighting food and fuel price rises.
Let those who will continue to ratify the Treaty.
If necessary, make do with Nice.
Use the passerelle clause to speed up Europe's problem-solving potential.
Forget the full-time president until you settle what the six-month stagiaire is going to do.
Launch a comprehensive campaign to remind people why the EU exists, inform them how it works and explain why, like the proverbial pint of Guinness, it is good for you.
Europe means too much to too many to allow this crisis to stop it in its tracks.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always said that what the European Union needs is a short constitution, with a charter of binding rights, democratic and transparent decision-making procedures, limited but genuine powers and the requisite economic resources.
Such a constitution, ladies and gentlemen, should be drawn up by this House or by a constituent assembly, upheld with vigour and conviction, without hypocrisy, and ratified by the parliamentary method or in a European referendum.
I have great respect for the wishes of the Irish people, but no one will ever convince me that a referendum in which half of the electorate turned out is more democratic than parliamentary ratification.
If the majority of peoples and states vote yes, one goes ahead, and those who vote no can cheerfully remain outside and negotiate a system of new, looser relations, as the Spinelli Treaty of 1984 put it.
What has happened in recent years?
The Member States and the Commission have gone down the road of a complicated, contradictory treaty that is difficult to sell and, in the final stages, was negotiated in secret, in haste, and made even more illegible by its exemptions and protocols.
Meanwhile they decided that it had to be ratified unanimously, exactly like the gardener's dog that neither eats cabbage itself nor lets anybody else.
As if that were not enough, the European Union is continuing to adopt misguided, weak policies, such as the Jackson directive yesterday and the Weber report today, which are incapable of offering us any positive prospects or hope.
This is a Union where everything from workers' rights to environmental protection to migrants' rights is given less and less consideration, where industrial lobbies count for more than citizens, where the European interest is lost, buried beneath the howls of one government or another, where freedom of choice and individual liberties or the arrival of new Europeans are seen as an unbearable attack on the identity of populations which, like those of Italy and Ireland, have migrants scattered in every part of the world.
It is possible, and perhaps also desirable, that the countries having yet to ratify will do so.
It may be that the Irish Government will come up with a brilliant proposal.
But a diplomatic solution is not enough!
A diplomatic solution is not enough.
Now more than ever we need to state loud and clear that the Europe of governments - opaque and obscure - is the Europe that has failed: the one that rejected the constitution and is continuing to pursue misguided, conservative, narrow-mindedly nationalist and egotistical policies; the one that put paid to the spirit of the 2003 European Convention, ending up instead with an agreement on a positive but minimalistic, soulless text.
However, none of this makes a more democratic, proactive, united Europe any less necessary.
What is needed today is an initiative stemming from our political strengths and from those Member States which are convinced of the need for a more efficient, more democratic, more cohesive Europe, given that it is now no longer necessary or possible to continue with the Treaty of Nice.
Such an initiative will have no scope for those unwilling to move forward.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office, the President of the Commission and my colleagues for their contributions so far.
Obviously, what has occurred was not anticipated.
The 'no' vote in Ireland represents a sea-change with regard to the opinion of one set of voters within the European Union towards the European Union project.
Because of the diversity of those who opposed this Treaty in the referendum in Ireland, because of the different viewpoints - both politically and ideologically opposite to each other on many occasions - it is difficult to extrapolate from that exactly why the people voted 'no'.
What we have requested is that we be given time to look at and analyse those results, to find ways to move forward and what can be done.
Because this - even people on the 'no' side claim - was not a vote against Europe, despite the fact that some on the 'no' side have voted 'no' on every single European referendum since Ireland first acceded in 1972.
But they claim that this is not a vote against Europe.
Likewise, they claim this is not a way of reducing what Europe does.
But their big slogan during the campaign was 'vote "no” for a stronger Europe'.
Maybe now those on the 'no' side could come forward and tell us what kind of stronger Europe they want to see happening, what solutions they wish to bring forward as regards how we move forward in dealing with the global challenges and difficulties that face us.
Today in Brussels we have farmers and hauliers protesting at the high price of fuel.
This time last year a barrel of oil cost USD 48; today it is USD 140.
This time last year the price of food in Haiti was affordable for even the poorest people; today there are riots in the streets of Haiti because of the shortage of food and the difficulties this creates.
These are the challenges that we must respond to at a European level; these are the difficulties that we must tackle.
Let us not forget the world is not going to collapse.
We have been here before: both the French and the Dutch said 'no' to a previous treaty and a mechanism was found to organise and advance the European project.
This is not a time for recrimination or finger-pointing.
However, despite what some of the protesters within this Chamber may think, this is a time for respect: not just respect for the Irish voters, who gave their democratic opinion with regard to this Treaty, but respect for the other countries and their individual rights on how they operate and how they ratify a treaty.
It is not up to us to dictate to anybody what advances can and cannot be made.
I say to those who wear T-shirts inside this House that not only do they disrespect this House and the Members of this House, but they in no way stand for or represent the Irish people or the Irish nation.
(Applause)
I want to make it clear that those same flag-wavers over here on my left, those same people who claim to defend the rights of Irish people were the same people who appeared on Irish television celebrating a 'no' vote in Ireland in a pub in Brussels.
Of course drink was consumed, but what respect do they have for the Irish people and the Irish flag that they use the Irish flag as a tablecloth to put their drinks on?
That is what this group represents; that is the kind of disrespect they have for the people.
(Applause)
Allow us to move forward.
The European project is one worth saving.
It is not just about peace or prosperity, it is about solidarity.
Many years ago Sean O'Casey, the Irish poet, wrote in Juno and the Paycock: 'I ofen looked up at the sky an' assed meself the question - what is the moon, what is the stars?'
Maybe today we have to ask ourselves a question for this generation: what does the European Union actually mean and where do we want it go?
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council would be well-advised to refrain from displaying any sort of arrogance towards the people of Ireland, who merely exercised a democratic right recognised by their Constitution.
Rather than calling for the continuation of the ratification process in an attempt to isolate this new black sheep, it would be better to knuckle down to a clear analysis of the situation.
The Irish 'no' vote was particularly strong among the working classes and I would remind you that turnout was much higher than in the past; according to my Group, this reveals that the crisis surrounding the legitimacy of the current European model is growing ever deeper.
This crisis was already at the heart of the French and Dutch 'no' votes; it is expressed differently elsewhere but it is always an underlying element.
Remember the large-scale protests against the Bolkestein Directive; think of the debate that arose after the Laval and Viking affairs, particularly in Scandinavian countries, or in Germany after the Rüffert judgment.
In this respect, I want to say to my friend Martin Schulz that I agree completely with what he said about Mr McCreevy.
The problem is that those decisions - the ones I have just mentioned - were taken not by Mr McCreevy but by the Court of Justice on the basis of specific articles (Articles 43 and 49 of the current Treaties incorporated in the Lisbon Treaty).
Think, too, of the political impact of the powerful strike in Dacia, Romania against 'low-cost Europe'.
Look at the anger of farmers or small-scale fishermen who are in dire straits.
What lies at the root of all these situations is first and foremost the current European economic and social model: instead of providing security, it leads to greater insecurity.
That is the number one problem.
Another factor is the way in which the Union functions.
Decisions are taken far from the people and without the people.
We are content with explaining them to them rather then consulting them.
The deliberate decision to present the Lisbon Treaty in a form that is totally illegible to a lay person is, in this respect, a spectacular illustration of what I would call 'the ivory tower syndrome'.
This has devastating effects on our citizens, especially the less populated nations, which feel as though they are being bandied about to satisfy the interests of the more powerful nations.
Finally, there are more and more questions in many countries, including Ireland, about the role Europe plays in the world, where it is expected to ensure that there is a much stronger emphasis on the force of politics rather than the politics of force.
Running away from these debates means exacerbating the crisis in Europe; conducting them in complete transparency would be a first step on the road to finding a solution.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, nobody else has said it, but I will: well done the Irish!
(Applause from certain quarters)
And yet, before the official result was out, there was Mr Barroso, holding a press conference in Brussels, looking as shifty and as dishonest as anybody I have ever seen, saying - despite what the rules of the club are - that the Treaty is not dead and we continue.
Frankly, it was a disgusting display; it was an insult to democracy.
It is perfectly clear that the ratifications should stop now and the implementation of the Treaty should stop now.
I used to think, after the French and Dutch results, that you were in denial, but now I realise that what is behind this is a new phenomenon: it is 'EU nationalism', and it is the most dangerous political phenomenon to have swept Europe since 1945.
You ignore the voters, you are destroying democracy, and you have shown that you will stop at nothing.
Well, ask yourself: why are the politicians, why is this class, now unpopular?
Well, later on today, Mr Barroso, this House will be voting for a new Justice Commissioner, and it is likely that a former convicted fraudster will, after today, be the Justice Commissioner for the European Union.
In fact you do not need the UK Independence Party.
You are destroying the European Union in the eyes of the voters.
Well done everybody!
(Applause from certain quarters)
Madam President, may I remind this House that the rule of law is more important than the laws themselves.
(Loud protests)
Lisbon required unanimity.
Ignore that and you ignore the rule of law itself.
The Irish are not just 10% of the EU, they are 100% of those allowed to vote and they all know, we all know, that others would have voted 'no' given the chance.
(Further loud protests)
Lisbon was incomprehensible and the Irish knew why.
Others would have voted 'no' given the chance.
Suggesting now that the process should go on, devising clever ways of regenerating Lisbon in open defiance of public will, is an arrogance of breathtaking proportions and we have seen it all before.
The Austrian Foreign Minister stood here after the rejection of the previous Treaty and boasted about 36 projects and institutions still going ahead; they still have no legitimacy after the failure of the Lisbon Treaty to get unanimity.
I have a message for you from Edmund Burke: 'The people are the masters, not you, and you ignore that and the rule of law at your peril'.
(Applause from certain quarters)
President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would on this occasion like to highlight the remarkable consensus in this House on the next steps to be taken.
We believe, with just a few exceptions that merely add colour to the debate, that it would be wise for all the Member States to complete their ratification processes.
That is also the opinion that has been expressed by the Irish Government and by the Members, specifically Mr Crowley, who is Irish and who has stated that all the countries have the same right to express their opinion.
If we can thus conclude this process, we will be in a position to discuss the matter constructively with our Irish friends in a spirit of solidarity, for there can be no union without solidarity.
I believe that this is the consensus that is being consolidated, and I hope that it will be consolidated by the debate in the European Council tomorrow and beyond.
In any event, it is the position that the Commission is going to present to the European Council.
At the same time, as many of you have pointed out, including Mr Watson and others, it is important not to become paralysed by examining solely the institutional question.
The best way of consolidating the European Union's democratic legitimacy is to provide results and to demonstrate that we are working for our citizens; indeed, the world cannot wait for Europe to take its institutional decisions. There are urgent issues such as climate change, energy security and migration that demand responses from the Union, even with the current institutional framework.
Another point, which I would address to my good friend Mr Schulz, is that we need to avoid finding easy scapegoats.
Obviously I was not particularly pleased with the comments made by my fellow Commissioner, Mr McCreevy.
However, I could also mention certain comments by national politicians that were not helpful in this process, and even Members of this House who do not always say what we want to hear.
Let us be realistic!
In the constituency in which Mr McCreevy campaigned, the 'yes' vote won, and I think that attacking the Irish Commissioner now is not the best way to ensure successful dialogue with our Irish friends.
We must concentrate on the positive aspects without trying to find easy scapegoats; that would not be fair.
If we act in a spirit of cooperation with our institutions, if we concentrate on the results the citizens expect from us, if we find the best atmosphere for this dialogue, I believe that it will be possible to resolve this problem.
It is a serious problem, but it is a problem that can be resolved.
We will not resolve it with recriminations, nor with pessimism, 'crisophilie' or talk of decline.
We will resolve it by endeavouring, through our results, to reinforce our democratic legitimacy and by recognising that all of us must act, in the European institutions and in the national governments, and that we have a shared responsibility to keep our ideal, our European ideal alive.
(Applause)
Mr President, the EU as we know is based upon four freedoms: freedom of movement of people, goods, capital and services.
When Jean Monnet shared his vision of Europe all those years ago, he said - if colleagues will forgive my mangled French -'Nous ne coalisons pas des États, nous unissons des hommes'.
The EU is supposed to be about people, not about politicians so, not only does it need to be driven by the people, the people need to see and believe that it is driven by the people.
Last Thursday we heard the people speak and their verdict was clear; the answer was a simple 'no'.
I recall the background to the first Constitution Treaty.
There was recognition that the EU was becoming more remote from the people and that there was a need to do something about it.
The declared solution was to prepare a Treaty that would make the EU more simple, more transparent, more close to the people.
But, by the time politicians had finished with it, they had produced a Treaty which was more complicated, more opaque and even further away from the people.
Certainly, that is what the people believe still about this latest Treaty.
Our response cannot be to carry on as if nothing has happened.
If the people perceive that the EU is moving further away from them, then for the politicians to carry on regardless will simply make this problem worse.
Our problem must not be to discuss the speed at which the EU should now move; it should be to discuss its direction.
Listen to the people and they will tell you.
If the ratification process continues, it will show that EU leaders have learnt nothing and that politicians still believe they know best and that it is the people who are wrong.
By definition, the people are always right.
It is called democracy.
We want an EU which is people-centred and which delivers that democracy.
So we must not ignore the Irish vote; we should build upon it.
The ratification process should stop.
The listening to the people should begin.
(Applause)
To conclude: Martin Schulz said in his very powerful and elegant speech that there is a crisis of confidence.
I agree with him.
It is the people who have lost confidence with the politicians.
It is an opportunity for us to recognise this, to show that we have listened, and to regain and rebuild their trust.
It is not good enough for all of us just to become great speakers; we have to show we can be great listeners too.
(Applause)
Mr President, no, no, no!
What the honourable Member has just said is not democracy.
Democracy is to say, 'We respect the Irish, as we respect every other Member State's decisions'.
Therefore, I endorse the remarks made by the President of the Commission: we have a consensus here in Parliament on the process, respecting the Irish but respecting also all the other Member States.
Let us continue the process; this is what we have to continue today.
Second point: no more pauses, please!
No more 'reflection' thing.
No more wishy-washiness.
Let us focus on the real problems: that is what we have to do.
Of course, President Barroso has to defend his Commissioners, including Mr McCreevy.
When we criticise Mr McCreevy, this is not a personal issue.
When the chairman of my group mentions Mr McCreevy, it is because of his policy - and his policy is also Mr Barroso's policy.
Mr Barroso said many wise things today, but when he was talking about competition powers I did not hear anything about speculation on the financial markets against food prices.
I would have liked to have heard that, and I would have liked to have heard that from Mr McCreevy.
I did not hear Mr Barroso say, when he was talking about the economic thing, that we are lacking jobs in Europe.
I would have liked to have heard him say that, due to the financial crisis, we are losing jobs.
I would like to see the Commission coming up with a new economic revitalisation plan - not a theoretical one, but a coordinated investment action.
Thirdly, Mr McCreevy is right now trying to say that the whole reason why we have a financial crisis is the agencies and bureaux - Standard & Poors, FTSE and others - and that we are going to regulate them.
But that is, in a sense, to shoot the messenger.
I really feel that the Commission President should say to us today: yes, I agree, we have a financial crisis and, yes, I agree, we need to have universal regulation, better than the one we have, so that our answer can be new jobs and a better climate, not more money and not more focus on how to create money from nothing, instead of production and jobs.
Give us that impression today and you have the real message for ordinary people.
Mr President, as an Irish Member, I represent the 54% who voted 'no' and the 46% who voted 'yes'.
Those who are true democrats look not only to the result but strive to represent all of the people.
I represent a sovereign state but you cannot uphold the sovereignty of your own Member State - in my case, Ireland - unless you uphold the sovereignty of all Member States.
In this context, if other Member States decide to exercise their sovereignty and ratify the Lisbon Treaty, or otherwise, no real democrat, no flag-flying democrat who today claims to be Irish, can legitimately object. Ireland speaks for Ireland;
Slovenia for Slovenia.
That is real democracy and that is real sovereignty.
A core issue in the Lisbon debate in Ireland was the principle of unanimity.
For Lisbon to be ratified, we need unanimity.
All 27 Member States must agree - that is core.
This is the first real test of unanimity under Lisbon.
We must not fail that test and therein lies the challenge.
As politicians, our job is to rise to that challenge, to listen to our citizens, to find solutions and to get on with the business of building a better Europe.
Some on the 'no' side in Ireland spoke of a better deal.
Let us be optimistic and look for a better deal for all citizens.
We need some time and space in Ireland to reflect and respond to find solutions.
The good will for Europe is there in Ireland.
Who could have forecast in 1945, when Europe lay in ruins, that in 2008 we would celebrate 50 years of peace?
Let that be our inspiration.
Europe is a work in progress, a process - difficult, certainly, but always, always worthwhile.
That is why we are here.
European citizens want a Union that works.
So do Irish citizens.
Of that I am one hundred percent certain.
Let us not disappoint them.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the message I am getting from the governments is that this is an Irish problem.
When I talk to citizens, the message I get from them is that this is a European problem, and a conflict with Europe.
The governments tell us that it is a diplomatic conflict.
The citizens tell us that it is an affront to their sovereignty; they feel that they are being excluded, and they feel deeply aggrieved.
The governments tell us that this 'no' vote is incomprehensible.
When I listen to the citizens, they tell us that it is the Treaty and the process which are incomprehensible.
The governments tell us that they have to tackle the real agenda.
The citizens tell us that for years, they have been drawing attention to the real agenda, and may I say to the Commission President that they do not mean the military, police and internal security: they mean social responsibility and a European answer to globalisation.
They mean more democracy and transparency.
Mr President-in-Office, the governments plan to ask the Irish Government what prompted the 'no' vote.
Instead, the governments should be asking themselves this: who is really to blame?
The governments ignored the writing on the wall after the 'no' vote in France and the Netherlands.
Have the governments genuinely addressed the real issues?
When overhauling the Treaty, did they really respond to disappointed expectations?
Were the French not vocal enough in their calls for a new social order, more social responsibility and equity?
Were the demands for more democracy simply not clear enough?
So what did you do?
You just rehashed the Treaty and created an unreadable hotch-potch of footnotes, cross-references and subtext, and you wonder why citizens are rejecting it.
There is one major risk in this affront to sovereignty.
It is not only an affront to the Irish people; there is a real risk that this sense of grievance will spread and that Europeans as a whole will say: the Irish people have voted for us!
The responsibility for that lies with you, the governments!
The time really has come .
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, this is a very tense debate.
I would, however, advise caution, great caution when making statements following the Irish referendum.
Any suggestion that Ireland should be shamed or even excluded from the Union is far more damaging to Europe than the outcome of the referendum itself.
Unfortunately, Mr Schulz, who was, as is his wont, somewhat excited, did make such a suggestion.
We should bear in mind that the paternalistic attitude adopted by Brussels caused irritation in Ireland and was one of the reasons why the people of Ireland voted against the Treaty.
It is not true that Europe will suffer without the new Treaty.
Europe will suffer as a result of conflicts of interest and because of the Member States' selfishness.
That has nothing to do with Ireland.
Europe's foreign policy will suffer because of Germany, for example.
Germany wishes to establish good relations for itself with Russia at the expense of the countries of Central Europe.
France is also to blame for turning a blind eye to Russia's neo-imperialistic policy in the region whilst uttering platitudes about how Europe, Poland included, is to forge ahead.
The Treaty should not be used as a smokescreen for our own failings.
The decision taken by the people of Ireland must not be used to conceal our own failings.
(Applause)
(GA) Mr President, Irish people have spoken.
The vote that Irish people cast against the Treaty of Lisbon last Thursday was not a vote against the EU.
Ireland's place is in the EU.
Ireland has obtained social and economic benefits - both north and south - due to its Membership, although some difficulties also exist.
The issue was: Is the Treaty of Lisbon good for the people of Ireland, for the rest of Europe or for the developing world?
The Treaty of Lisbon was put before the people in Ireland and it has been rejected.
The Treaty of Lisbon is over.
Irish citizens, like those in France and the Netherlands previously, want a better deal.
We now have the opportunity to re-open the debate on the future of Europe.
We must embrace this opportunity.
It would not be acceptable for EU leaders to seek ways of avoiding or circumventing the democratically expressed wishes of the people.
The ratification process must stop, just as it did following the rejection of the EU Constitution.
But on this occasion we must listen to the Irish people; we must listen to the people.
Many of the same concerns came up in Ireland as were raised previously in France and in the Netherlands.
Those concerns must be listened to.
We must address those concerns.
Throughout the referendum campaign in Ireland, a number of key issues came up again and again: the democratic deficit, Ireland's loss of power in Europe, neutrality and non-militarisation, workers' rights and public services, and the Treaty's impact on the developing world.
These issues must be addressed.
The European project is now put to the democratic test through its response to the vote in Ireland.
Does it listen to the people, does it respect their democratic wishes, or does it alienate its citizens by setting all of that aside?
In my view, democracy must prevail.
We must listen to what Irish people have said.
We must put aside talk of putting them to one side or moving ahead without them, isolating them or blaming them.
We need to listen very carefully and calmly to what Irish people have said and to the problems that they have indicated in terms of neutrality and the whole question of EU militarisation, in terms of democracy and the voice of Ireland and other small nations in Europe, in terms of workers' rights and public services and social Europe.
We need to listen to that.
We need to take the opportunity now to speak to the Irish Government, to listen to the Irish people and to chart a way forward and a text that all can be happy with in the future.
Mr President, I came across two major sentiments during the campaign.
The first was a general feeling that decision-making was being further removed from the citizens in favour of a distant bureaucracy.
The second, possibly more deeply held sentiment was that there was a loss of values.
More accurately, that they were changing.
Ireland had prided itself on Christian values but was finding itself becoming a materialistic nation.
There has been a great deal of disparagement of my country since Friday.
It is as if you feel insulted.
What actually happened was that Ireland decisively said 'no, thank you' to the Lisbon Treaty.
If the response to the democratic will of the people that I have heard in the last five days is outrage, then there is something wrong.
Make no mistake: Ireland is pro-European.
We believe, as obviously you do not, that the project has lost its way.
It has lost sight of the one thing it needs most - democracy - and forgotten the only people that matter - its citizens.
So, before you try to bypass our democratic decision, ask yourself two questions.
One: do you truly believe that this Treaty would survive referendums in the other 26 countries?
And two: is threatening a country for being democratic an action of democracy?
(Applause)
- (NL) Mr President, the longer we go on the more the European mandarins behave like a breed of political autistics, completely closed off from the real world, from the citizens, whom they nevertheless still claim to serve.
Now they are saying that little Ireland does not have the right to oppose a European Treaty, which may soon be ratified by 26 of the 27 Member States.
What arrogance!
Only Ireland has said 'no' after all, because only Ireland has been given the chance to say 'no'.
Everyone knows that the monster of Lisbon, which arose out of the stillborn European Constitution like a Frankenstein monster, would be massively rejected by the electorates of almost all the other Member States if those electorates were given the chance to vote.
In the name of democracy, the result of a democratic election is being booed off the platform and brushed aside.
We are well on the way toward the totalitarian Euro-Nazi state.
(SL) The decision of the Irish people was democratic and we respect it, and there is no need to appeal to us democrats to show respect.
There is no doubt about this, yet it is not enough for us to respect it, we must be aware of the consequences and must understand in the Irish and European context why the majority in one of the most successful Member States of the European Union turned against a Treaty which last year, Heads of State - including that of Ireland - or Government signed with the intention of providing an effective joint response to difficult new challenges, be they in relation to the environment, energy, migration or health.
I agree that we need to take time to ponder, but this should not apply to continued ratification.
Continued ratification requires no further reflection, and the process needs to be continued.
This involves not only Ireland and the entire current European Union, but also the future of Europe, which is not yet entirely united.
In this context I congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on all its successes in the approximation of the countries of the Western Balkans, and especially for the stabilisation and association agreements with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There we must be happy with every step forward in the spirit of the European perspective and there we need to eradicate all sources of conflict development, something made possible by the European perspective.
I recommend that we are tireless.
I hope that the victory of pro-European forces in Macedonia will help the Council towards a decision on the commencement of negotiations with that country, which is already a candidate and has spent a long time in the waiting room.
I also hope that the new Macedonian Government, which has been given a strong mandate, will take advantage of this new confidence in a policy that will reinforce developments towards opening negotiations.
(DE) Mr President, what I want from the European Council tomorrow is some clear self-criticism: self-criticism for its abject failure to communicate and inform the people about this new European treaty.
It really is staggering that the governments negotiate treaties and even hold elaborate signing ceremonies, and then go back to their capitals and give them no further thought.
That is a major cause of the furore that we have experienced in the past and are now facing with Ireland.
(Applause)
I want to see some lessons learned: the Council must finally abandon its blocking tactics and initiate a joint communication or PR strategy with the Commission and Parliament so that we can genuinely take citizens with us on our journey to Europe instead of leaving them by the wayside.
At present, these institutions are behaving like parents who bring a child into the world and then dump it in the gutter and forget about it.
That is simply unacceptable.
We must now take the consequences, and that means forging a common communication and information policy, which is also part of the democratic process.
That is the basis for democracy, so that people understand what Europe is about and see that they are part of the process.
I will gladly listen to the messages sent by the people of Ireland, but when Mrs Sinnott tells us, as she did yesterday, that a majority of voters in one town voted against the Treaty of Lisbon because a waste incineration plant is being built there and we have a European law which calls for the incineration of waste, then I really do wonder what this has to do with the Treaty of Lisbon.
We have heard many such arguments, and we have to be honest about it: not all of them are relevant and deserve to be considered.
We need to think about a new formula for the ratification of European treaties.
Every country must be able to express its views, and I hope that this afternoon, the House of Lords will ratify the Treaty and send out a clear signal that the process is continuing.
Mr President, this afternoon the British Parliament at Westminster will complete the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty.
It will be refreshing to read the press tomorrow to see finally that Britain says 'yes' to Europe.
It will do much to restore the moral authority and the political credibility of the UK and it should assist the Irish to find a new consensus based on less libertas and more veritas.
It is bizarre that Mr Farage and his right-wing troops here prefer to let a referendum in a foreign country take a decision on behalf of, and in place of, the British sovereign Parliament.
It confirms my opinion that the plebiscite is a form of democracy, possibly suited for revolutionary circumstances, but completely unsuited for informed and deliberative decisions on complex treaty revision.
That is why this Parliament must assist the Council to deliver the content of the Lisbon Treaty.
Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty is dead.
Without unanimity that is simply a legal fact.
Voters, not just in Ireland but in France and the Netherlands too, have said 'no' to the Treaty text or its twin brother.
To regain the confidence of our peoples, we must do more than just re-badge and rename the Lisbon text and try to push ahead.
The new Treaty was too easy to ridicule and too complex and obscure to explain, making it difficult for 'yes' campaigners in any country in a referendum.
Many of the changes which were provided for in this Treaty were good, even necessary, but couched in such obscure, incomprehensible language that hardly anyone could understand.
It is up to the other eight Member States to decide whether and how to continue with ratification, but I think that it would be very helpful if, for example, the UK were to decide to do so by referendum and let us see whether we have the confidence of the people to continue with this process.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the Irish referendum is unimportant and inconsequential, why was it held?
Why was it decided to offer this opportunity of a plebiscite, as we have heard?
It is a serious business when a parliament denies the possibility and the importance of allowing people to express themselves with total freedom, as the Irish people have done.
This vote is quite simply a fine tombstone, topped by a Celtic cross, for the prospect of a European superstate which our populations so dislike.
They dislike the selling-off of political and also monetary sovereignty.
Well, it is a state of affairs which gives hope to those of us who, like the Irish people, firmly believe in a Europe of peoples and regions.
For this reason we in Padania likewise call for a referendum, even though in legal terms of course the treaty has now been repudiated, killed off.
It has been killed off by this unbelievable procedure of having a treaty that affects the future of our peoples approved by means of a parliamentary vote, excluding the people and citizens.
Fortunately there is one free nation that has a sense of its own freedom in its DNA.
Perhaps that strength comes from having had to fight for freedom.
It is now time to state the true significance of this vote: it says 'enough is enough' to the Brussels Eurocrats who want to build a superstate far removed from the interest and soul of our citizens.
We in Padania all feel Irish today.
(CS) Mr President, after the Irish referendum, Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group, is scolding us, the citizens of small Member States, in particular Ireland and the Czech Republic, with the typical German haughty arrogance.
According to him, when such small countries block the common reform process, we have to ask whether they want to stay in the Union or not.
Let me assure you, Mr President (and you can pass this on, Mr Schulz), that now that the Irish have killed this sick product of the German Presidency that is called the Lisbon Treaty, the Czechs will be happy to bury it and still remain a Member State.
They will bury it because it contains the Charter and so, for the first time in 60 years, opens the door in our country to the restitution of the Sudetenland property, and to the revision of the just outcome of the Second World War rather than the so-called Beneš Decrees. They will also bury it because it deprives small Member States of their right of veto and increases the German voting power from 9 votes to 18 votes instead.
Mr Schulz would do better if he asked himself what the outcome would have been in Germany had the Lisbon Treaty been put to the German people in a referendum.
I congratulate the Irish and all of us.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, admitting that the Lisbon Treaty is dead and that it was a blind alley is the only democratic and honest solution.
Tomorrow, the heads of state should acknowledge at last that in democracies politics is not made over foie gras in air-conditioned halls, and stop trying to manage the lives of other people from Brussels.
The Irish referendum clearly shows that people are not willing to suffer decisions from above and the arrogance employed by the Union's power elite.
The Council must make the decision-making process accessible to the public and stop deceiving the citizens.
Are we not able to learn from our history?
After all the bloody events of the 20th century, does the political elite really want the big countries to make decisions for the smaller ones again?
Was it not enough for some prime ministers and presidents to have lived a substantial part of their lives in a totalitarian regime?
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the Council should brush up on the basics: why the Union was created and on what values was it built.
It should respect the law and the rules, and immediately declare that further ratification of the now dead Lisbon Treaty is a completely useless exercise.
Mr President, if you are looking to me to make sense of the Irish vote on the Lisbon Treaty, look away: I cannot.
But while I am deeply disappointed with the result, of one thing I am sure: we must accept it as the democratic will of the people and respect it.
What a turn-up for the history books, as I look behind me here today to see a motley collection of extreme right-wing British colleagues, including Jim Allister and the odd British jailbird thrown in for good measure, all donning the green jersey, demanding respect for the Irish vote.
(Protests from certain members of the IND/DEM Group)
How the history books could have been written differently if respect for the Irish vote from British colleagues was always there!
How things could have been different!
How many lives could have been saved!
I welcome it - albeit very late.
We must all respect the Irish vote.
(Protests in the background)
He had a lot of time practising behind bars; maybe he could shut up now for a moment...
(Applause)
One of the Irish Members in this House, who has already spoken this morning, distributed leaflets during the campaign with a syringe on them.
Perhaps she could tell this House where in the Lisbon Treaty euthanasia is provided for, where in the Lisbon Treaty abortion, prostitution, corporate tax decision, risks to the Irish neutrality lie.
I await the truth.
The Irish Government must analyse the outcome calmly, to establish exactly what happened within the Treaty text that our electorate voted against, and they must provide answers acceptable not just to naysayers in Ireland but also to all other Member State governments and their citizens who, in my opinion, are also entitled to have their say and express their position, and we must respect that also.
A measured response to the genuine concerns of the Irish electorate is called for, but we must not appease the extremists.
When the dust settles, I hope colleagues will agree with me that a two-speed Europe is not the answer but the beginning of the end of our Union, the most successful democratic peace project of our time.
It has always been easier to peddle fear than hope.
A famous Irish politician, one of our own - James Dillon - once said: 'a lie well told and told often enough, I am damned if the truth would ever catch up with it'.
It did not.
We failed to distinguish fact from fiction in the minds of a sufficient number of our electorate, despite the valiant efforts of our Director of Elections, Gay Mitchell, and my colleagues.
It is now up to our new Taoiseach, who has had an inauspicious start, to come up with a solution.
(Applause)
Mr President, we must indeed not just listen to the Irish result but reflect and digest it.
But, as has been said, we must also listen to the other 26 countries, their results and also concerns that may be expressed during their ratification.
And then we must rise to the enormous challenge of bridging the gap.
If we do obtain 26 ratifications and one rejection, it is neither unreasonable nor undemocratic to ask the one whether they could consider the possibility of adjusting the reform package, reviewing it, explaining it better, perhaps seeking a new compromise rather than block all reform.
There is nothing unreasonable or undemocratic about that.
After all, even some of the 'no' campaigners in Ireland professed they claimed their intention was to renegotiate and seek a better agreement.
Some people - and we have heard that from some parts of this House - only want to listen to one side, to the answer that they like, which is the answer 'no'.
I want to listen to both sides and then find a solution acceptable to all 27 countries.
That is the challenge we must all rise to.
(FR) Mr President, it is obviously never a secondary event when people say 'no' when they are asked about the future of Europe, and we cannot, and must not, ignore this 'no'.
On the contrary, we have to face it head on and try to respond to it.
As far as I am concerned, there are two questions that we must tackle.
The first relates to democracy.
The citizens expect Europe to offer legibility, visibility, comprehension, explanations, education, support.
This question affects everyone, not just the national governments.
It also applies to the European institutions, especially the Commission and the Council.
That is the first question.
The second relates to the sense of Europe, its soul, and, as Martin Schulz just mentioned, its raison d'être.
Why did we build Europe?
That cannot boil down simply to market issues.
We did not build Europe for competition alone; we are together for values, we have a project for society, we have a model of society - economic, social, sustainable, human - and that model deserves to be taken up, carried forward and defended.
That is what our fellow citizens expect.
The world has changed a great deal since the Treaty of Rome.
We must go back to the drawing board and lay new foundations for the European project so that it responds to the crises currently facing us - financial crisis, food crisis, energy crisis - but also responds to the considerable problems we must tackle.
How can we create, how can we design growth that is better quality, more sustainable and more just?
How can we reduce inequalities?
How can we achieve a new global balance?
How can we rethink the issue of developing countries and, in particular, their self-sufficiency?
Those are the questions that we need to answer and I think that now more than ever it is at last time for Europe to get back to politics.
(DA) Mr President, a prominent, popular Danish businessman wrote the following in yesterday's Berlingske Tidende newspaper: 'Europeans fully support international political cooperation and global responsibility.
When EU citizens declare their support for democracy at national level, they of course also support democracy in a European context, and that is exactly what they are not getting'.
We have been given repeated assurances that the Treaty of Lisbon cannot enter into force if even one country has rejected it, yet what did Mr Pöttering write in his statement of 13 June?
(DE) 'The rejection of the Treaty text by one European Union country cannot mean that the ratifications which have already been carried out by 18 EU countries become invalid.'
(DA) In the age of absolutism, kings and emperors met to agree on the division of power among themselves.
Those days have returned.
Prince Pöttering, Emperor Barroso and the rulers of their vassal states have decided that Europe's citizens do not matter.
Twenty-six countries were not allowed to vote, and the one country that did vote, Ireland, has discovered that it meant nothing.
The Union has no popular mandate.
(DA) Mr President, last Friday, the Irish voted 'no' to the Treaty of Lisbon, a poor copy of the Constitution to which France and the Netherlands also voted 'no'.
Nevertheless, the Commission President says that ratification is to continue.
We are told that one country's scepticism cannot put the brakes on development.
It is being made to look as though there is a problem with the Irish people.
But there is not.
The gulf is not between the Irish people and Europe; it is between the people and the Heads of State or Government of Europe.
The gulf is not between certain European countries and the rest of Europe.
France, the Netherlands and Ireland do not wish to put the brakes on development; they wish for development of a different kind.
Why is that so hard to understand?
As for Mr Schulz, I would say to him, 'shame on you'.
You compare what you call 'anti-Europeans' to fascists, but it is your rhetoric that is fascist.
You say that anti-Europeans ran up and down steps, went out canvassing.
It does not take much historical awareness to remember what was said about black people in the last century.
This is a disgrace!
Shame on you!
(DE) Mr President, the Irish people have said 'no' to the Treaty, and the EU grandees' response was to infuriate the Irish by summoning the Taoiseach to the European Council in order to give an account of their 'misconduct'.
This is childish and unworthy of the founding fathers' European vision.
It is even more shortsighted, however, to demand Ireland's exclusion or attempt to push the Treaty through.
If we repeat the vote until the desired outcome is achieved, that really will inflict irreparable damage on Europe's image.
We have held 290 referenda in Europe since 1990, and yet there are no referenda on fundamental decisions of major importance such as Turkey's accession or the introduction of the euro, and now we are not being given a say on something as important as the Lisbon Treaty.
Brussels' understanding of what constitutes democracy - whereby citizens are simply expected to give their blessing to EU decisions or vote for the parties that the EU approves of - really is reminiscent of the Soviet Union.
Instead of taking umbrage, the EU should accept the Irish 'no' vote for what it is: a chance for a new direction, towards policies which are geared to the people and the citizens of Europe.
(DE) Mr President, as Martin Schulz has kindly pointed out, there are indeed many heads of government from the PPE-DE, and that reflects the fact that the PPE-DE is closer to citizens and therefore wins more elections.
Nonetheless, the fact of the matter is that there are a number of indications that we need to strike a balance between rational economic policy and social policy.
I fully respect the outcome of the Irish referendum.
What I do not respect, however, are the campaigns of lies conducted by certain people on the left and the right in an attempt to mislead the people and set them against this united Europe: a united Europe which is the most successful concept in the history of this continent, one which has achieved peace, freedom and prosperity.
(Applause)
What we must recognise is that this Europe is of particular benefit to the smaller nations.
They sit with us around the table, they hold seats in this Parliament, and nothing can be decided in Europe without their say-so, whereas previously, the large nations were able to ride rough-shod over the smaller ones.
That is the difference: in our Europe, all the nations are equal, and that is what you are trying to destroy, Mr Farage, with your British imperialist notions!
We need this Treaty so that enlargement can function effectively and so that we can achieve more democracy, by closing the democratic gap and strengthening the national parliaments.
We need this Treaty to safeguard the subsidiarity clause and to enable us to master the challenges of the future, from the energy crisis to organised crime, and give us the capacities to respond to food and oil prices and other similar challenges.
All this will be destroyed if we do not equip ourselves with the instruments provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, especially those pertaining to social rights, namely the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the 'social clause', which states that social issues must be taken into account when defining and implementing all policies.
Twenty-six Member States can now ratify the Treaty, and every one has undertaken to do so.
It was the United Kingdom which taught me that in a representative democracy, Parliament can speak for the people, and I will not let UKIP destroy what I have learned from the UK.
These 26 Member States can ratify the Treaty through a parliamentary process, and if that process is brought to a successful conclusion, the Irish people can then reconsider.
We will expect some proposals from Ireland to preserve the cohesion of our Community of 27, because I do not want to see a divided Europe and I do not want to see a core Europe.
I want to see a Europe which remains a unity of equals, with 27 countries, and that is why I support the Treaty of Lisbon.
Mr President, I am less diplomatic than most of my colleagues in this House.
The fact is that lies, damn lies and statistics defeated the truth in the Irish referendum.
Lisbon is not dead.
Nevertheless, the choice made in Ireland is a sovereign decision of the Irish people.
The only people who can vary that decision on that Treaty are the Irish people.
Whether that happens or not depends on the discussions that will begin tomorrow between the Irish Government and the other 26 heads of state.
There is no magic wand.
It will take time to reach conclusions.
I propose a new deadline for ratification of Lisbon.
I think that setting it before the European elections is a reasonable target.
If the Irish people continue to be dissatisfied with Lisbon in whatever form it is finally agreed between us and the rest of Europe, then Ireland will have no option but to renegotiate its relationship with the Union.
That would be a disastrous course for our country.
Europe has very little to lose if it loses Ireland, but Ireland has everything to lose if it loses Europe.
The global challenges we all face in this constantly changing and inter-connected world are clear: climate change, demographic change, migration and energy crisis, hunger and poverty killing millions, human insecurity, international crime, topped by an identity crisis in virtually every one of our Member States.
These cannot be solved by any Member State pulling the shutters down and hoping these will go away.
To conclude, could I urge that Europe demonstrate tangible capacity to deliver decent living and working conditions?
That will reinforce our unity and our solidarity and produce a positive solution to this crisis.
(Applause)
Mr President, allow yourself to think: if the Irish had voted 'yes', does anyone here believe that our green T-shirts would have had the text 'Respect the Irish vote'?
The truth is that they neither respect the Irish, nor democracy.
They only respect a 'no', and that is quite unique.
When Sweden entered the European Union, there were 12 Member States.
It was 1995.
Today there are 27 Member States.
That is quite a change, and I think very few can question that Europe has become much, much better because of this enlargement and this magnitude of development.
We can say today, when we are discussing the Irish referendum, that those who were saying 'no' all the time were wrong all the time, and we who advocated a future development of the European Union have been proved to be right.
So let us proceed in the same way in which we have achieved those results, with persistence, vision, democracy and respect for each Member State.
Let us proceed with democracy in each Member State with a ratification process, but also respect the decision of each Member State, while also remembering persistence.
We need to go further regarding the energy market, the internal market and how to achieve better results in all areas, but also to understand that the Nice Treaty is not enough if we are to proceed with the same development and the same visions with which we have achieved so much.
So let us proceed and let us be the Europe that says 'yes'.
Let us remember that the 'no' people have achieved nothing in this Europe.
(Applause)
(SL) This is not a new discussion.
We already had a similar discussion when voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the Constitutional Treaty and at that time the Commission and Council assured us that the ratification process would carry on, but then both of them, along with our Parliament, yielded to the temptation to halt that ratification process.
Today, despite our respect for the decision of Irish voters, I would stand in favour of not halting this ratification process now and of seeing it through to the end.
I think that in this case it will be easier to find solutions for accepting the Lisbon Treaty than if we once again yield to temptation and halt the process because of one referendum.
Secondly, something needs to be crystal clear to us: there exists a major gulf in the perception of the importance of the European Union between the political elite at home, in national circles, in the European Union and among the majority of our citizens.
Here we must ask ourselves whether Parliament, the Council and the European Commission can do anything more to bridge this communication gulf and once again inspire our people with the European idea.
I believe that in welcoming the plans of the Slovenian Presidency for tomorrow's Council I would propose that it also discusses this - a new communication strategy for dialogue between citizens and the European Union - not just with a view to concluding the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but also in other respects.
(Applause)
Mr President, there has been talk here today of respect and there is no doubt that we have to respect the result of the referendum held in Ireland, in which some people voted 'yes' and some people voted 'no'.
I think we all agree that we must respect the remaining countries and, therefore, continue with ratification.
However, I want to talk about respect for democracy and I want to state clearly that approval by the people has the same value as parliamentary approval; exactly the same value.
We must remember the first 'r': respect.
The second 'r' is reflection.
We have to look at the reasons that led to the 'no' vote in Ireland, we have to endeavour to explain why the Lisbon Treaty is better than the current Treaties and we have to do so with facts and figures.
We have to explain to the people that - like the Irish horse that won the Epsom Derby a few days ago, called New Approach - the Lisbon Treaty is also a 'new approach', which Europe needs to offer added value to its people.
After that reflection, the third 'r' is resolution.
We must find a solution, and in that respect let me completely clear: some of the 'no' supporters used a lethal and shameful argument.
They said: 'vote "no” and then we will renegotiate the Lisbon Treaty with advantages for Ireland'.
I want to state clearly here that Europe is a community of rights, where the mood of society reigns and decisions must be respected.
We in the European Parliament are stating clearly that there will be no renegotiation of the Lisbon Treaty: Europeans and this Parliament believe that that point is essential for Europe to move forward.
Those of us who are in favour of the Treaty want to build on what we have.
My question is: what alternative is put forward by those who want a 'no' vote?
I would like them to explain it to me.
(FR) Mr President, it is now 18 June and as a Frenchman I am consumed with the call from London: resist, continue, persevere and never give up.
The word 'veto' is written with the same four letters as the word 'vote', but there is no veto for the others so we must continue.
Having said that, it is the sixth 'no' in nine referendums since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
That raises questions.
It is said that Europe is not social enough; it will never be social enough.
It is not democratic enough; it will remain imperfect.
It is too bureaucratic; there will always be technicians who are called technocrats.
I think that it is experiencing a terrible identity crisis.
Things were simpler before.
Today, it is a bit all over the place; it is no longer too sure of its meaning, its history, its destiny, and that is what we need to tackle.
To do so we need great leadership and from that point of view we are somewhat on our own.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that in actual fact - as the President-in-Office and President Barroso have both said - tomorrow's European Council meeting has a number of items on its agenda, and not just the result of the referendum in Ireland.
Obviously, however, this issue has taken up practically all of this morning's debate.
It is a significant matter.
Various reasons have been given and analysed as to why the Irish people responded as they did: in actual fact, by only a narrow margin over the yes vote.
A good deal has been said, but I believe that we must address ourselves in a practical manner to why the Irish response was what it was, and then decide how to proceed.
I repeat, a good deal has been said, but I think the answer lies in the fact that Europe's citizens lack information.
Everyone is at fault: we share the blame; the governments are to blame.
In general terms it has been said - and I agree - that governments take credit when things go right, but when things go wrong or there are grounds for criticism, Europe is always to blame.
That is absolutely true.
Nevertheless, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, nobody is forcing anybody to remain in Europe.
In my opinion we must respect the outcome of the Irish referendum.
We must however equally respect the wishes of the other 26 Member States; 18 at present but soon to be 26.
No one should be forced, as it were, to remain inside a cage they do not like.
Europe must go forward;
Europe cannot stand still.
I am winding up, Mr President.
Tomorrow, in my opinion, the European Council must take a clear decision on a new strategy - the heads of state and government can do so - a new strategy whereby those wishing to remain on board may remain on board, but Europe has to move ahead in the general interest.
Mr President, I presume that the leader of the UK Independence Party's obsession with fraudsters is because of his own party's intimate relationship with fraud and fraudsters.
To return to the main point of the debate: clearly the Lisbon Treaty cannot come into force on 1 January as we hoped.
We have to wait for the Irish Government to tell us how they think we should proceed.
But meanwhile other states should exercise their sovereign right to ratify this Treaty.
My own Member State will finish its ratification today in accordance with its long-standing and widely respected parliamentary tradition.
Meanwhile globalisation continues apace and with it the insecurity that it generates, which we saw a lot of evidence of in the Irish referendum.
The EU is a political process designed to deal with those issues so that is what we should be doing: looking at the Millennium Development Goals, at climate change, at migration.
What action?
That is why I am going to avoid too much introverted institutional navel-gazing and think about action to improve the lot of our citizens.
I have one question though for the Slovenian presidency: could you tell me what are the implications of the Irish vote for Croatia's accession to the European Union?
(PL) Mr President, we are discussing preparations for the European Council.
I do of course consider that all the Members who have taken the floor are right from the point of view of some larger or smaller group of Europeans.
We should bear in mind, however, that if this debate had taken place on Wednesday of last week, it would have been quite different.
We would certainly not have been debating the problem of the Lisbon Treaty.
Instead, we would be discussing the everyday problems of the people of Europe.
As things stand, the citizens of the European Union are not particularly concerned about the rejection of the Treaty by the people of Ireland.
They are much more concerned about the price of petrol at filling stations and about other the problems that are arising every day.
It would be wrong for our discussions today and the outcome of the summit to focus exclusively on the Lisbon Treaty.
We need to realise that as politicians we are currently being called on to deal with two important issues.
One is how to respond to our citizens' everyday expectations, and the other is the Lisbon Treaty and its implementation.
The latter will determine our future capacity to deal with the preoccupations of the people of Europe.
We must therefore try to separate these issues and discuss not only the Lisbon Treaty but also issues that are currently of interest to our citizens.
We need to explain to the citizens why adoption of the treaty and its implementation will make it easier to resolve their everyday problems.
We need to explain why the institutional solutions we propose are good for the European Union.
The proposed arrangements will result in greater solidarity and concern for each other, together with greater respect for what we stand for in each one of our countries.
(SV) I entirely agree that every Member State has the right to have a say.
That is a democratic right.
I am also of the opinion that, in many respects, the Treaty of Lisbon is better than the current Treaty.
That applies to the scope for continued enlargement and to increased openness, but also to employees' rights.
When I visited Ireland and met trade union representatives during the campaign, there was justified concern that the relationship between the market and social rights is currently not in balance.
In Ireland too, there were references to the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Laval and Rüffert cases.
The two most serious consequences are as follows: firstly, equal treatment no longer applies after the judgments.
Those who come from Member States with lower pay levels have to be content with the minimum wage and will not get equal pay.
Secondly, the right to strike has been restricted in a way which is entirely unacceptable.
The Council and the Commission must get to grips with these issues.
It is a question of balance between social Europe and market Europe.
If we do not get this balance right, our people will turn their backs on the EU.
We all have a responsibility here, all three institutions, and we must act quickly.
Mr President, there is no problem as regards respect for the Irish voters but we should have equal respect for the decisions made by 18 democratically elected national parliaments and, further, show equal respect for the remaining eight Member States, to allow them also freely to decide about the Reform Treaty.
With all due respect for the Irish vote, the EU of 27 cannot be taken political hostage by the limited number of opponents to the Lisbon Treaty.
There is no alternative to the EU reform.
Yes, Europe can stop, but the world around us will not stop because of us, and the most dramatic casualty of this vote will be Europe's solidarity: our common foreign and security policy and energy solidarity.
There is also an ethical dimension which we need to address.
This referendum is a wake-up call for a credible commitment to our principal values.
Our citizens may never become fully informed about the details of the Treaties, but they can always be trusted to differentiate between integrity and real commitment on the one hand and half-truths and Realpolitik on the other.
Instead of living from one national election to the next, instead of indulging in consumer democracy geared to getting more and more money from Europe, we need leaders who can make the appeal to our citizens: 'First of all, what can you do for Europe?'
And believe me, if we have such leaders, we will find citizens who will support us.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, six months ago 27 European heads of state or government committed themselves to ratifying the Reform Treaty by attaching their signatures to the document.
I want the European Council to be reminded of that at its meeting on Thursday.
In particular, I want the Czech Prime Minister, Mr Mirek Topolánek, to be reminded of the duty to carry out ratification. He, very much like the Czech President, argues that the Lisbon Treaty is dead and that there is no point in continuing with ratification.
I would especially like to call on prime ministers who belong to the Group of the European People's Party, to remind the Czech Prime Minister of his duty and the responsibility facing a country that is due to assume the presidency.
As the Czech Republic will take over the EU presidency on 1 January 2009, the final chapter of the ratification process, the solution to the entire Lisbon Treaty problem, will lie precisely on that country's shoulders.
I say again that I would like the European People's Party to remind the Czech Prime Minister of this duty.
(RO) The European Council we are preparing today is decisive for the future of Europe.
One of the most prosperous European countries and a representative of economic success by implementing the European integration procedures has said "no” to the Lisbon Treaty.
At the same time, 18 European countries have adopted this document, most of them being the same 18 that also said "yes” to the European Constitutional Treaty.
I am equally disappointed with the result of the referendum in Ireland, just like many of the previous speakers.
Nevertheless, the European Union has to carry on the reforms that are necessary for it.
A Europe with several levels of speed, for which there have been procedures even since the Amsterdam Treaty, and with well-defined exclusion options is the only way in which we can go forward at this moment.
The chance that Ireland had to evolve has to be provided to the countries that have recently joined the EU as well, such as Romania.
In times like these, we have to remember and regroup around the things that unite us and provide us with a reason to go forward.
In his famous speech in favour of the United States of Europe, Sir Winston Churchill said that, if Europe were once united in the sharing of its common inheritance, there would be no limit to the happiness, prosperity and glory which its people could enjoy.
I believe in this vision and, at the same time, I know that great efforts are required for its achievement.
Yet, this should not stop us from carrying on.
(DE) Mr President, we need improvements, not justifications!
Nonetheless, the point must be made very clearly that it is the national governments which bear most of the responsibility for the public's mood towards the EU in our Member States.
One thing needs to come out of the EU Summit tomorrow and the day after: an apology from the heads of state and government to the citizens in their Member States for their lack of honesty in relation to Community decisions, for failing to provide the public with adequate information, for failing to communicate with them, and for the lack of courage and integrity about their share of the responsibility for decisions in Europe.
European policy is domestic policy.
It must therefore be an integral element of governments' information and communications policy.
Making the European Union the scapegoat for every problem instead of facing up to their responsibility, and then asking citizens, two weeks before a referendum, to give their endorsement is dishonest, irresponsible and disingenuous.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a need for improvement here.
Mr President, the Irish 'no' vote indicates that an unprecedented and successful experiment in world politics, the EU, is in difficulty.
But, in order to be truly indicative of the will of the people, any referendum should be preceded by a campaign of information.
In the Irish case we can measure that by the degree of correspondence, or total lack of it, between the Lisbon Treaty and the arguments invoked against it.
Of course democracy compels us to take the Irish result into account, which we do.
But, equally, democracy cannot be exercised at the expense of the rights of the others, namely those who have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty, and, most important, it cannot be abused to blackmail the majority by a minority.
I am afraid that the Irish 'no' will encourage rather than discourage existing tendencies to renationalise some common policies by prolonging the juridical vacuum the EU finds itself in since the rejection of the constitutional treaty.
I would conclude by saying that, as an MEP from a former Communist country which made great efforts to be admitted to the Union, I would hate to see communism living longer than the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, it would appear that all agreements reached in Lisbon are doomed.
The Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon Treaty have both ended in a fiasco.
Last week Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum.
This means the document is now dead.
The forthcoming summit will have to determine whether there is any hope of reviving the Treaty.
The European Parliament should send out a clear signal that it accepts the rules of democracy even though some Members may be unhappy with the outcome.
Insulting and coercing the people of Ireland is unacceptable.
One way of exerting acceptable pressure would be to continue the process of ratifying the Treaty in other countries.
The extreme and irresponsible comments raising the possibility of excluding such a supposedly arrogant country from the Union are cause for alarm.
We hope that the European Council will consider a new and more democratic formula for the European Union.
(FR) Mr President, we all know that democracy is not a long calm river, but we also know that it is democracy that we have chosen to organise our society.
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the Irish 'no' is no different to the French 'no' or the Dutch 'no' but, as in 2005, we were unable to explain why Europe is good for our citizens.
We were unable to reassure them with regard to the ecological crisis that is hitting them head-on.
However, I do not agree with speculation and I believe that we should wait until the end of the ratifications.
Nonetheless, I would ask the Council to send a strong signal to the citizens to show that there is a genuine desire for transparency and a desire to reinforce democracy in relation to our fellow citizens.
I would ask the Council to open its doors and I would ask that the Commission and Council Presidencies be appointed at the same time as the European elections.
Yes, that would be a strong signal and we do not require ratification of the Treaty to make that type of change.
Mr President, this is a lively debate and one that I have listened to very carefully.
Yes, the Irish have spoken and they have said 'no'.
But one of the things that worries me deeply is that those who voted 'no' felt there were no risks in doing so: they felt, perhaps, the status quo would prevail.
Now it is very clear from this debate that other countries believe that their process of ratification through parliament is equally valid and that that will proceed.
So there will be some sort of dilemma for Ireland and the Irish to look at the situation if 26 ratify and there is urgency for our Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, to come forward in the next few days with certainly a reflection, and perhaps proposals, on the way forward.
Could I address specifically Kathy Sinnott who campaigned, in my view, with some rather horrendous arguments for a 'no' vote?
Could I say to her, concerning this worry about loss of values in Ireland, that we cannot blame Europe for the loss of values in Ireland.
We have done that ourselves, and let us stop throwing the buck at the European Union and maybe look at our own values of materialism in Ireland and elsewhere.
(PL) Mr President, I firmly believe that the process of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty should continue.
For the countries that signed the document, this is an international legal duty, pursuant to the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties.
The treaty provides an opportunity for essential reforms to the Union.
For example, it will make it possible for a common energy policy to be created in Europe.
Such a policy is very important for the Union and also for my country, Poland.
It would guarantee energy security for all my fellow citizens.
I represent Silesia, which has a population of five million.
For my region, such a policy would be an opportunity for progress and development, as Silesia is rich in energy resources.
I therefore pose the question: is all this to be thwarted by the Irish 'no'?
I respect the result of the referendum in Ireland, but at the same time I find it hard to accept that the votes of 109 964 Irish people, which represent the difference between the 'no' and the 'yes' votes, should be able to determine the future of my country, my region and essentially the future of the European Union.
I do not think that this should be allowed to happen.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the people of Ireland and also to the CAEUC, which campaigned against the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland.
There have now been three rejections of this Treaty: one in France, one in the Netherlands and now the rejection of a slightly modified version of the Treaty in Ireland.
We really do have to accept this at last.
I am reminded of Bertolt Brecht, who once said: 'Would it not be easier in that case for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?'
That is my understanding of a number of statements that have been made here.
The substance of the Treaty was indeed debated in Ireland, especially its neoliberal orientation, its focus on militarisation, and above all, its undemocratic character.
We really should just accept this vote.
The Treaty is dead and we need a different Treaty.
For our part, we will certainly be noting and documenting the various undemocratic statements that have been made here.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) The word heard - and read - most frequently in this Chamber today has been 'respect'.
I trust you will permit me to add that we must also respect certain facts, and I would like to highlight the following.
Firstly: ratification of a new treaty on European Union falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States.
Exclusive.
The Council has absolutely no role in these processes, and the Presidency even less.
Next fact: each Member State carries out this process in accordance with its own rules, which that State formulates in its own independent and sovereign way.
This brings us perhaps to the essential point.
Certain Member States have carried out parliamentary ratification or will do so, and one is bound by a referendum.
Yet this does not mean that there is anything wrong with parliamentary ratification.
I firmly reject the assertions of those who believe that parliamentary ratification is imperfect or less democratic than a referendum.
This is not true.
This is not true.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with parliamentary ratification.
From the viewpoint of the European Union it is entirely equal to other democratic processes.
Third fact: each Member State speaks for itself.
The Irish voters spoke for Ireland.
They did not speak for any other Member State.
This means that every other Member State has exactly the same right.
Eighteen Member States have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty, the others have not yet made a pronouncement, and the view of the Presidency is that ratifications must continue.
Those who claim that the Lisbon Treaty is dead, those who are demanding an immediate halt to the ratification process, are denying the right of Member States to speak for themselves, the same right that they are so vehemently defending in the case of Ireland.
(Applause)
Fourth fact: we have already been in this situation and we found a solution.
In this case, too, we will find one, based on the reasons why this situation arose, but the Presidency does not wish to speculate on this.
The Presidency does not wish to get dragged into a discussion of whether perhaps the Treaty was too complicated, whether there was something wrong with the communication, or whether perhaps, as Mr De Rossa stressed, a great many lies were told.
No, we will leave it to our Irish colleagues to analyse the reasons for such an outcome and also to propose their vision of a possible way out.
And we will find that way out, of this I am certain.
We will find it.
And the European Council meeting tomorrow marks the start of our search for the way out.
And the final fact: the item on the agenda for today's morning sitting was not the result of the Irish referendum, but preparations for the European Council.
The Presidency will conduct the discussion in the European Council in this way to make it clear that Europe has not ground to a halt, that Europe continues to function, and for this reason we will be addressing numerous other topics in line with the planned agenda.
We will address the problem of food and oil prices, we will address economic, social and environmental topics, we will address international development challenges and we will address the issue of the Western Balkans.
Here I would also like to respond to Mr Titley - there are no direct implications for the European Union's enlargement policy, which will continue, as will the European Neighbourhood Policy and other policies.
Thank you to everyone, and especially to those who gave their views on these other topics, and I am confident that the European Council will progress successfully.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for all their very interesting contributions.
Of course this is the right arena for a debate on democracy and respect for votes.
The Irish voted 'no', so why is it then not over?
Why does the EU not just say, 'The Treaty is dead: let us move on'?
Why is it that some people and some Member States insist on carrying out their own ratification procedures?
Why is it that we insist on coming back to the reasons why we started this whole debate on a new treaty for the European Union?
I hope you will allow me to say a few words about this because, do not forget, the European leaders have invested a lot of political capital in this whole procedure.
It has taken a long time and a lot of energy to discuss the underlying issues and the problems behind the need for a new Treaty to design a new machinery for a European Union that has changed so dramatically in a short period of time.
Let me just mention three reasons why we think a new treaty is needed.
Firstly, it would give the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding force.
Europe is not only about the internal market - as somebody said here - but also about the rights of persons and the rights of workers.
A second reason is, of course, that we would like to be able to speak with one single strong voice in the world, to be stronger on the international scene, and to do that on the basis of our values.
We would like to stand up on the international scene, to fight for sustainable development, to discuss oil prices, conflict prevention and other important issues.
This is one of the reasons behind the discussion on a new treaty.
The third reason is, of course, to make the European Union more democratic.
How ironic it is, for those who talk about respecting the 'no' and about the outcome, that the Treaty would actually give more power to the directly elected European Parliament.
It would mean more involvement of the national parliaments and would mean that the Council has to hold its deliberations in public, with the Citizens' Initiative as one of the important elements in a chapter on participatory democracy, which is a new improvement in the Treaty.
The T-shirt party up there have the text 'Respect the "no”'.
My idea of doing that includes knowing the concerns of the Irish people.
It is understanding why they voted 'no'.
They have made their own interpretations but I think it is very important that the Irish Government, with the help of our Eurobarometer opinion polls, can better understand what the concerns are and whether we can do something about them.
Is that not the idea of democracy?
That is the way forward - to understand their arguments, to work with the other Member States and also to get their respect for the problems that we can, hopefully, solve together.
As we did after the 'no' vote in the French and Dutch referendums, we have already carried out a Eurobarometer survey, which I think will also help better to understand the challenges of any referendum.
Carrying out a referendum has its upsides but also its downsides - or rather, from a democratic point of view, challenges.
After the voters have been presented with such a complex wide text as a new international treaty, of course there is room for different interpretations of the results.
We need to understand better what the Irish said, what they are afraid of and what they hope for.
I already understand from the preliminary results that this is not a general 'no' to Europe.
It is also understanding and respecting their role in a European Union.
The upside of carrying out a referendum is that you also have to inform and communicate with citizens, with all the challenges that implies.
I think that everybody can see that we also have to analyse what we can improve in terms of communication and information to citizens.
I have always said that communication is a tool for democracy.
This must be based on a right for citizens to know what goes on at European level, what is decided and how citizens can have a say.
That work has to be further intensified and that is why also the Commission will continue with what we started a couple of years ago, called Plan 'D', as in Debate, Dialogue and Democracy.
That will be based on the idea of having a citizens' ownership of EU policies...
Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that there is a bit of a hubbub because a lot of colleagues are entering the chamber, but I would ask those entering not to stand chatting because many colleagues are keen to hear the Commissioner's conclusions.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am trying to summarise that we need to create a citizen's ownership of EU policies, to make them understandable and relevant, and to make the EU institutions accountable and reliable to those they serve.
We need to have a broad and permanent debate on the future of the European Union between the democratic institutions in the EU and the citizens, both at national and EU level, and we need to empower citizens by giving them access to information so that they can have an informed debate on the European Union.
We have already proposed creating a framework for that, as Jo Leinen has already pointed to - and thank you for doing so.
I thank Mr Lenarčič for trying to find a solution to that.
I thank Parliament for its support in trying to be more effective in communicating with citizens, because then we have to be serious about it and give it the resources and the framework we need to work in partnership with Member States as well and, of course, to make our texts and our decisions as readable as possible.
We had a debate on the consolidated Treaty.
It took the Council too long to accept and to publish a consolidated Treaty, but in the end it did so, and this is, of course, one tool with which we are able to reach out in a better way to our citizens.
We have to continue to draw conclusions and learn the lessons also from the Irish example, but to respect the 'no' vote.
We do that best by actually knowing what were their concerns, by finding the solutions together and allowing the other Member States also to have their say.
I hope that this debate will also serve as an input to the leaders' meeting tomorrow and on Friday.
I thank you very much for a good and constructive debate.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I wish to inform the House that Mr Hans-Peter Martin has asked to make a personal statement under Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure.
As provided for in Rule 145, I shall give Mr Martin the floor when the minutes of this sitting are considered for approval.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - I heartily congratulate the voters of the Republic Of Ireland on convincingly rejecting the repackaged Constitution.
In so doing they struck a blow for millions of democrats across Europe, who were denied a say by the totalitarian attempt of the EU elite to foist the Lisbon Treaty on us all.
The challenge is now whether some elite have the honestly and integrity to admit that the Treaty is dead.
Lisbon sets its own test for survival: unanimous ratification.
It spectacularly failed that test.
Like its predecessor, the Constitution, it foundered on the rock of democracy.
Rather than face reality, I fear that we will again face a Brussels conspiracy to circumvent the people.
If you do, you will ultimately face the same fate.
So save yourselves the trouble and admit that the Treaty is dead, with no prospect of resurrection.
in writing. - In these times of crisis and institutional uncertainty I feel I must praise the Treaty of Lisbon.
I do not know if it will ever enter into force, but if one wanted to avoid populism he should say that it is a good treaty.
Of course it was not as democratically constructed and discussed as the Constitutional Treaty.
Of course it is not the perfect text - there is no perfect text.
Of course it is too complex - but which European Treaty is not?
People who say they do not understand it in fact show they have no confidence in their leaders.
But it is a text that advances democracy in Europe.
It would make Europe more open, efficient and socially sensitive.
One simple example: were it in force, were the Charter of Fundamental Rights in force, the Court of Justice could not have taken the Viking and Laval decisions, which are so detrimental for workers.
So we need more Europe, not less.
More democracy.
More politics.
As socialists, we now have the duty to go before the people and explain what kind of new and different Europe we want.
in writing. - (HU) I am one of those people who think that things in Europe will no longer be the same as they were before the Irish 'no' vote.
One thing we certainly cannot do is to ignore the outcome of the Irish referendum.
I am also one of those people, however, who believe that we must continue with the ratification process; every Member State has the same right to express its opinion on the common future of Europe.
We need to solve this complicated puzzle on the one hand by listening to the voice of the Irish citizens, and on the other by giving due consideration to the position of all the other Member States that want to move ahead along the common European road.
The equation is a difficult one, and we need to grasp every opportunity for evaluation.
For this, we need all 27 Member States.
I believe that the 27 Member States must find a common solution and make a common decision regarding the next step.
As Commissioner Barroso said, '27 Member States signed the Treaty; we must make every effort to make sure that 27 Member States find a way forward'.
We must find a solution, a way to break the deadlock.
in writing. - (RO) The European process needs to continue.
The vote of the Irish citizens for the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty must be respected.
At the same time, we need to take into consideration the larger interests of all the European Union citizens in making the European structure more efficient, as well as in continuing the process of the Union enlargement.
The Irish citizens don't have only rights, but they also have obligations in the EU.
They need to be aware of the consequences they undertake by rejecting the Lisbon Treaty.
The Irish citizens will have to decide by a new referendum whether they leave the European Union or they stay in the EU based on the Lisbon Treaty.
The stoppage of the European process by invoking the "intact sovereignty” of the Irish actually means the stoppage of the natural aspirations of the citizens from Croatia, the Republic of Moldova etc. to approach the EU.
Just like Ireland and the Irish political representatives have the right to fight for the aspirations of their citizens, Romania is entitled to fight for the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union.
in writing. - (PT) Following the victorious NO vote in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, the leaders of the European Union should have recognised what was obvious: that the Lisbon Treaty has failed.
They know that it only takes one Member State not to ratify a treaty for this to be prevented from entering into force.
Those are the rules.
It should also be noted that this rejection follows on from two other identical results in France and the Netherlands on the so-called European Constitution, which was the forerunner of the Lisbon Treaty.
However, the only recognition made by the President of the European Commission has been that it will take time and effort to solve the problem created by the Irish referendum.
He is trying to lay the blame at Ireland's door and is failing to recognise that the problem stems from the deep crisis of legitimacy of the neoliberal, militarist and federalist policies which are being pursued.
The European Council must therefore this week answer a fundamental question: whether to abandon the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty due to this being dead in the water, or to launch a debate on the real reasons for people's discontent and make the necessary political changes in order to tackle the current crises, in other words promote greater social justice and more security in employment with rights, combat speculative profits and prices, and give priority to the fight for social inclusion.
in writing. - (RO) The recent vote of the Irish was interpreted in various manners in the European Community and the speeches in the Parliament confirm the difficulties that this vote might produce.
I would like to refer briefly to the problems that the vote of the Irish citizens might cause in the public opinion of the countries recently integrated into the EU, especially the Eastern European countries.
The citizens of these countries will have great difficulties in understanding the binding nature of taking over those European norms involving economic sacrifices into the national framework, as well as a series of public policies that citizens consider much too restrictive for the economic stage in which these countries are now.
What I would like to emphasize here is that any attempt to introduce exceptional treatments in the Community framework will be certainly reflected in the 2009 political vote, which might provide reasons for the radicalization of an electorate that voted very enthusiastically in favour of these countries' accession to the EU.
in writing. - (HU) There are many ways of interpreting the Irish referendum.
It is a victory for popular sovereignty: we cannot deny this simple fact.
At the same time, however, a majority of the voters did not know what they were voting for, as was indicated by the fact that supporters of the 'no' campaign referred to historical grievances that have actually been resolved by European Union membership.
We may consider it an injustice that 53% of the voters in a relatively small country have the power to obstruct twenty-six other nations from deepening their cooperation and fulfilling the European dream.
One thing is certain, however, and that is that in future we must discuss integration with the citizens of the European Union in a more intelligent, persuasive and readily comprehensible manner.
For this reason, the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education is initiating a report with the working title 'Active dialogue with citizens on Europe'.
I have been asked to prepare this report.
I ask my fellow Members to support our work by sharing their ideas; let us gather our thoughts, so that not only will we come to understand and to love the issue of integration and cooperation, but we will ensure that Europe's citizens grow to understand and to love it too.
in writing. - (PL) We are today debating the future of the European Union.
We are doing so in the wake of the emotions raised by the outcome of the referendum in Ireland.
I appeal to all concerned, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Commission and of the Council, to refrain from lecturing the people of Ireland and threatening them with a range of reprisals including exclusion from the Union.
The facts are that the Union exists and the vote by the Irish nation is not a vote against the Union.
In my view, it is an expression of opposition to the document entitled the Lisbon Reform Treaty.
The Irish people rejected the particular version of reform presented to them.
It is highly likely that if the same question had been put to the citizens of other countries in a referendum, they would have given exactly the same answer.
After all, the Treaty is incomprehensible even to an educated citizen of the European Union.
We would do well to consider whether this is not a novel signal indicating that the so-called elite should try to bridge the considerable gap that currently exists between citizens of the Member States and the leaders of political groupings at both national and Union level.
The relevant provisions of international law actually state that if even one of the states parties to the agreement does not accept the international agreement then the agreement is not binding in that form.
That is clear, regardless of our views on the document as a whole.
The people of Ireland chose freely.
We must respect their decision and seek positive solutions for the future of Europe.
As the saying goes, vox populi, vox dei.
in writing. - (FI) Crisis!
Crisis!
Again people are shouting about the EU being in crisis, because the Irish rejected the Treaty of Lisbon in their referendum on Thursday 12 June.
The Treaty can only enter into force if it is ratified by all the Member States.
The EU leaders are calling for new solutions, but few have any to offer.
There are at least two problems.
The Treaty of Lisbon is so obscure that it is almost impossible to understand.
Would you be ready to sign it?
What is more, the EU elite obviously want to move forward too fast.
Now it is time for the small Member States to act.
They should insist on every Member State having its own Commissioner.
That originally was the wish of Finland and many other countries.
The Treaty of Lisbon, if it took effect, would lead to a situation where each Member States would be without a Commissioner for a third of the time in turn as from 2014.
The wording of the Treaty is so vague that in practice the small Member States would apparently be without a Commissioner for longer than the big ones.
Ireland is thought by some to have rejected the Treaty partly on account of the Commissioner issue.
Finland's Commissioner is of special importance for small Member States, even though it is the duty of Commissioners to promote the interests of the EU as a whole.
In Finland every region rejoices if it has its 'own' minister in the Cabinet.
EU leaders now need to think carefully about what is the source of the public's growing distrust of the EU.
Has the Union acted in the interests of all its citizens in the best possible way?
Has it increased cooperation in different areas and expanded too fast?
in writing. - (PL) The decision by the people of Ireland has put Europe in a difficult situation.
It also proves that Europe is based on active democracy.
The fate of the Lisbon Treaty is not a foregone conclusion.
Similar situations have arisen in the past.
In 1993, after a negative outcome regarding ratification of the Treaty on European Union, Denmark decided to hold a further referendum.
Similarly, it was decided to hold a second referendum in Ireland after the disaster concerning ratification of the Treaty of Nice in 2001.
I firmly believe that on this occasion too, we should respect the outcome of the Irish referendum as being Ireland's sovereign decision.
The Union is based on respect for the right of all Member States to express their own will.
It should be clearly stated that rejection of the Treaty does not mean that the Irish people are opposed to the Union.
The forthcoming European Council is an opportunity to reflect on the causes and effects of the situation that has arisen.
Such reflection should not be limited to lecturing and censuring Ireland.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament must consider what can be done to enable Europeans to better understand the Treaty and the intentions of the elite.
I am opposed to reopening negotiations on Treaty reform.
Europe must not become a two or more speed Europe.
It must prove to its own citizens that it is a common project imbued with solidarity.
I am confident that the Council will find a solution acceptable to those countries that have already ratified the Treaty, to Ireland, and also to Member States that are undecided as to how to proceed.
in writing. - (PL) The outcome of the Irish referendum upset the process of ratification of the Reform Treaty.
The referendum also served to emphasise just how much concern we should devote to our great European project to create a Europe characterised by peace and solidarity, whose main preoccupation is the good of its citizens and playing a strong role on the global economic and political stage.
We now have proof of the heavy price to be paid if we neglect to engage in dialogue with our societies to explain what integration is all about.
The process of ratification should continue, and I am confident that Ireland will make every effort to resolve the situation.
I agree with the view expressed by Mr Schulz, the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that the way in which the European Commission and the European Council operate is one of the underlying reasons for the current state of affairs.
Increasing the competences of the European Parliament as a democratic institution could make a greater contribution to streamlining the Union than major declarations and programmes, as the latter fail to reach the citizens' hearts and minds.
in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Dublin's 'no' to the Lisbon Treaty was a surprise because it was with EU support that Ireland has built up a competitive economy, stabilised the labour market and created a welfare society.
It would have been possible for the Irish to vote for a stronger, more competitive European Union, one that served the Member States' interests more than before.
Personally I take the view that putting the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum appeared to be democratic, but deceptively so.
Internal problems, in which the EU does not intervene, inevitably created tensions which needed to be vented.
Therefore it is easy to create an apparent opportunity to express one's dissatisfaction without regard to the means.
Also indicative of the sham democracy and the tensions being expressed were the opinion polls conducted before the referendum, from which it emerged that the people who voted 'no' did not know the actual content, or much about the significance, of the Lisbon Treaty.
It is up to Irish politicians to answer the question 'why?'
Ireland has consistently been one of the most successful users of EU subsidies.
The Irish are known for their pro-European attitude.
All the more ironic, then, that because of Ireland we will have to put a stop to the creation of a stronger common future.
Estonia ratified the Lisbon Treaty a day before the Irish referendum.
This means that, unlike Dublin, Tallinn has helped to build a common future.
I am a firm supporter of the ratification process, and I believe that Ireland will make a new attempt to assure the 500 million citizens of Europe and they too bear the name of Europeans with honour.
Dublin's debt of gratitude to Europe is obvious.
in writing. - Mr President, although the result of the Irish referendum was a great disappointment to the European Union, it is not the proper time to panic and look for a scapegoat.
The European Council is about to hold its meeting on June 19 and 20 in Brussels.
We should first take time to hear the explanations of Taoiseach Brian Cowen and listen to his proposals on how to go on with Ireland.
In my opinion the remaining eight Member States must go on with the ratification as scheduled, despite the Irish "no".
The Treaty of Lisbon is indispensable for the successful continuation of the European project.
It would be unthinkable to restart new negotiations, as the European Union has occupied itself with negotiations on its future for the past nine years.
The Treaty of Lisbon creates a more understandable, democratic and efficient European Union and we cannot quit on that just yet.
in writing. - (FI) Democracy literally means the power of the people.
There cannot be democracy without the people and it is not good for the people to be without democracy.
In Ireland the people were able to vote on the new constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon.
That was democracy, and the Irish voted no on behalf of all the other nations.
It accounted for 53.4% of the votes, with 46.6% voting yes.
In Ireland they did not want the EU moving in the direction of a federation, or becoming militarised, or a further shift of power towards the big countries.
The federation idea is promoted by men and women who are poor democrats and poor losers.
They have begun to revive the body by force.
They say that the small countries are not needed if they will not comply with the very real authority of the big ones.
This way they perpetrate the misconception of EU democracy.
The Irish are denounced for the way they exercised their powers but no one is laughing at the Hungarians, although the parliament there voted yes even before the unreadable treaty had been submitted to it.
The decision of the Irish people is democracy, but that of the Hungarian Parliament is not.
The desire to have a constitution for the EU does not come from the needs of the people but from the will to shore up the power of the elite.
Without referendums it will be a coup - in both the small and the big countries.
in writing. - While we keep behind our closed doors states like Croatia, Turkey, Ukraine and Moldova, which are struggling to become members, we strive to keep in states which are unsure that it is worthwhile to be members of a strong union.
It is unfair, unproductive and unsustainable to treat the eurosceptics better than the euro-enthusiasts.
Equal respect for all nations means confronting each one with its own responsibility.
Trying to cheat and tempt someone with illusory protocols and concessions in order to change decisions without changing convictions would be an offence and a lack of democratic respect.
The Irish people should take as much time as necessary in order to reflect on its European future.
Perhaps the best frame for such a democratic reflection would be early elections.
Anyhow, the Irish must use their own time and not the others' time.
Therefore an interim status for Ireland within the EU, letting the European integration progress with fewer states involved, must be considered.
Eventually, through a new referendum, the Irish people should answer the question of whether they want to stay in the European Union on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty or if they want to play a 'chevalier role' in the storms of the global order.
in writing. - (PL) The rejection of the Lisbon Treaty by the people of Ireland has stifled any hope of swift institutional reform of the European Union.
It is the second such wasted opportunity.
The work was halted in the past by the negative outcome of the earlier French and Dutch referenda.
In my view, the people of Ireland are certainly not to blame for what has happened.
The fact that they voted against the Treaty does not mean that they are negatively disposed towards the European Union as a whole.
The Treaty was rejected in Ireland because of the inappropriate way that the European institutions and the governments of the Member States handled the question of Treaty ratification and the citizens' involvement in the process.
I suspect that if a referendum had been carried out in all the Member States, Ireland would not have been the only one to say 'no'.
Such a reaction to the Treaty by the citizens is due to disinformation rather than to ill-will.
The action the Union should now take regarding the fate of the Lisbon Treaty should be similar to that taken after the Constitutional Treaty was rejected by the Netherlands and France.
Fortunately, the Union is still able to function effectively on the basis of the Treaty of Nice and of the other treaties still in force.
This means that we can take time to consider carefully how to correct the mistakes made.
in writing. - (PL) In view of the decision by the people of Ireland, as expressed in the latest referendum, it is even more important for Poland to finalise ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
If the President of Poland brings the process to a standstill on the basis of the argument concerning final signature, he will thereby align our country with those who are against the Treaty, in opposition to the overwhelming majority of countries who have accepted it.
That would not be to our advantage.
We have in the past resorted to threats, some would even say to blackmail, but we did agree to a compromise.
We must abide by the consequences of the latter, especially following the outcome of the Irish referendum.
Poland actually has the opportunity to play its part in a key action aimed at creating a strong Europe.
Swift ratification of the Treaty will not be a routine step, but a significant political gesture.
I believe it can be taken for granted that sooner or later, with Ireland or without it, the substance of the Treaty will be implemented.
It is therefore important for us to be on the right side at the right time.
in writing. - (RO) The European Parliament and the other European institutions must respect the vote made by the Irish people at the referendum.
I am telling it very clearly: the Irish citizens did not vote against the European Union, but against the Lisbon Treaty.
We have clear signals that the content and grounds of this Treaty have not been understood, and the fears of the Irish people regarding the taxation system and the preservation of neutrality have been increased by certain political parties.
The European Parliament has to send a clear signal of support for the ratification process in the other Member States.
At the same time, we have to present viable solutions to the Irish citizens and the Irish government for overcoming this impasse.
In the end, the Lisbon Treaty is the necessary step forward for the European institutions system to operate more efficiently, under the ever more difficult global conditions to which every Member State has to respond: economic competitiveness, climate change, price increases for natural resources and many other aspects that affect us all.
in writing. - (CS) The Lisbon Treaty has become a dead document, just as when the French and the Dutch rejected the EU draft Constitution.
Although the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, declared that the aim of the Treaty was to achieve greater democracy, greater political effectiveness and greater clarity and transparency, and that the ratification process must continue in those Member States that have not yet ratified it, these are just meaningless phrases.
Had referenda taken place in countries other than Ireland, the Irish 'no' would surely not have been the only one.
Take the trickery employed by the 'European elite' who presented nothing more than the dusted and amended EU draft Constitution for ratification!
In addition to the Irish, the French and the Dutch would say 'no' again; after all, public opinion surveys carried out in these countries indicate as much.
Those who 'steer' EU policy should realise, at long last, that the majority of citizens reject the Union as a militarist and neo-liberal project that is effectively antisocial!
The result of the Irish referendum is not a disaster for Europe, as some people would have us believe.
It is a chance to start a new discussion process in which, at last, ordinary citizens should also be widely involved.
After all, the Irish did not vote against the European Union. They voted against the contents of the Lisbon Treaty that would ruin the social standards achieved to date, and turn the Union into a militarist conglomerate.
The so-called European idea is not thrown into jeopardy by those who reject the Lisbon Treaty. It is thrown into jeopardy by those who are now shouting 'let us go on' or considering introducing a 'two-speed' Europe.
in writing. - (FR) From tomorrow the European Council will be required to draw the conclusions from the result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
It is up to Ireland, through its Taoiseach, to provide an analysis of this vote and to reiterate its desire to see European integration move forward.
I hope that the EU27 agree to continue with the ratification process in the Member States that have not yet taken a decision so that we will eventually know each country's exact position on this text.
The Slovenian and then the French Presidencies must work with Ireland to try to find a legally acceptable solution that would put an end once and for all to more than 15 years of efforts to reform the workings of the enlarged Europe.
The responsibilities of the French Presidency will surely increase given that the European context is disrupted and the global markets in raw material foodstuffs and fuels are shooting up.
The people of Europe are unsure.
The European Council must show them that Europe is helping to meet their expectations by reaching decisions on the fundamental issues.
Although that may not resolve the institutional question immediately, it is nevertheless the best way of showing the Irish that they have been heard.
in writing. - (HU) The Lisbon Treaty has been rejected by the very country that up to now has set an example of how to make full use of the benefits of European integration.
The deep crisis of confidence in politics also illustrates this.
Poor communication in terms of demonstrating the benefits of the Lisbon Treaty also played a major part in this failure.
Ireland did not decide on the Treaty; the outcome of the referendum was determined by domestic policy issues.
The referendum as an institution has proven to be an unsuitable instrument for deciding complex issues such as this.
The Lisbon Treaty is not just about institutional reform in the European Union; the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights make Europe a genuine political community and a community of values.
This is a new level in the development of European integration in qualitative terms.
The Irish referendum is a major problem, but it depends on us whether the European Union falls back into crisis this time or responds rapidly and decisively.
In the present situation the biggest mistake would be to renegotiate the deal that took so much effort to achieve, and therefore we should keep the Lisbon Treaty as it stands.
Nearly two thirds of the Member States have adopted the Treaty, including Hungary, the first country to do so.
The ratification process must continue.
Ireland must decide as soon as possible, whether it wants to continue to be a part of deepening integration; one country cannot stand in the way of another 26 that want to move forward.
I have every confidence that the European Council meeting that begins tomorrow will find a way out of this situation.
The work of building Europe must continue, and to do that we need the Lisbon Treaty.
in writing. - (RO) The European Union needs a new institutional framework after the Treaty of Nice, and the Lisbon Treaty, although less ambitious than the European Constitution, is a good text.
18 Member States have ratified the Lisbon Treaty in their national parliaments.
Ireland decided the ratification by referendum, and the Irish citizens rejected the Treaty.
In 2001, Ireland voted against the Treaty of Nice as well and, one year later, it ratified it.
The vote of the Irish people shows that this country's population considers the Community institutional construction a complicated one.
It is our duty to explain to the European citizens the need for and the provisions of this treaty.
This Treaty deals with the issue of climate change, defines the European economy as a social market economy, emphasizes the need for a common energy policy and, in particular, gives legal value to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Reform Treaty enhances the level of democracy by increasing the power of the European Parliament and allows half of the national parliaments to reject a legislative project if it is deemed that it infringes the principle of subsidiary.
The vote of the Irish people shows us that we need responsibility and more dialogue, that we need to explain more and better the provisions of this new treaty to the European citizens, as well as the reasons why it is necessary.
in writing. - (PL) The European nations that long for freedom and sovereignty now have reason to thank the Irish nation.
A message of freedom and hope has gone out, loud and clear, from little Ireland.
That message should be a wake-up call for the enemies of democracy who disregard the will of the people and break the previously agreed rules of the game.
The question of what to do next has arisen.
I submit that instead of dreaming about an unattainable European superstate, we should launch a debate on the rights of the nations.
We should first agree on a charter concerning the rights of the nations, and use that as a basis for defining the principles of European integration.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are the architects of the European Union.
I urge you to stop the manipulation, and to allow the people themselves to determine their future by putting them in possession of the truth.
I call on you to allow the nations to live in their sovereign states, which will decide for themselves how and with whom to cooperate and how and with whom to integrate.
The Irish people's resounding 'no' vote has made the Lisbon Treaty unenforceable.
This represents a significant defeat for the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament, and also for the centre-right and centre-left governments in the EU Member States (New Democracy (ND) and PASOK in Greece).
It is a setback for the representatives of capitalism in general, who played a leading role in quashing the vote of the peoples of the Netherlands and France against the EU Constitution, and in suppressing the growing movement within the EU to challenge and reject the Treaty of Lisbon.
These same political forces are those constituting the great alliance in the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament: the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and other supporters of the European 'monolith', with the participation of the New Democracy and PASOK MEPs.
In Parliament's plenary sitting on 20 February 2008 they all voted against the proposal to respect the verdict of the Irish people and against holding referendums on the Lisbon Treaty in the Member States.
The heavy-handed policy of the Council and the European Commission in pursuing the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty is an autocratic act of contempt for the will of the Irish people and the peoples generally.
Composition of political groups : see Minutes
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
(EL) Mr President, competition policy is exclusively the responsibility of the European Commission.
One may well wonder, then, why the Commission does not exercise this exclusive responsibility, when the price of oil has risen by 50% since the beginning of the year.
There is all the more reason for concern when the Commission is failing to exercise this responsibility on two fronts: externally, where an oil cartel is obviously playing a part in setting prices that are such a burden to the more vulnerable sections of the European population, and also internally, where another oil cartel is likewise maintaining excessively high prices, since the oil companies' profits remain over-inflated.
I therefore call on the Commissioner for Competition to exercise her responsibilities in those specific areas where citizens expect it of her: in matters that affect their everyday lives.
(Applause)
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Allergies are the epidemic of today, and have typically spread throughout Europe since the Second World War.
Today, one third of children have an allergy and, if we do not do something about it, in time half the European population will suffer from this illness.
Foods containing chemicals and the polluted environment are to blame for allergies.
Allergic symptoms can, however, be triggered by natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollens and other natural substances.
In Hungary ragweed is the biggest problem.
Unfortunately, the European Union does not currently have an allergy strategy, as the Commission has confirmed at my request.
Civil society organisations for allergic illnesses and many millions of European citizens who are affected expect us to act against allergies at European level too, and for us to do something towards prevention, stopping the triggers and ensuring that such illnesses are symptom-free.
Action against allergies would also prove that the European Union cares about the health and everyday concerns of its citizens.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, last week the EU-Russia Summit was held in Khanty-Mansiysk and gave an impulse to start talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement.
Apart from this important development, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and President Dmitri Medvedev held the first official meeting of Heads of State of the two countries in over 14 years.
The Border Treaty between the Republic of Estonia and the Russian Federation was among several issues discussed.
President Ilves stated that the preamble that the Estonian Parliament decided to add to the document, which the State Duma subsequently did not ratify, was unnecessary.
Commissioner Siim Kallas reminded us that the additional preamble referring to the Tartu Peace Treaty was simply a domestic political provocation during the actual events.
I see no reason why this preamble should not be removed from the Border Treaty as the Tartu Peace Treaty is still a valid international treaty and the new Border Treaty only acknowledges the control line between Estonia and Russia, their border, and the external border of the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, last week the German Freie Demokratische Partei MEP Mrs Koch-Mehrin suggested that if Poland decided not to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, it should be excluded from the Union.
This scandalous utterance was a comment on the statement made by the Polish President relating to not signing the Treaty after the Irish referendum fiasco, as this would be irrelevant.
Under EU law, unanimity in this regard is essential.
This preposterous utterance by a fellow Member is part of a dishonourable tradition in this House of disregard for the will of European peoples, which constitutes a major threat to the foundations of democracy.
Lack of respect for the result of the Irish referendum, along with the call for Poland to be excluded from the EU, are proof of this.
Countries that base themselves on Community law are to be punished simply for observing that law.
This is the true face of today's EU.
It is but one step away from totalitarianism.
I want to call on all my fellow Members to have more respect for those who have elected us.
It is we who are supposed to be putting their will into action, not the other way around.
We must not forget this!
Mr Rogalski, we were delighted to hear that your president has declared that Poland will ratify the Treaty of Lisbon.
Indeed, that is what the parliaments agreed to do.
(HU) Mr President, in May this year the leaders of the Romanian community in Ukraine sent an open letter to the President of Romania, and raised their voices in a separate statement against the Ukrainian education policy, which is discriminatory and aims to abolish teaching in Romanian completely and to assimilate the Romanian community by force.
Hungarians living in Ukrainian Subcarpathia are afflicted by the same anti-minority policy.
Decree No 461/2008 of the Ministry of Education stipulates that the school education of national minorities be switched over to the official language of Ukraine and that education be completely Ukrainianised.
The European Parliament and the Member States of the Union, including Romania and Hungary, condemn Ukraine's systematic attempts to assimilate national minorities, and call upon it to comply in full with the international obligations it has assumed in the area of human and minority rights and the provisions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which it has also signed.
Thank you.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the workers of the Fapobol company, against whom disciplinary proceedings have been launched with the intention of dismissing them for having demanded payment of their outstanding wages.
Following disciplinary proceedings, the Fapobol management has unacceptably sent out dismissal notices to workers, some of whom have worked at the company for more than 35 years.
The entire company structure is affected, including management and trade union representatives who had taken part in a demonstration calling for the payment of outstanding wages.
Expressing our solidarity with all the workers and trade unionists who have fallen foul of this repressive action, as well as with the Union of Workers in the Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Petrol and Gas Industries in Northern Portugal, we believe that this company's stance deserves to be condemned here in the strongest terms possible, as it seeks to intimidate workers and trade unionists through an attitude akin to a witch hunt that flies in the face of democracy and freedom.
(BG) Respected colleagues, I would like to acquaint you with a case of violation of the rights of two Bulgarian children and their parents in the Netherlands.
In June 2006 the social bureau took away the children of Bulgarian citizen Roumyana Ivanova, residing in the Netherlands.
The children are aged four and fourteen.
The only meeting with them that was permitted was terminated because the mother spoke in Bulgarian.
After this date, the parents haven't seen their children for a year, in spite of the numerous appeals.
Contrary to the law, the children are separated from one another.
The girl is at a juvenile detention facility for problem children and the authorities do not give information about the whereabouts of the boy.
Even the ambassador is refused a meeting and is not given information.
The Bulgarian State Agency for Child Protection and other organizations are continuing to send requests for the children to be accepted for raising in Bulgaria pursuant to Article 5, 9 and 20 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in respect to contact with the parents, fostering and care for them in their homeland.
The Dutch authorities have not expressed a position to date.
I am convinced that the Bulgarian public, the European public, should not remain uninvolved in the violation of international conventions and should not allow a second Libya case, only this time in the heart of Europe.
I ask you, respected colleagues, to please express your categorical opinion on the matter before the Dutch authorities.
(BG) Mr. President, colleagues, the bridge is a symbol of unification, it is carried by every banknote from EUR 50 to 5.
There is, however, a bridge in Europe which, although it is called Bridge of Friendship, still divides people.
It is the only bridge between Bulgaria and Romania along the 350 km river border on the Danube.
To cross it both ways costs nearly EUR 17.
The fee is illegitimate and hinders both business and the free movement of people.
It does not reflect the real costs for maintenance of the bridge.
In 2007, EUR 12 million were collected on the Bulgarian side while only EUR 17,000 were invested in the maintenance of the bridge.
I am convinced that if the European Court is notified it will rule against this fee.
But why should the citizens of Rousse and Giurgiu wait for that?
I appeal to the Bulgarian and the Romanian authorities to respond to the expectations of the citizens by waiving the fee for crossing the bridge between Rousse and Giurgiu.
I am also turning to the Commission to encourage the finding of a solution to this pressing public problem.
(ET) My fellow Member Toomas Savi has already mentioned Khanty-Mansiysk, a small town in Siberia where the European Union-Russia summit was held at the end of last month; it was also the venue for another very important event, namely the Fifth Finno-Ugric World Congress in which the Presidents of four countries participated - Russia, Hungary, Finland and Estonia.
A five-member European Parliament delegation also attended the Congress and our main objective was to focus attention on the small Finno-Ugric peoples, 19 of which live in the Russian Federation, and to draw attention to the fact that their languages and cultures run the risk of destruction.
Hopefully the agreement for which the foundations were laid at the EU-Russia summit in Khanty-Mansiysk will also draw attention to the human rights situation, which is, in fact, deplorable.
(SK) I welcome the fact that the theme of the June EU Council of Health Ministers was an initiative entitled 'European Antibiotic Awareness Day'.
The aim is to raise citizens' awareness that antibiotics need to be used responsibly and only in indicated cases.
Incorrect usage is becoming a serious threat to public health.
Bacteria are becoming more and more resistant, with the result that antibiotics will be of very limited use in the future.
The campaign is being run by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Union institutions and the World Health Organization.
It should be supplemented by national strategies.
A workshop on anti-microbiological resistance is to be held in Paris and the Czech Presidency is preparing a conference on this subject.
A logo has also been produced for the campaign.
(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, I welcome the initiative of the European Commission, which adopted the directive on cross-border healthcare services last week.
This proposal has the advantage of creating a clear legislative framework, which establishes the rules according to which the European citizens can resort to healthcare services in the European Union area, in another Member State than the one where they contribute to the health system, as well as the way of reimbursing expenses to the patients.
The proposal, which should have been submitted for adoption to the European Parliament and the Council a long time ago, is a long-waited and opportune proposal, especially in the context in which healthcare was excluded from the directive on liberalization of commercial services.
Until now, European citizens had to refer to the European Court of Justice, which acknowledged the citizens' right to medical treatment in all cases and obliged Member States to reimburse their expenses.
I strongly believe that this initiative will have a positive effect on improving the health condition of the European citizens who, for various reasons, cannot request such services in their country of origin, as well as on increasing the quality of medical procedures in the European area.
(PL) Mr President, we Polish MEPs have become very disturbed by the situation in Belarus, a country that borders the European Union.
Recently that country's parliament passed a very restrictive act on freedom of speech, which may result in even further constriction of the already narrow margin of freedom of speech in Belarus.
Its entry into force depends only on the signature of the dictator, Mr Lukashenko, and that is no more than a formality.
The highly repressive nature of this act will above all impact on independent journalists and publishers.
This is quite clearly a gag on the free media in Belarus, on independent public opinion and on a nascent civil society.
In view of this situation, the European Parliament must provide a reminder of the basic standards that apply in our continent, of which the Republic of Belarus is a part.
The award by our Parliament of the Sakharov Prize to the Belarusian Association of Journalists three years ago is all the more reason why we should take this step.
(DE) Mr President, the location for the EU-Russia Summit was not chosen at random.
Khanty-Mansiysk is the centre of Russian oil extraction.
In the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, Russia puts the focus on the economy.
From the point of view of the EU, there should be a closer focus on human rights.
Under Dmitry Medvedev, Alexander Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky are still in prison.
For the last week, both have been under the threat of new charges with a potential prison term of up to 20 years.
The Russian authorities are playing for time until Mr Medvedev takes a clear position.
Progress and binding commitments by Moscow are needed urgently on this matter, including in terms of solving political murders and clarifying the situation regarding restrictions on freedom of the press and of opinion.
In the future, the EU must present a united front and speak with one voice to Moscow so as to build up the political pressure.
This is about nothing less than the credibility of the EU.
(BG) Mr. President, in recent weeks the press has begun to feature comments about the attitude of the European Commission to the various member-states as an example of double standard.
Obviously, every subsequent expansion will encounter an increasingly strict application of the criteria.
Bulgaria and Romania, for example, are subjected to an unprecedented mechanism of cooperation and verification in the field of justice and home affairs.
There is no doubt there are serious problems and the two countries have to maintain a high rate of reform.
But is the approach of the European Commission identical to all?
There are countries where organized crime has penetrated deeply and the consequences are visible: misuse of European funds, backwardness and street crime, xenophobia.
I have not, however, encountered an official comment or motion for respective measures from the Commission.
When speaking of corruption in the corridors of power, I can imagine what the reaction of the Commission would be if a Bulgarian prime minister introduces a law that would save him from prosecution.
Such actions, however, are passed over with silence when it comes to the country of the former Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.
I could quote a number of other examples.
I would like to be clear - I am not asking for compromises for Bulgaria or Romania, I am asking for fair and equal treatment of each member-state.
(SK) In March 2003, when Castro's regime unjustly convicted and imprisoned 75 Cuban dissidents, the European Union introduced sanctions against Cuba.
More than 50 political prisoners, whose families we have long been supporting through a form of 'adoption', are also being held under inhumane conditions in Cuban prisons.
We are concerned about their poor state of health.
Before removing the EU sanctions on Cuba, have those involved asked the 2005 Andrei Sakharov laureates, the 'Ladies in White', whether the situation in the sphere of human rights and civil liberties in Cuba has changed since the accession of Raul Castro?
Mr President, thank you for your personal involvement in the issue of the release of political prisoners in Cuba and may I ask you once again to urge the Cuban President, on behalf of the European Parliament, to immediately release all Cuban dissidents.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, one of the key common values of the European Union is its linguistic and cultural diversity.
A whole raft of states have adopted the Minority Languages Charter alongside their own legislation in support of this diversity.
Such states include the Federal Republic of Germany.
I should like to point out that the obligations thereby accepted require financial support for minority cultural institutions.
In the case of Załožby za serbski lud (Foundation for the Sorbian People), resources have been gradually cut back over the years.
This is not a good example of meeting obligations under the Charter.
We call upon the German Government to keep its promises.
Let us not allow yet another nation to disappear from the map of Europe.
Mr President, last month a young Palestinian journalist from Gaza, Mohammed Omer, a man in favour of reconciliation and peace with the Israelis, was able, with the assistance of the Dutch Government, to travel to the European Union to be presented with an award for his journalism.
On his return, he was detained, humiliated, beaten and tortured by the Israeli secret service.
The Dutch Government has expressed its shock, I am told, but this behaviour by Israel is part of a pattern.
Why are we considering closer relations with Israel when agents of that government perform such acts of violence against the very people whose advocacy of peace and reconciliation will command the support of the vast majority of Members here?
Why are we supporting such moves when we know that that government will do absolutely nothing to criticise or condemn their behaviour?
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of people within the Schengen Area is undoubtedly a positive European value.
It means, however, free movement for many and varied enemies of society.
Thanks to information systems and the efforts of Europol and Interpol, the hunt for criminals and escapees operates reasonably well, but we are repeatedly encountering problems in enforcing remedial measures imposed as punishment by the courts.
I am thinking of measures like bans on pursuing certain occupations, compulsory psychiatric or sexological treatment and the whole area of supervision of people released from prison on parole.
There is undoubtedly a need to speed up work on a European information system and above all to ensure that national institutions are obliged not only to contribute to such a system, but also to draw the appropriate data from it.
(RO) Prior to Romania's accession to the European Union, there were many voices in this Parliament claiming that the Roma people are discriminated against in Romania.
For this reason, several NGOs have published various studies in this field.
Romania has continually stated that the Roma people are a major concern for the authorities, but one cannot say that there is discrimination.
Romania has implemented programmes for the integration of Roma in the society, including measures mainly related to education and even positive discrimination actions.
After 2007, the Roma people, not only from Romania, but also from Eastern countries, spread to Europe for economic reasons, but especially for reasons related to the nomadic tradition of these people.
This was an opportunity for those who gave advice to implement it.
Unfortunately, what has happened in Italy is not a European lesson.
It is inadmissible to fingerprint European citizens and, especially, children, it is not normal to set fire to camps installed, with the tacit consent of the authorities.
I believe the situation of the Roma people are European Community subjects and I ask all those with responsibilities - European institutions, governments, NGOs - to contribute to drawing up a common, coherent policy for the integration of these people, but entirely based on European principles.
Mr President, I want to demonstrate our solidarity with Fujitsu workers in Birmingham who are threatened with redundancy.
There are plans to relocate part of the Fujitsu activities to the US, and this may mean up to 140 people losing their jobs.
The union involved in this case is the Communication Workers Union, and it has been admirably flexible in its dealings with Fujitsu management.
The single-shift system they proposed to Fujitsu would have saved 60 jobs, yet in the final board decision on 30 June, with no prior indication from the board that a decision would be reached so quickly, alternative proposals were rejected out of hand.
I would ask Fujitsu to reconsider the relocation, or at the very least to ensure that the only jobs lost are on a voluntary basis and that those who want to continue to work should be able to do so.
EU legislation clearly states that a company must conduct a consultation procedure with its employees, yet again and again employers are doing too little, too late to abide by this legislation.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask an administrative question concerning Parliament.
For over two years, the post of head of the European Parliament Office in Luxembourg has been vacant.
The post has been advertised once, six months ago.
Candidates were selected but no decision was made after I put questions to the administration. Your office, Mr President, has not been able to give me an answer either.
I would like to know whether there are specific reasons why this post has not been filled and why the chosen candidates have not been appointed.
(RO) The Commission's Work Programme for 2008 includes, among strategic initiatives, the adoption of a package regarding the development of ecological transport.
This autumn, the Commission shall present a legislative proposal for revision of the Eurovignette Directive 2006/38.
The objective of this revision is to ensure more efficient use of the transport infrastructure, as well as the reduction of negative effects of transports on the environment, based on the principle of "polluter pays”.
In the context of ever more expensive fuels, the importance of this directive is increasing.
The sustainable economic development of the Union also depends on the development of a more ecological and efficient transport from the energy point of view.
I request the European Commission that the internalization of external costs, generated by transport, take place in a larger context, namely to also review the low VAT rates applicable in the Union, as well as Directive 14 of 2001 on taxation and levying of charges for access to railway infrastructures and Directive 96/2003 on energy taxation.
(NL) Mr President, 10 days ago we launched our campaign against child sex tourism at www.sayno.eu.
Every year, thousands of men from Europe, the United States, Australia and Korea travel to poor countries in South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America to take part in this sickening form of tourism, and this almost always goes unpunished.
The message we want to convey with this citizens' initiative is that this is no longer acceptable.
The European Union, too, can no longer turn a bind eye to this, and we must strengthen the role of Europol, for example.
I am delighted to be able to tell you that, in this very short time, we have already collected 14 000 signatures.
The campaign is of course continuing.
I should also like to express my thanks for the broad support it has received, including from Members of this Parliament.
Not only members of my own group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, have signed; I have also seen the names of fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and others on the list - which is of course most welcome.
I should like to take advantage of the presence of the French Presidency here to thank the French Government for the initiatives it has taken in this regard in the past, often in the face of opposition from other Member States.
I hope, however, that you are not discouraged by this and will develop further initiatives in these six months, too.
(PL) Mr President, several months ago we held a debate in this Chamber on the situation at Gdańsk Shipyard.
Representatives of all the groups drew attention to the need for effective competition between European shipyards and other shipyards in the world market, especially the Korean shipbuilding industry.
They emphasised that closure of two of the three slipways at Gdańsk Shipyard would rule it out of this competition and take away its chance of survival.
We meet in Strasbourg, a city that symbolises European integration.
Maintaining this symbol as the headquarters of the European Parliament costs hundreds of millions of euros each year, but we have respect for this symbol.
Gdańsk Shipyard is a symbol of the fall of communism and integration between Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe.
It would be worthwhile allowing this symbol to remain a living economic entity, a place of work for thousands of employees.
This was the appeal that shipyard workers who demonstrated recently in Brussels were making to the European Commission.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the events currently unfolding in Tunisia, in the Gafsa mining basin.
For several weeks, rallies have been organised against the poverty in this basin, which is rich because it contains many phosphates.
It has to be said that the local population is not profiting from the profits, and we are now seeing extremely serious police and military repression, with harassment, imprisonments, arrests, and the sealing off of towns, particularly Redeyef.
I am asking the EU head of mission - through you, because I believe the European Parliament's intervention is necessary - for this matter to be raised for discussion with the Tunisian authorities, for the Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders to be followed, since trade unionists are being imprisoned and we have several accounts of torture, and for the heads of mission to attend trials, meet families and ask for an explanation from the Tunisian authorities of the repression taking place there.
(RO) The freedom of expression is a basic principle in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Every country must guarantee the freedom of expression, including for ensuring the conditions for independent media.
Unfortunately, in the Republic of Moldova, the Union of Journalists complains about anti-media actions committed during 2001 - 2008 by the Chisinau Government.
The actions invoked by the journalists and that the government uses in the attempt to politically control the public media are: information censorship, criminal investigation of journalists for dispersing opinions contrary to the state policy, forms of calumny, promotion of unfair competition in the press, maximum restriction of the space for debate in the public audio-visual media - which, in the end, affects the final political pluralism and, implicitly, the democracy.
Taking into consideration these actions, I consider that the European Union should monitor compliance with the freedom of expression in this country more carefully.
(HU) I would like to interpret the words of András Léderer, president of the Hungarian liberal party New Generation.
On Saturday the Hungarian March for Dignity started in Budapest.
As in previous years, this year attention was drawn to reducing prejudice against homosexuals, even if only for one day.
Following the attacks with Molotov cocktails in recent weeks, several hundred citizens who sympathise with homosexuals participated in the procession.
The procession was accompanied by unprecedented violence.
Many civilians, police officers and demonstrators were injured, including the administrative director of the Hungarian liberal party, Gábor Horn, and a Socialist Member of the European Parliament, Katalin Lévai.
Since the formation of the Hungarian Guard, several extreme right-wing, neo-Nazi portals have continuously organised aggressive attacks, whether against a Jewish ticket office or against Roma settlements, and now against homosexuals, while the government is visibly impotent and the criminal investigation authorities are incapable of producing results.
Thank you very much.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention and that of the French Presidency to the matter of the European Schools, which, while serving as benchmarks and models for European education, do not take any account of students' learning difficulties (dyslexia, stammering), so that many children are held back in their school progress and subsequent careers as a result of such difficulties.
We have seen failures, then, and pupils dropping out of school, causing considerable difficulty for their parents, who are our fellow Members and EU officials; they are forced to move, so that their children can go to ordinary Member-State schools that have the sensitivity to meet the special needs of children with learning difficulties, as the law and human dignity demand, especially in view of the need to protect children.
Parliament will have further occasion to consider the problems faced by these children.
Mr President, what is happening in Zimbabwe is remarkably sad and overwhelmingly atrocious.
Mr Mugabe, a former fighter for freedom from colonial slavery, has now turned into a ruthless dictator and a barbaric suppressor of justice and the human rights of millions of his countrymen.
The international community - the EU included - has exhausted itself with its rhetoric, statements of condemnation and largely ineffective sanctions.
The time has come for re-election.
To this end, I believe that Mr Mugabe should be brought before an international criminal court, charged with crimes against humanity.
I strongly believe that such a measure is fully justified and realistic and will, I am sure, bring about the desired and urgently needed effect, which is to help the people of Zimbabwe get rid of a totalitarian regime that is fast leading the country into self-destruction.
I believe the EU needs to be a protagonist in the move to bring Mugabe to face international justice.
(EL) Mr President, once again, here in the European Parliament, I would like to raise an issue that concerns the fishermen of my country, the fishermen of the Mediterranean and everyone who cares about the environment.
The Greeks, and European fishermen generally, are subject to stringent restrictions - and rightly so - regarding fishing methods and tools, fishing times, etc.
Third countries, however - Turkish fishermen being a typical example - fish as and when they want, using whatever equipment they choose, so that fish stocks are reduced, the seas are degraded, the environment is degraded.
I think we should take initiatives regarding Turkey, so that that country carries out correct fishing practices.
The environment comes first; and of course, when I say Turkey, I mean all third countries that fish using non-standard methods.
(FR) Mr President, I too am pleased to welcome the French Presidency, with the French minister Mr Jouyet among us.
It is true that it is unusual for the Presidency to be here on a Monday, even during these questions.
I will indeed be talking about the deployment of the police, the riot police, in front of Parliament today.
When I arrived earlier, I went through two riot police cordons.
I wondered what could be posing such a threat to Parliament that such an armada of riot police should be deployed.
Twice I had to state my identity; I was asked why I was in the area of the European Parliament.
I was really very surprised, Mr Jouyet, because I do not feel threatened here and, on the contrary, I feel rather oppressed by all these barriers.
I would like to remind you that surrounding the house of the European people with riot police is a strange way to begin the French Presidency and I am keen to point out that we want this house to remain a house of the people, open to citizens.
(SK) Since we shall not meet again until after 21 August, the 40th anniversary of the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops, I feel it my duty to draw attention to those dramatic events.
It was quite clearly shown at that time that the communist regime was a crime against humanity, just like every totalitarian regime.
After August 1968 in my homeland we witnessed another 20 years of various forms of communist violence and terror from this organised machinery of evil.
Our respect should go to those who did not give in and conducted themselves with honour.
Allow me to paraphrase the words of the Slovak priest Anton Srholec, Chairman of the Confederation of Slovak Political Prisoners: 'We must never cease bearing witness that there are hundreds of thousands of honourable people in Slovakia, who made contributions to the preservation of freedom and human rights.
It is thanks to them that we are once again on the side of democracy, freedom and rights'.
(HU) Thank you.
The town of Khanty-Mansiysk in the Siberian province of Yugra is the site of the Russian summit and of Finno-Ugrian peoples, and in two days' time it will be the site of the fifth World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples.
The EU is also providing financial support to the Finno-Ugric peoples for the fight to maintain their identities.
The speeches by the EU delegation present and the four heads of state, especially the Hungarian head of state, have emphasised how important it is that endangered peoples should have not only dance groups and choirs but also education in their mother tongue and self-determination.
This Congress has two messages for the EU.
The first is that the Year of Intercultural Dialogue should not only be a year of dialogue between the cultures of the large peoples.
The second is that we are facing incomprehensible phenomena when the parliament of a European country wants to vote to decide that its country should be monolingual when there are 75 regional languages in that country.
If the EU and Russia consider it important to preserve the cultures and mother tongues of the peoples living in their territory, this should also be the example for the Member States of the EU to follow.
Thank you.
(PL) Madam President, a few weeks before the Olympic Games in Beijing, the only independent information station, New Tang Dynasty Television, ceased to broadcast to China.
Although the situation has now lasted several weeks, we do not know what caused the breakdown cited by the satellite operator, Eutel Communications, nor do we know when the breakdown will be put right.
We do know, though, who stands to gain from this breakdown and who stands to lose.
Millions of existing customers of independent, non-profit television broadcasting in Chinese and English are forced by the Chinese authorities to endure censorship of information from which they could have learned how effectively Chinese forces are dealing with Tibetan terrorists.
They will not hear about the strikes, disturbances and problems that are happening during the organisation of the Games.
We citizens and representatives of the European Union treat China with the respect it indisputably deserves as a great nation that has made an enormous contribution to the whole of mankind's heritage.
It is a pity that in exchange for this respect we are treated extremely negligently by the authorities in Beijing.
Observance of agreements and adherence to the same principles is something we must demand both of ourselves and of our Chinese partners.
(EL) Madam President, according to an article that appeared in The New York Times a few days ago, an agreement is pending between the US Government and the European Commission that will allow European governments, banks and companies based in the European Union to pass information on European citizens to US agencies, such as credit card transactions, details of journeys made, e-mails and visits to websites - all in an attempt to combat terrorism.
Negotiations are under way on the possibility of European citizens being allowed to take legal recourse against the US Government if they believe their personal rights are being infringed as a result of use of their personal data.
I call on the President and the Members of the European Parliament to investigate the matter, and I call on the European Commission to provide clarifications, so that this House is informed of the content and nature of these talks.
The European Parliament has a duty to protect the personal rights and privacy of European citizens if these are infringed.
Madam President, I wish to raise the issue of the increasing oil prices and particularly the oil futures market.
There are many reasons given for the increase in oil markets.
One is demand; the other is supply and the poor investment in infrastructure in oil for many years.
Professionals in the oil industry and market are increasingly raising the issue of the ridiculously low margin requirement for crude oil futures.
It lies between 5% and 7%.
In other words, if you want to buy 10 million euros' worth of futures in oil, all you have to do is put down half a million euros as an investment.
TrimTabs Investment Research, a leading US independent research service, has said that if their margin requirement was raised between 25% and 50%, which is the same as most people who invest in the stock market pay, it would have a significant impact on lowering oil prices.
The low margin requirement in the market means that the market is open to manipulation.
There is absolutely no question about that.
I have no problem with people investing in futures and commodities, but this is a ridiculously low margin.
We must pursue this issue.
The margin must be increased because the global economic effects are absolutely enormous and we must do everything we possibly can to reduce the price of oil globally.
(PL) Madam President, the Polish President has decided not to append his signature to the Act ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon, having recognised the Treaty as defunct in a situation where the Irish have rejected the document in a referendum.
The Polish President thus recalled the fundamental operating principle of the European Union, to wit, that treaties enter into force only after they have been ratified by all EU Member States.
Application of this principle has hitherto been evident, and it was applied following rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French and the Dutch.
When that happened - despite continuation of the ratification process for that Treaty in many countries - it was recognised that the Constitutional Treaty was nevertheless defunct.
Unfortunately, after both the referendum decision in Ireland and the Polish President's decision, voices were heard in the European Union, including those of some prominent politicians, demanding the ratification of this document by Poland, which is a denial of the essence of European democracy.
I would like to protest strongly against these voices and the pressure and particular type of blackmail that they bring to bear.
That concludes the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.

Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (
Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
(LT) Today in the European Parliament we have adopted the resolution on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community at second reading.
We are amending the Regulation that has been in force since 1992, and I would like to point out once again the amendments that are of the greatest importance to our citizens, and primarily to passengers and aircraft crew.
I am talking about the measures under consideration that would enable us to achieve transparency in air fares and to be more active in banning misleading advertising and dishonest competition in the sphere of air transport.
The amendments intended to ensure greater adherence to flight security standards as well as social guarantees for aircraft crew are of great importance.
It looks as if all disagreements between the Commission and the Council have been resolved, so the Regulation should enter into force at the end of the year.
I do hope that the amended Regulation will be implemented appropriately in all EU Member States.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, today, after 16 years, we have finally given the green light to simplification, unification and at the same time tighter restrictions in regard to the granting and revoking of air operating licences. I hope that the regulation will not result in the liquidation of small sports companies.
I voted for the regulation.
I sincerely believe that the regulation will truly make it possible to revoke the operating licences of companies that cheat customers by giving just their tariffs without any taxes, fees or fuel surcharges and therefore not giving the full price of air tickets.
I hope that the supervising agency will also focus on price discrimination due to the place of residence.
I believe that the amended regulation will lead to improved safety in the operation of air services, in particular by unifying the conditions governing the leasing of aircraft with crew in the EU, as well as from third countries.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President. As the Socialist responsible for this topic, I have supported the compromise recommendations brokered by Mr Ouzký.
I regard it as a success for Parliament and also for the Socialist Group that the Council has also accepted the fact that we should restrict the two glycol solvents more, thus protecting the health of our citizens.
The substance called DEGME damages health when absorbed through the skin.
It is well known that it also limits reproductive ability, so it is a major success that we have prohibited its use not only in paints but also in cleaning materials and floor care products.
Originally, the Commission would only have prohibited DEGME in paints, but through collaboration by all the parties we have also achieved its restriction in cleaning materials.
Inhaling the solvent called DEGME is harmful to human health.
According to the report by the European Commission, it would only have been banned in spray paints, but yet again, upon a recommendation from the Socialists, it has also been restricted in aerosol cleaning materials.
Since there was no plenary debate, I wanted to mention the substance of the compromise recommendations.
(MT) It is important that the European Parliament is aware of the situation in my country regarding water and electricity prices and the effect of today's decision, that is, regarding this case.
That is why I am explaining my vote.
Ever since the government raised the price of oil, it has raised the consumer's bill by imposing a surcharge.
This month it announced that this will increase to 96%.
This will cause new poverty, poverty that will be known as energy poverty.
At the same time, the government is not putting forward any short-term or long-term solution.
Policy on alternative energy is non-existent, despite the fact that in my country we have a lot of sun and wind, even with regard to cleaner energy such as gas, to the extent that the Government has still not begun to give it any consideration.
That is why I voted in this way and that is why what we have done today is important, if not historic.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me explain why I voted the way I did on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/55/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.
The key part of the directive undoubtedly concerns the proposal for the separation of ownership, which would expressly prevent vertically integrated companies from holding an interest in both the supply and transmission of gas.
I voted for the amended compromise proposal because I am convinced that the concerns of countries that were against full ownership unbundling must be taken into account.
I agree with the Commission that the European market in natural gas suffers from lack of investment in transmission infrastructure and a low degree of coordination between individual transmission system operators.
In my opinion, however, we have to take into account the structural diversity of the natural gas and electricity markets and therefore make a distinction between them.
The liberalisation of the gas market must be conducted gradually and symmetrically.
It is necessary to focus especially on harmonisation of the degree of openness of the national markets.
(IT) Mr President, I abstained from the final vote and voted against the proposal for the so-called 'third option' as regards the separation of suppliers and networks in the gas market, because we have lost a major opportunity to affirm the principle of free competition in the gas market.
We should have followed what has taken place in the electricity market; in contrast, this third option in practice offers a guarantee to monopolies and former monopolies in Europe; our national markets will therefore continue to lack comparability, thereby making any prospect of a genuine European energy market even more remote.
What is even worse is that this ambiguous third option in practice means that the former monopolies will be further encouraged and helped to enter into agreements along the lines of those with the Russian gas giant, Gazprom.
(DE) Mr President, as everyone in this House knows, we have had an EC Regulation on the coordination of the European social security systems since 2004 but, unfortunately, no implementing regulation.
The decision taken by the European Parliament finally gives us implementing rules too, which means that we have an instrument with which we can encourage mobility in the European Union without loss of social security.
The establishment of liaison bodies also enables us to provide practical assistance to those who work outside their home country, for example by answering questions on where and how they should apply for pensions.
In other words, we in the European Parliament have ensured that people can obtain real help on welfare matters.
(NL) I abstained in the vote on the Bozkurt report, although in principle I have no objection to a limited form of coordination by the EU Member States of their various social security systems, certainly not if that works to the advantage of European citizens living in a Member State other than their own.
However, I would once again warn against harmonisation, or worse still, uniformity in the different social security systems in the various Member States.
As a Fleming I am, in a manner of speaking, a privileged observer of how a unitary system of social security in Belgium for just two population groups, Flemings and Walloons, is totally unworkable and leads to enormous abuses.
For goodness' sake let each Member State organise and finance its own social security itself, otherwise one way or another you end up with an abuse-ridden system which is worse, more expensive and less efficient, and ultimately that creates less, not more solidarity amongst the peoples of Europe.
(DE) Mr President, I also wanted to explain that I voted in favour of this report because it proposes a new regulation in place of the old one, thereby ensuring that our systems of social security can now be more effectively coordinated, because the relevant legal provisions have been simplified and amended.
The Lambert report also enables us to achieve our objectives of making another contribution to greater mobility in the European Union and enabling people to take their entitlement to welfare benefits with them when they find employment in another Member State.
That is a contribution to social security in the European Union.
(NL) Thank you, Madam President.
So here we are today at stage two of Mr Corbett's efforts to groom Parliament still better as the lapdog of the politically correct Eurocrat caste.
Yesterday it was decided that we MEPs are scarcely to be allowed to table parliamentary questions, and there is to be a system of self-censure by the President of Parliament.
Today it is being made easier to form groups, and the rapporteur emphatically, and to some degree honestly, acknowledges that this measure is aimed primarily at the Eurosceptic right in Parliament.
So things have come full circle.
Eurosceptic opinion in this House, certainly that on the political right, has to be muzzled.
The Eurosceptic vote in referendums in Ireland, the Netherlands and France is, as usual, simply ignored as if it did not exist.
This is a European version of Mugabe-style democracy. Some democracy!
(FR) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, actually expressed his views, using offensive language, I might add, outside the Constitutional Affairs Committee regarding the political family of which I am one of the representatives in this House; this clearly gives rise to serious doubts as to his impartiality.
The report is highly questionable and its content was drastically reduced in committee; all that remained were arrangements to ensure the survival of politically correct groups whose total number of members would fall below the minimum number required, and an amendment has been sneaked in specifically to prevent our political family from forming a group.
The reasons given are completely at odds with the facts; you need only refer to the annex to the report to see that there is no national parliament where the minimum number of Members required to form a group is higher than 20.
Incidentally, that number is often much lower, at 15, 10 or 8, and in some cases a single person is enough to form a political group.
The Corbett report is therefore an attack on democracy and, quite simply, on the basic rules of fair play.
(NL) This Corbett report has just one purpose, and one purpose only, namely to muzzle the right-wing national voices in the European Parliament.
Mr Corbett's group chairman makes no secret of the fact.
When the ITS Group was formed in January 2007, he said quite openly that the Regulation would be amended specifically in order to block the formation of right-wing groups in future.
Other groups will undoubtedly suffer collateral damage as a result, but Mr Corbett will not lose any sleep over that.
His proposal is probably aimed at a Eurosceptic group.
Clearly it is anathema to the socialists in Parliament that groups of all political colours should have the same means and political rights.
This Mugabe-style thinking is an integral part of the democratic deficit in Europe, in the same way that the democratic verdict of the voters in France, the Netherlands and Ireland is being steadfastly ignored.
Rest assured, Mr President, we shall make this an election issue next year in Flanders.
Mr President, the fact that we voted at all on this today seems to me a breach of this Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
The committee voted down the report because I think the chairman of the committee had miscalculated who was in the room, at which point he simply tore up the rule book and proceeded on an amended version of it.
Why have we gone to such lengths?
What is it that is so important that it requires us to tear up our rules like this?
Well, the answer of course as we know - and the rapporteur has been clear about it - is to prevent Eurosceptics from forming a group.
But why are you so frightened?
What is it that makes you so nervous?
We are only 50, maybe 60 people maximum, out of 785 MEPs.
Could it be that the people you are really worried about are your own voters and that you are sublimating and projecting on to us the contempt and fear you feel for the electorates of Europe who vote 'no' whenever given an opportunity, that you take out on us, their visible spokesmen in this Chamber, what you dare not express about the people who return you to this place.
If I am wrong, prove me wrong: hold the referendums that you once promised.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
(PL) Mr President, I voted against Mr Corbett's report, as I believe it to be a symptom of extreme discrimination at the heart of the allegedly democratic European Parliament, which is trying to use administrative methods to make it impossible to form political groups that do not think or act in the way the majority consider to be politically correct.
This is a two-fold discrimination because administrative methods are being used to stop the formation of groups and, at the same time, considerable amounts of additional financial support are being given to organised political groups, which gives them an additional advantage.
This discrimination goes against the basis of the European Union and the foundations on which the EU is supposed to be built.
I protest most strongly against this move; you should not have any illusions about the fact that even if you are able to carry this through, you will not be able to push it through the nations of Europe, which will definitely object.
Mr President, I have rarely heard such nonsense as I have just heard from the Vlaams Blok, the Front national and Dan Hannan.
This report does not censor anybody, nor would this rule change lead to anyone losing their vote, their right to speak and their right to act as Members of the European Parliament.
What this rule change is about is: at what threshold do you set the figure to enable Members to create a group and thereby access extra taxpayers' money and extra resources to pursue political activities?
Every national parliament that has a group system sets a threshold.
We had a particularly low one - lower as a percentage than almost any national parliament.
It is quite right that we stand back and examine it.
I notice that in the end almost all groups supported the compromise - large groups and small groups.
I notice that the speaker for the Independence/Democracy Group itself - the Eurosceptic IND/DEM Group - proposed an alternative figure of 3%: 22 MEPs.
So they themselves recognise that our current figure needs to be raised, that it is currently too low.
Frankly, is the difference between their figure of 22 and the figure of 25 that has been adopted really an attack on democracy?
Oh, come off it!
(PL) Mr President, Mr Buzek's report provides a detailed appraisal of all strategic measures in the area of energy technology.
Unfortunately, a lack of financing for all the research needed, together with the sudden increase in the prices of gas and oil, meant that we had to direct our research to issues linked to reducing their use for power generation purposes.
This priority will also reduce CO2 emissions and should be included in the strategy.
I believe it is important to promote research into the construction of safe, modern nuclear power stations and into the construction of the newest power stations based on producing helium and hydrogen, as well as on third generation biofuels that can be produced within local areas, easing overstretched fuel costs.
In the voting I supported the amendments that spoke of these priorities.
(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, we have accepted the important report prepared by Professor Buzek.
The European Union's growing dependence on energy imports, which, in 2030, are to reach a level of 65%, has forced us to take steps to ensure the security of supplies of raw materials used for power generation, based on the principle of solidarity.
Additional instruments should also be created to reduce the risks to energy security of individual Member States caused by continuing liberalisation of the energy sector.
In order to reach EU objectives as regards renewable energy and the reduction of greenhouse gases, we must promote the development of new technologies, especially technologies for carbon capture and storage.
It is important to support clean coal technologies and to intensify our activities as regards second and third generation biofuels as well as to increase research into nuclear power.
Work on improvements in efficiency and energy savings has also become much more important.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, I am voting for this resolution.
I am the Development Committee's rapporteur on the Erasmus Mundus programme and my report has recently been adopted unanimously.
I hope that we will be able to endorse the final text in the September plenary, so that the new programme can start in January 2009.
The aim is to export the excellence of our university system beyond the borders of the Union, enabling foreign students to come to study in our faculties - and giving students from the EU an opportunity, through support, to gain experience in a non-EU country.
I believe that Erasmus is a key instrument for sustainable development since, as my report stresses, it should promote the return of students to their own countries and thus contribute, through the fund of ideas, knowledge and international contacts that they have gained, to the growth of their country's economies.
A substantial proportion of financing, in relation to action 2, is taken from the appropriations earmarked for development.
In my view it is necessary to ensure that the financial appropriations for the 2008 annual action programmes for Argentina and Brazil, specifically earmarked for the promotion of economic development and welfare, are actually used for both education and concrete action in the field and that they provide infrastructure and means of production geared to sustainable development.
in writing. - (PT) As it is impossible to mention all the important points in this report, I would like to highlight that after the Irish people's emphatic NO to the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament continues to pretend and act as though nothing has happened.
However, very much to the contrary, as shown by this report's shameless ambition.
Among other aspects, the majority of the European Parliament considers that:
each country's position, that is, their foreign policies should be linked to a binding political platform established by the EU;
the EU should consider a reorganisation and expansion of its offices at the UN, in view of 'the increased powers and responsibilities that the EU's representatives will be expected to exercise with a view to ratification of the Lisbon Treaty';
the Council should define, 'as soon as possible, the operational nature of the EU's observer status at the United Nations';
Member States should agree 'a more cohesive position on the reform of the UN Security Council - one which, whilst maintaining the ultimate objective, within a reformed United Nations, of one permanent seat for the European Union, aims in the meantime at augmenting the weight of the Union'.
Federalism, under the thumb of the great powers, with Germany at the head, in one of its ambitious and clear expressions ...
in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this report and in particular welcomes the strong calls on EU Member States to concentrate and strengthen their commitment towards the Millennium Development Goals.
We strongly agree that the focus must be on meeting the promises made and scaling up the existing procedures.
Labour Euro MPs, however, do not agree with the recommendation for a single EU seat on the UN Security Council and cannot support this recommendation.
We do not believe this would be a good thing for the scale of European representation.
Under Article 19, European members of the UNSC do not explicitly present EU positions in the Council.
Furthermore, the UN Charter itself stipulates that this cannot be the case.
However there is a healthy informal co-ordination process both in New York and more widely, and it is this which should be encouraged.
in writing. - (IT) The Verts/ALE Group has always considered that the European Union should have a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, as set out in the Lambsdorff report.
Our Group does not, however, accept the 'priority' status that has been afforded to the initiative known as the 'Overarching Process' under which there would be an increase in the number of permanent national members and which, in our view, has to be seen as only one of a range of initiatives.
in writing. - I welcome Mr Lambsdorff's report setting out the EU priorities for the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly.
I particularly support the need to continue to push for an ambitious commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) at the Summit.
The EU MDG Agenda should set a global example and we should be pushing for this example to be followed by the rest of the international community at the UN General Assembly in September.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - Today the proposal of Mr. Lambsdorff for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU priorities for the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly was adopted without a vote in plenary.
Not only is this practice - that is enabled by 'rule 90' - very dubious, it also gives the false impression that the whole EP agrees with the content of the report, which is certainly not the case.
We strongly reject the recommendation that the current status of the Lisbon Treaty would call for a 'reorganisation and expansion of the offices of the Council and the Commission in New York and Geneva in view of the increased powers and responsibilities that the EU's representatives will be expected to exercise with a view to ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.'
Not only is this an insult to the Irish voters that rejected the Lisbon Treaty by a wide majority during the referendum, it is also an attempt to interpret the Lisbon Treaty in such a way that it would 'confer legal personality upon the EU', thus making it a superstate.
in writing. - (IT) The Lambsdorff report (and related recommendation) gives a clear political signal for the strengthening of the European Union's profile within the United Nations; taking the Commission and the Member States together, the Union provides the UN with over 40% of its funding, but has not as yet acquired any political sway or capacity of influence in return.
However, one part of the text is misleading and prejudicial to the discussions under way in New York on the reform of the Security Council.
While stressing the ultimate objective of a permanent seat for the EU as such, the recommendation cites, among the various negotiating initiatives, only the so-called 'Overarching Process', an exercise led by those countries committed to supporting only one of the various proposals on the table, i.e. that of an increase in the number of permanent national members.
That proposal, which has been supported by less than one third of the membership, has from the outset seemed divisive and unbalanced, as the President of the General Assembly has himself pointed out.
While we would stress that we very much welcome the political attention that the European Parliament is focusing on the overall strengthening of the European Union's profile in the United Nations, we consider that our reservations and objection to the part of the recommendation on the 'Overarching Process' should be minuted.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, I should like to give a favourable opinion on the Lambsdorff report, which once again highlights the European Parliament's commitment to strengthening the European Union's profile in the United Nations.
I should like, however, to stress that, on the issue of the reform of the Security Council, the report puts forward a value judgment prejudicial to the discussions still under way in New York.
In particular, among the various reform options on the table, mention is made of the 'Overarching Process' (paragraph Q), a proposal to increase the number of permanent national members of the Security Council.
That proposal has up to now been supported by less than one third of the Member States of the United Nations General Assembly.
I would therefore ask you to minute my reservation about this section of the recommendation.
in writing. - (PT) It is worrying that the issue of United Nations reform crops up so regularly.
The need for reform has been recognized for some years, but so has the impossibility of carrying out such reform.
This impasse is serious for two reasons.
First, it aggravates the factors contributing to the organisation's failures, and there are quite a few of these.
Second, it promotes the emergence of a discourse sustained and justified by the need for alternatives.
Strengthening cooperation between democracies is clearly a worthy idea to promote, even though this does not imply comprehensive adherence to the League of Democracies project.
However, it would also be wise to be realistic.
That is why the UN needs to adapt to the realities of power, not so much because of the question of legitimacy but rather because of the question of viability.
Regarding the European Union's role, we must recognise that none of the countries with a seat on the Security Council or that might gain a seat on it agree to their replacement by a single EU seat.
Finally, we have seen that the new United Nations Human Rights Council is a long way from overcoming the deficiencies of its predecessor.
in writing. - (ES) With regard to the recommendation to the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly to be held in September in New York, Rule 90(4) of the Rules of Procedure establishes that a recommendation within the framework of the CFSP, which has been voted on in committee, shall be deemed adopted and be included on the agenda for the plenary sitting without the need for the plenary to ratify the text, and without any debate and amendment procedure.
Therefore, since we are happy with virtually all the document, except for one paragraph, my Group would like to reserve its opinion on the paragraph referring to sexual and reproductive health services.
That concept, which is somewhat ambiguous, incorporates questions which to a large extent are a matter for the individual conscience and morals, and we consider that they should NOT form the subject of any pronouncements on the part of this Parliament, especially in relation to the new session of the United Nations.
Our Group requested a separate vote in the AFET Committee and voted against for the reasons just given.
in writing. - The Lambsdorff report and recommendation are of high political importance in as much as they promote a reinforcement of the European Union inside the United Nations.
It may be useful to remember that though the Commission and the Member States provide more than 40% of the UN budget, the EU impact and influence in the United Nations is still much weaker than it should be.
However, the text of the report contains a misleading part about the discussions which are currently taking place in New York on the reform of the Security Council.
While confirming the long-term target of a permanent seat for the EU, the recommendation quotes among many others only one of the various proposals on the floor, the so-called 'overarching process'.
It is well known that this proposal has turned out to be highly divisive and has obtained the consensus of less than one third of the UN members, as noted by the President of the General Assembly.
Therefore, while expressing a strong appreciation for the overall content and structure of this European Parliament recommendation, I consider it necessary to stress our explicit reservation and objection on the part mentioning the 'overarching process'.
in writing. - (IT) The Lambsdorff report (and related recommendation) gives a clear political signal for the strengthening of the European Union's profile within the United Nations; taking the Commission and the Member States together, the Union provides the UN with over 40% of its funding, but has not as yet acquired any political sway or capacity of influence in return.
However, one part of the text is misleading and prejudicial to the discussions under way in New York on the reform of the Security Council.

While I would stress that I very much welcome the political attention that the European Parliament is focusing on the overall strengthening of the European Union's profile in the United Nations, I consider that my reservation and objection to the part of the recommendation on the 'Overarching Process' should be minuted.
in writing. - (PL) I am very pleased that the European Parliament has today considered the issue of European Union priorities for the coming UN meeting.
The rapporteur's proposal mentions the fact that the UN is looking for 'the establishment of new bodies, the radical overhaul of others, the reshaping of the management of its ground operations, the reorganisation of its assistance delivery and an in-depth reform of its Secretariat'.
This is extremely important.
However, we should not forget that the purpose of all these activities is man and the human rights that flow from human dignity.
Pope John Paul II spoke of this some years ago at a UN forum, saying that the first type of systematic threat to human rights was linked to the area of the division of material goods, which was often unjust; that a second type of threat related to the various forms of injustice in the field of the spirit, and that it was possible to harm a person in their internal attitude to truth, in their conscience, in the sphere of what are called citizens' rights, to which all are entitled without discrimination on grounds of their background, race, sex, nationality, religion or political convictions.
In my opinion, his words should provide a signpost for the activities of the United Nations.
in writing. - (PT) The current proposal forms part of a package (along with the proposals for directives on interoperability and the European Railway Agency) that seeks 'the facilitation of the free movement of locomotives across the EU', as part of the liberalisation of railway transport in the EU.
Before any other considerations, we must therefore emphasise that this directive's main objective is to eliminate any obstacle to the liberalisation of railway transport by harmonising railway safety legislation in each country.
There is no doubt that the most advanced standards regulating railway safety in each country must be adopted and applied.
However, we should remember that the liberalisation and privatisation of the railways was called into question in some countries, for example the United Kingdom, after a deterioration in services and other serious developments led to a rethink of the attack on this public service.
I stress that the harmonisation of railway safety legislation at the community level must never threaten the most advanced laws established in each country, nor should it remove each country's right to keep such laws.
in writing. - I voted in support of Mr Costa's report "Safety on the Community's railways".
The rapporteur's recommendations will help streamline legislation and facilitate free movement of trains across the EU.
These recommendations will cut red tape and should boost the development of rail transport in Europe.
in writing. - (PT) It is essential to harmonise national safety procedures in Member States.
This issue provides one more example of how necessary it is to insist on investment in railway transport.
If we want sustained development of Europe's transport system and if we are going to achieve the goals and respect the commitments made to citizens and also at the international level in recent years, we have to invest in railways and guarantee the interoperability of the European railway system.
Simplification measures and introduction of the principle of mutual recognition are the fundamental points in this report.
Another very important point is the use of more rigorous training and certification measures for all interested and responsible parties in the Community railway market, from railway companies to infrastructure managers.
I think that this report is one more positive step in our search for multi-modality as the main axis of European transport policy.
in writing. - I voted to exempt heritage railways from the scope of this directive.
This continues to reflect my appreciation of the very special case which these companies represent.
Had those companies had to comply with the terms of this directive it would have meant a crippling series of costs on largely volunteer/subscription organisations.
Such railways as the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway and the Kent and East Sussex Light Railway (of which I am a life member) are part of the historic fabric of the tourist industry in the South East of England and across the EU.
It is a shame that some in this House who purport to be 'nationalistic' in leaning could not support this exemption.
in writing. - (PL) The creation of a common railway market for transport services requires changes to existing regulations.
Member States have developed their own safety standards, primarily for national routes, based on national technical and operational concepts.
It is becoming vital to create harmonised regulatory structures in Member States, common texts for safety regulations, uniform safety certificates for railway companies, similar responsibilities and competencies for safety authorities and for rail accident investigation procedures.
Independent bodies for regulating and monitoring rail safety should be created in every Member State.
In order to ensure proper cooperation between these bodies on the EU level, they should be given the same minimum range of tasks and responsibilities.
The protection of public safety and order, which includes maintaining order in railway communications designated for public use, should be one of the basic tasks for which the EU is responsible.
in writing. - (PT) The current proposal forms part of a package of measures (along with the proposals for directives on interoperability and safety) to liberalise railway transport in the EU, in which the 'agency' takes on the central role of 'regulator'.
This policy will promote the gradual deterioration of railway transport as a public service and give the more profitable routes to private companies through privatisation (public-private partnerships), at the cost of the taxpaying public and irrespective of the interests and needs of each country and their people.
In Portugal, as time has shown, implementation of this policy has led to a deterioration in public services, restricted mobility and increased fares.
It has resulted in the closure of hundreds of kilometres of railway track, the closure of stations, a reduction in the number of passengers and in service quality, a reduction in the number of workers employed in the railway sector and an attack on their pay and labour rights.
The railway sector is strategic for socioeconomic development.
We need a policy that promotes the development and improvement of public railway transport systems in our countries.
in writing. - (DE) I voted for Paolo Costa's report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency.
Improving the technical legal framework for the Community's railways as part of the third railway package is an essential and welcome development, which includes measures to strengthen the European Railway Agency.
As the central body, the Agency must ensure that a uniform strategy is pursued throughout Europe.
Particular importance attaches in this respect to the continued development of the European Railway Traffic Management System, the interoperability and compatibility of which must be ensured at all costs.
The creation of an EC verification procedure is a suitable means to this end, but its effectiveness will depend on a robust and efficient European Railway Agency.
For this reason I support further development of the Agency as proposed by the rapporteur.
in writing. - Paulo Costa's report on the establishment of a European Railway Agency notably supports the call for a European Railway Traffic Management System, consisting of the most advanced rail safety technology.
I support this initiative which, in tandem with the "Safety on the Community Railways" report, will allow for a more cohesive European rail network.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (FR) The issue of rail interoperability is critical to the development and the success of Europe's railways.
I am therefore very pleased that we have been able to reach a compromise in the interest of improving Community legislation in this area.
Although I voted in favour of the proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Paolo Costa, I am not any less aware of the limits of this compromise.
Ten years to achieve the certification of all types of rolling stock is a considerable amount of time.
As for the role of the European Railway Agency, it could have been much more extensive, particularly with regard to the development and implementation of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
The Member States decided otherwise for fear of seeing the railway agencies and other national bodies - newly established, it is true - doomed to obsolescence.
However, if this is where we are at now, then it is because, back in 2004, they did not have the courage to give a truly European impetus to the railways.
This is how European integration proceeds: in fits and starts and in small steps.
However, if we adopt this cautious approach, we are likely to miss some opportunities, which is why I hope that the Member States will play the game by rigorously applying what they themselves have proposed.
in writing. - (PT) Reaffirming our critique of its main objective, that is the liberalisation of air transport as a public service within the EU, we would like to remind you of what we pointed out one year ago.
There is an attempt here:
to hide the fact that liberalisation had a negative impact on employment and working conditions.
The effects of this on safety and the maintenance of quality fleets should be evaluated;
to avoid safeguarding full respect for workers' rights and avoid mentioning that:
a) the contracts and working conditions of cabin crews will be regulated by legislation, collective agreements and related rights of the country in which workers habitually perform their job or in which they begin and to which they return after work, even if temporarily deployed in another country;
b) employees of 'community' air transport that provides services from an operational base located outside the territory of the Member States will be subject to the social legislation and collective agreements of the country in which the operator has its main office;
c) participation of representative workers' organisations in the decisions taken on the air transport sector will be guaranteed.
in writing. - (PL) The regulation that has been passed by the European Parliament changes the legislation regulating the provision of air services in the European Union, to the benefit both of air carriers and of passengers.
The Regulation is important for the proper functioning of the internal market.
It creates a more competitive environment for the activities of European carriers that pit themselves against their international competitors.
Through it, the same conditions will be set out for the issue and revocation of operating licences, which should eliminate the distortions of competition that are currently prevalent in the market and which are due, among other factors, to different regulations as regards requirements for operating licences, to discrimination against certain EU carriers because of their nationality, or else discrimination in servicing routes to third countries.
However, the greatest beneficiary of the changes that have been introduced will be the consumer.
By making it compulsory to include all the taxes and additional charges in the price of air tickets, there will be greater price transparency and support for the principle of making additional payments voluntarily.
It will also stop consumers from having to pay higher tariffs and will make it possible for consumers to make informed decisions.
In addition, by eliminating airlines that are financially unsound, passengers will be free from the risk created by the possibility of their carrier going bankrupt.
in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of Arūnas Degutis's report on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community.
Moves to strengthen and improve the existing legal provisions are to be encouraged, especially as regards the transparency of air fares.
Passengers are entitled to a full breakdown of the price of their air tickets.
The new instrument will make fares more transparent and comprehensible.
In this way the European Union is acting to combat misleading advertising and to create a level playing field based on quality, not on the apparent attractiveness of deals, particularly on the Internet.
The measures to ensure compliance with welfare provisions represent another improvement made by the new instrument, giving employees better cover and more uniform working conditions.
The common rules will safeguard consumers' and employees' rights and guarantee the necessary transparency and disclosure of information on the part of air carriers in the Community.
in writing. - (PL) I am in favour of the rapporteur's view concerning adoption of the Council common position without any amendments.
I also think that this Regulation strengthens and improves existing legal provisions concerning monitoring of operating licences, leasing of aircraft, air traffic distribution and price transparency.
in writing. - Arūnas Degutis' report on the rules for the operation of air services in the Community will ensure that the price you see for flights is the actual price you pay.
Final prices for flights must now include fares, taxes, airport charges and other charges.
This is a positive move towards greater transparency in the aviation sector and consumer protection.
Workers in the air services sector will also experience greater social protection under the report's proposals.
I therefore voted in favour of the report's recommendations.
in writing. - I fully support this report, which will put an end to the unfair practice of airlines advertising fares that exclude taxes, charges and a wide range of other extra fees.
The present situation allows airlines to get away with advertising misleading fares that, very simply, prove to be false.
As a result, there is a serious lack of price transparency regarding airfares, which is distorting competition and affecting the consumer's ability to make informed choices.
In many cases, people end up paying a lot more than they originally expected, as the advertised fare bears little resemblance to the final cost.
The Commission and Parliament have worked together to ensure that this will change.
This report will mean that airfares must be advertised simply and clearly, inclusive of all taxes and extra charges.
The European Union's 'crackdown' on this practice is great news for the consumer.
in writing. - (PL) Statistics are widely used, not just by companies or institutions involved in the economy.
They play an important role in planning or following market trends.
For this reason it is important that the indicators used to collect these statistics should be reliable and should properly reflect reality and market changes.
Existing indicators should be reviewed, but consideration should also be given to new areas of data collection.
The need to modernise our statistics results also from the existence of different systems and different statistical practices in Member States, which often makes it difficult to compare data across the whole European Union.
Of course, changes in this area should not increase the reporting burden on companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
The sophisticated approach used in the Programme for the Modernisation of European Enterprise and Trade Statistics should encourage rationalisation as well as the coordination of methods used to obtain statistics from different sources and, what is most important, will mean that companies will not have to supply the same data to different institutions that are involved in data collection.
I believe that the Programme for the Modernisation of European Enterprise and Trade Statistics is a good step towards reducing the administrative burden on businesses, which will help to achieve the target set by the European Commission, to reduce that burden by 25% by 2012.
in writing. - I support Mr Konrad's report on the programme for the modernisation of the European enterprise and trade statistics.
The report seeks to provide investment to improve the efficiency of statistical production so that new demands can be met while business burdens are reduced.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (PL) I am in favour of this report.
Batteries and accumulators that do not comply with the requirements of Directive 2006/66/EC should be withdrawn and should not be allowed to be sold.
The Commission decided that batteries that comply with existing regulations that are placed on the European Union market prior to 26 September 2008 will not be withdrawn.
I consider this to be a very reasonable solution.
The withdrawal of batteries that do not comply with requirements will result in an increase in waste.
I believe that the simplest and best way to deal with this situation is to put stickers on these batteries and accumulators stating that they do not comply with EU regulations.
in writing. - With Mr Ouzky's report the use of two substances 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethanol (DEGME) and 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol (DEGBE) will be greatly restricted and in some cases banned in products marketed to the general public.
The report's recommendations bolster consumer protection and I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (PL) Toxic substances contained in products used for cleaning, rinsing and disinfecting, as well as in paints and solvents, can pose a risk to human health by irritating respiratory pathways and eyes and by causing allergies.
Restricting market access to products that do not fulfil set safety standards could significantly help to protect our health and the environment.
The majority of these products can be harmful in use, causing various unpleasant symptoms.
They can also be harmful to the environment after entering the ecosystem.
Where they pollute the soil or water sources, it is often impossible to predict what the results will be.
Limiting the levels of MEE and BEE in various types of detergents or cleaning products is a very positive step and for this reason I believe that the European Union should make every effort and commitment to eliminate these unhealthy substances from our lives and from the environment.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against this report because it forms part of the gas market liberalisation package and expressly supports steps to complete the internal market as quickly as possible even though it does not, in general, approve the instruments and regulations proposed by the European Commission.
There are some interesting critical observations directed at: the impact assessments submitted; the failure, at times, to observe the subsidiarity principle; and the inconsistent allocation of powers between the European structures.
However, the line taken by the report is to facilitate company access to the natural gas transmission networks, that is, facilitate the privatisation of what is left of the public sector and place it at the service of the strategy of economic groups that want to enter the market.
in writing. - Atanas Paparizov's report on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks will facilitate the integration of the EU internal gas market.
The report tackles cross-border issues between Member States and will increase regulatory oversight at European level.
It is important for the EU to work towards an internal market in gas and I voted in support of the report.
in writing. - (PT) This report deserves a vote in favour from myself and all my colleagues who believed that the consistency of the third energy package depended on the effective and not merely cosmetic regulation of trade in natural gas.
I welcome the willingness to create the conditions to increase investment in gas networks.
In itself, this will allow a potential increase in competitiveness and competition in the sector.
I welcome the efforts towards the effective liberalisation of national gas markets and third party access to the network, which increases the level of transparency.
Finally, I welcome the inherent willingness of this document to put into practice the desire of European citizens to see a more transparent and less monopolised energy market.
The third energy package needs the approval of this report as do our fellow European citizens.
in writing. - The position I have taken reflects my opinion regarding the importance of natural gas and its availability for consumers at the lowest possible price.
A gas pipeline is going to unite Libya and Sicily.
This will pass in the vicinity of Malta so that, in order for my country to benefit, it will have to either join the pipeline or, as has been proposed, there will have to be a pipeline from Sicily to Malta.
My country does not have a large domestic market and its consumption varies between 16 to 18 million units annually.
Should the use of natural gas become more widespread, it will no doubt change the policy on energy in both Malta and Gozo.
This can take place if gas is used in the production of energy itself.
I drew the attention of the then Nationalist Government to the importance of having gas-powered stations some 15 years ago.
The government did not pay any heed and eventually installed only one small gas-powered station as an extension.
Also, as distances in Malta are small, it is feasible to use gas for the propulsion of private and commercial vehicles.
The conversion of vehicle engines is not a problem.
Also gas is much cheaper and much cleaner than petrol or diesel.
But the government and its agency, EneMalta, have not even considered the infrastructure needed regarding its distribution.
The proposal for a directive on the internal gas market forms part of the 'third energy package', which completes the privatisation of natural gas supply services.
The proposal for a directive and the report aim to eliminate the high level of centralisation that still exists in certain countries, in order to complete the penetration of EU monopolies into the market, thus accelerating the implementation of liberalisation, while also imposing sanctions on the Member States that have not yet fully implemented it.
The package has two key points: ownership unbundling between gas supply activities and gas transportation and storage activities, so that capital can effectively make use of that public infrastructure for the production, storage and transportation of gas that remains in the Member States.
The empowerment of supposedly independent regulatory authorities, aimed at eliminating any ability on the part of the Member States to make national adjustments or state interventions, guarantees total immunity for the business groups that will be preying on the gas sector.
This EU policy will have the same dreadful results for employees as the privatisation of other energy sectors: increased prices and a deterioration in the quality of services.
The struggle against monopoly interests to overturn this policy is the only way to meet the current needs of working-class families.
in writing. - (PT) This measure unequivocally demonstrates our shared willingness to achieve the objective of liberalising the energy market.
I therefore vote in favour.
I believe that the ownership unbundling of natural gas production assets and transmission networks is necessary for this, but not per se a sufficient condition.
Hence the concern to create the necessary conditions to encourage transnational investments in network infrastructure.
Hence the concern to demand equal treatment for third countries that intend to invest in the European energy market.
Hence the concern to improve coordination between national energy sector regulators.
This measure will make the market competitive and is therefore in the interests of consumers, who will benefit from the new rules of a more healthy, free and transparent energy market.
in writing. - (SV) I am voting for this report because it will make life easier for people relocating and travelling between Member States, without any powers being transferred to the EU.
in writing. - (RO) I voted for the Lambert report because it is an answer to the citizens' needs.
We are living in a world of globalization where thousands of people are working in another country than their country of residence and we need a coordination of the social security systems for all people using their right to work in other states, in order to ensure and support mobility, which is a fundamental right in the European Union.
Europe allows us to move freely, but it should also provide us with more social rights, which should not stop at national borders.
Hoping that the European citizens will be able to benefit, from the point of view of social security, from equal treatment and non-discrimination, I support the initiative to facilitate the workers' freedom of movement. We have to eliminate all barriers to mobility.
in writing. - (SV) I am voting against this report because it contains proposals for the detailed regulation at EU level of such matters as the payment of Swedish parental allowances, which will create difficulties in individual assessments, and it gives the EU too much power.
in writing. - (PL) The purpose of this document is to make EU rules as regards the coordination of social security systems in individual Member States better and more effective.
The regulations it contains will definitely simplify the lives of the average EU citizen who benefits from the freedom of movement throughout the European Union.
Whether someone is an employee, an official in administration, a student, a pensioner or a businessman, everyone will be able to keep their entitlements to social security payments after changing their country of residence.
I definitely support the ending of yet another obstacle to the free movement of persons within the EU, and this document is another important step in this direction.
in writing. - (FR) I have two comments on the Lambert report and the regulation that it amends.
1.
In spite of the rapporteur's denials, the draft regulation assumes that third-country nationals enjoy free movement, freedom of establishment and free access to the labour market throughout the European Union; it must be remembered that these are all things that, thank goodness, have not yet become a reality.
What it does is chip away a little bit more at the Member States' prerogatives in the field of immigration policy, in other words, their sovereign right to select the foreigners who are permitted to enter their territory and to control the entry, residence and extent of the rights of those foreigners.
2.
It seems appropriate to enable the citizens of the EU Member States to benefit from a coordination of social security systems and ensure that the social protection that they are entitled to expect (owing to their work and their contributions) is not adversely affected by 'international' mobility in which they are encouraged to participate.
However, going all out to ensure, in this area, full equality of treatment between European citizens and nationals of third countries, without any concern for guaranteeing any reciprocal treatment, merely serves as a strong incentive to immigrate that already exists in the form of the enormous, indiscriminate and suicidal generosity of our social security systems.
in writing. - (DE) People's trust in the EU depends to a great extent on their confidence in the social stability of Europe, and that is one of the areas that has seen the greatest changes in recent years and decades.
In practice, because of part-time work and new terms of employment ('McJobs') European employees often end up earning little more than some unemployed people.
The dark side of unbridled economic growth and constant welfare savings is an increase in poverty and social exclusion.
In the European Union, one of the wealthiest parts of the world, 16% of the population were living below the poverty line in 2005.
As a result of the increasing oil and food prices, even more people have subsequently slipped below the poverty line or are now living on the brink of poverty.
The EU must devote itself to combating poverty among its own population as a matter of urgency, and welfare systems must be available primarily for Europeans.
in writing. - (FR) Today, I voted in favour of the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 29 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure regarding the formation of political groups, namely the requirement that a political group's members represent at least one quarter of Member States (instead of the current requirement of one fifth) and that the minimum number of members is 25 (instead of 20), and I did this for several reasons.
Firstly, because I think that this reform is absolutely necessary to enable our institution to operate more efficiently and to put an end to its highly fragmented state, with rules that have remained unchanged despite successive enlargements and the increase in the size of our Assembly since 2004.
In addition, the solution proposed by my Socialist colleague, thanks to whose untiring efforts a compromise was reached with the majority of political groups, seems to me to be very reasonable compared to what is practised at national level within the European Union.
Moreover, given the resources, both human and financial, made available to the political groups by the institution, clear representativeness also seems to me to be enough to justify this change.
Finally, the purpose is purely and simply to promote a certain consistency among political forces at European level; our democracy can only emerge stronger.
in writing. - (PL) This document is yet another attempt by the majority to take over control at the cost of the minority.
The arrogance of the largest political groups within the European Parliament has reached new heights.
The thrust of this document is to increase the minimum number of MEPs required to create a political group from 21 to 30.
Small groups such as, for example, the Independence and Democracy Group are seriously threatened by such a condition.
Obviously I voted against this document.
in writing. - The ALDE Group voted against a reform of Rule 29 for the following reasons:
the existence of the current seven groups causes no real problems of efficiency;
minority opinions have just as much right to be organised professionally as majority opinions;
a decent European Parliament must reflect the wider diversity of political opinion that we find in the Union: we need not copy exactly national parliaments whose job is to supply a government;
closing down smaller groups would either force reluctant deputies to join larger groups, adding to their incoherence, or inflate the ranks of the non-attached, adding to inefficiency;
the size of the Parliament is in any event set to fall from 785 to 751 (Lisbon) or 736 (Nice).
in writing. - (PT) Our vote against this report and the respective commitment is coherent with our defence of pluralism, democracy and respect for different opinions.
It is unacceptable that this report changes the rules for the formation of political groups and imposes more barriers to the formation of political groups in the European Parliament after the next elections.
Until now, a minimum of 20 MEPs from six Member States were allowed to form a political group.
The proposal that has now been agreed requires 25 MEPs from seven Member States to form a political group.
This means it will be more difficult to form small political groups in the European Parliament, which is one more obstacle to the affirmation of positions that differ from those of the dominant ideology in this increasingly neoliberal, militarist and federalist European Union.
One final remark on the process followed by the majority groups, the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups.
They began by presenting a proposal requiring 30 members to form a political group.
They then blackmailed some smaller political groups to gain their support for a so-called compromise proposal, the one that has just been approved.
As far as we, the Portuguese Communist Party MEPs, are concerned, we have maintained, from the beginning, a coherent position against the creation of any additional barriers to forming political groups.
in writing. - (ES) My abstention in relation to this report is because, although pragmatic rules for the creation of parliamentary groups are certainly necessary, I feel that the proposed number of members and of Member States is too high.
If this Parliament is to defend plurality and diversity, it is better for those affected to form a political group rather than swell the ranks of a non-attached group which would become increasingly heterogeneous and inefficient.
in writing. - (FI) The bigger groups originally proposed that 30 members from seven Member States would be needed to form a group.
Fortunately, the project failed in the narrow vote by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in May, when the vote was 15 to 14.
I have also voted against the proposed amendments now, because the small groups will often remain on the sidelines when decisions are made.
It is wrong that a diversity of views should be restricted or the functioning of the small groups should now be made more difficult than previously.
It is also strange in light of the fact that the greatest differences in opinion are often found within the groups.
The largest group, the Conservatives, has split into two or even three groups on many large issues.
in writing. - Conservative MEPs have voted against both of Mr Corbett's proposed amendments to raise the threshold for the establishment of political groups in the European Parliament.
The balance between the efficient operation of the Parliament and the need to recognise the plurality of voices and opinions within the Parliament must be struck with care.
This would be better achieved by retaining the thresholds for the constitution of a political group as they currently are.
Although we recognise there is a fair case for increasing the number of Members required to form a group, any increase in the requirement of the number of Member States would unfairly and unnecessarily disadvantage smaller groups and delegations.
Accordingly, after consideration of Mr Corbett's report, the Constitutional Affairs Committee did not recommend any changes to the thresholds set out in Rule 29.
Conservative MEPs did however vote in favour of the one amendment, originally tabled by Mr Kirkhope, that had been approved by the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
This amendment provides for a more pragmatic and reasonable approach to the circumstances in which a political group may fall below the required thresholds.
in writing. - I support Richard Corbett's report amending the Rules of Procedure regarding the formation of political groups.
With 27 Member States the EU's rules on this issue need to be updated.
The European Parliament cannot justify using millions of euros of taxpayers' money to fund groupings of parties, especially fascists, who come together for nothing other than financial gain.
The European Parliament has the lowest threshold of almost any parliament for constituting groups.
There is no threat to any existing group - nor is the rule change an attempt to squash Eurosceptics, who have more than the new minimum number.
Consequently, I voted in favour of Mr Corbett's report.
in writing. - (NL) The two biggest groups far prefer a two-party system.
The main feature of that kind of system is that the two parties share a common interest, namely that second, third or fourth parties are unable to get a toe in the door of political decision-making and so remain totally irrelevant in the eyes of the electorate.
Only the biggest groups count; protests and alternatives have to be sidelined.
If, exceptionally, others still manage to get into parliament, they are ideally given the most unattractive place possible, as individuals with restricted rights.
Some members of this House do not belong to a group.
That is usually the result of pressure on the part of others.
That same pressure obliges other members to join a group with whose views they partly disagree.
For reasons of self-interest groups take in members even when they know that those members' views deviate significantly from the party line.
The reason is that you cannot form a group here unless you have at least 20 more or less like-minded members.
If all shades of opinion in society are to be democratically represented it is better to do away with that minimum figure, instead of raising it to 25 or 30 and introducing rigid rules against dissenters.
I am totally against that.
in writing. - (DE) There is no plausible reason, in my opinion, to increase the minimum number of MEPs required for the creation of a political group.
On closer inspection, the arguments advanced by the rapporteur are spurious, particularly his reference to supposedly higher thresholds for the formation of a political group in the parliaments of Member States.
If a fair comparison is to be made with the European Parliament, the equation should include only directly elected chambers.
Second chambers generally comprise delegates from federal states or regions, and for this reason they are not comparable.
The average value used by directly elected national parliaments for the formation of political groups is virtually identical to the threshold used by the European Parliament.
In any case, this move to increase the cut-off figure for the formation of political groups is evidently driven by a different agenda.
In committee, for example, the rapporteur referred to the formation of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) Group as an unfortunate circumstance and emphasised the need to prevent any future recurrence.
Because of this attack on democracy and freedom of expression and on the equality of MEPs which is enshrined in the Treaty and in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, I naturally voted against this report.
The report, in its adopted form, complements the unacceptable Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament that aim to control and stifle the powers of those who do not fully subscribe to the EU.
This is a new undemocratic and authoritarian decision that further hinders the establishment of political groups.
The political objective is obvious: they wish to exclude radical forces, especially communist ones, to silence all voices that are opposed and every form of expression that challenges the EU and its policies.
This undemocratic operation was accompanied by the supposed political blackmail by the coalition of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to also push other forces to accept this increase, threatening that, if they did not succumb to it, they would vote in favour of a proposal for an even greater increase in the number of MEPs required, to 30.
The progress of the vote demonstrates that this match has been fixed by the forces of the European one-way street, as an alibi for their undemocratic decision.
The Nea Demokratia and PASOK MEPs and the Synaspismos MEP have voted in favour of this despicable amendment and the decision in its entirety, proving that, on key issues, the forces of the European one-way street are on a common course.
We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, have voted against the increase in the number to 25 and against the report in its entirety, thus denouncing undemocratic machinations and political games.
in writing. - (PT) To make excessive restrictions and create barriers to the formation of political groups can never be a good thing for any parliament.
In addition to possibly being considered a violation of fundamental rights, the effect of such steps is often exactly the opposite of what the advocates intended.
This is therefore a bad reform.
The European Parliament must affirm itself as an essential democratic reference point, both in the European Union and in the world.
It will not achieve this if it falls short of maintaining an exemplary position.
I do not agree that this is the right direction to take.
In addition, more than ever, Europe needs to continuously maintain the confidence of its citizens, all its citizens, in its institutions.
All Europeans must feel they are represented, independently of their political positions.
That is why this is a bad and untimely reform.
I vote against.
in writing. - (SV) I am opposed to all attempts to reduce democracy and diversity of opinion in Parliament through such measures as altering the number of Members and Member States entitled to form political groups.
Despite this view, I voted for the compromise amendment of the Corbett report.
The reason is a pragmatic one - it was the only way of voting in order not to risk a decision which would be even worse from a democratic point of view and which would make it more difficult to form a political group.
in writing. - (PL) Today the European Parliament accepted an amendment to the Rules of Procedure, as a result of which the guidelines for the formation of political groups will change.
Following the elections in June 2009 political groups in the European Parliament will have to consist of at least 25 Members representing a minimum of 7 Member States.
I would like to give my full support to this increase in the threshold for the creation of political groups in the European Parliament, as this will help to avoid excessive parliamentary divisions and will make its work more effective.
Both the cohesion and the effectiveness of Parliament have suffered as a result of the excessive number of small groups in the House.
However, to strengthen democracy, small political groups need to be protected against temporary reductions in the number of members, if they fall below the required threshold.
in writing. - (SV) We voted for the report, since better cooperation and more openness between national courts/judges and the EC Court of Justice is of the utmost importance for the working of the European legal system.
It must be made more transparent and its application improved through better training and facilities for networking and exchange of knowledge.
However, we consider that the discussion in paragraphs 26 and 27 regarding the jurisdiction of the EC Court of Justice in certain areas is a Treaty matter on which the European Parliament has already stated its opinion.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against this report because of the unacceptable pressure it will put on Member States, including our national judges, who are the cornerstone of the judicial system in any sovereign country.
This report makes clear what was intended with the so-called European constitution and the defunct Treaty of Lisbon, which it seeks to revive in a truly anti-democratic way.
The report itself affirms the intent to establish a single European legal order.
To achieve this, they want 'to involve national judges more actively in, and accord them greater responsibility for, the implementation of Community law'.
National judges play an essential role as guarantors of the rule of law, including Community law.
However, the principle of subsidiarity and constitutional issues in each Member State cannot be called into question in the name of 'the primacy of Community law, direct effect, consistency of interpretation and state liability for breaches of Community law', as intended by the Commission and the majority of the European Parliament.
It is unacceptable to continue with this pressure, now that the Treaty has been rejected.
in writing. - (FR) This report is completely frank with us.
Right from paragraph 1, it sets its goal: the establishment of a single European legal order.
Indeed, this report, a veritable pamphlet in favour of Community law, seeks to involve national judges more actively in and accord them greater responsibility for the implementation of Community law.
Accordingly, it is suggested that Community legislation and related case-law be integrated into national codes as soon as possible.
The report proceeds with the idea of merging national and Community legal systems without, at any time, raising the issue of excessive Community standards, their confused wording and their frequent lack of consistency.
This move towards the simplification and codification of Community legislation is certainly a good thing.
The same applies to the adoption of regulations to ensure legal certainty; I am thinking in particular of those relating to harmonisation of the rules governing conflicts of laws.
However, the case-law of the Court of Justice often proves to be unsafe for the enforcement of national laws that are subject to the Court's binding principles and dogmas even if they are clearly contrary to the best-established legal traditions of the Member States.
in writing. - (PT) 'Friends, friends, business aside'...
I refer to one more contradiction between the EU and the United States, this time in the aircraft industry where, despite the 1992 agreement on government support, each side tries to defend its interests, because that is how capitalist competition operates.
The European Parliament complains that 'the EU has consistently adhered to the spirit and letter of the 1992 Agreement and has regularly provided documented evidence of compliance' while 'the US has largely ignored its obligations', 'unilaterally purported to withdraw' from the agreement and brought 'a WTO case against the EU, citing European repayable financing which fully complied with the 1992 Agreement and which is similar to that benefiting Boeing'.
At the same time, faced with the 'bitter attacks' by Boeing and the US Congress, against the contract awarded to Northrop Grumman Corporation EADS for the US Air Force aerial tanker recapitalisation programme, the European Parliament seeks to pour oil on troubled waters, by pointing out the need to 'to arrive at a pragmatic balance between European civil support and the US military-industrial scheme'.
It seems that not all countries are entitled to sovereignty and 'free trade'...
in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report, not because I enjoy WTO disputes or have a paranoia about the United States, but because I am fed up with the protectionist actions of the United States over many years, particularly in the area of civil aviation.
The Americans have perfected the art of whinging and complaining about other countries and their lack of free trade, when they themselves have adopted measures which allow bankrupt airlines to carry on trading, and have allegedly sifted millions of dollars of aid into Boeing.
The International Trade Committee is right to support the EU in its case against the United States at the WTO.
What we all should be aiming for here is fair and open competition between aircraft manufacturers with a freedom of choice for airlines to choose the best aircraft to suit their needs at the best price.
The official motto of the USA is 'In God we Trust.'
Perhaps that should change to 'Don't do as I do.
Do as I say.'
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish social Democrats voted in favour of Mr Buzek's report on the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan.
We take a positive view of CO2 capture and storage but question whether it is necessary to support such things as coal to gas conversion for the further development of that technology.
We also take a positive view of research into and the development of new sources of energy with low or zero CO2 emissions.
We are in favour of the Union cofinancing this research, but do not think that we should pre-empt the budgetary process by calling on the Commission at this stage to set aside particular sums.
We have therefore chosen to abstain on these two points.
in writing. - I am voting against the second part of Paragraph 26 because I do not support Nuclear being one of the priority initiatives.
However I will vote in favour of the report because its objective is to accelerate innovation in cutting edge European low carbon technologies.
It is crucial that Europe has an energy research plan to support its ambitious energy policy and climate change goals.
in writing. - (PL) I agree with Mr Buzek's views as regards the issue of introducing new power generation technologies in the light of the challenges facing the European Union, namely environmental protection, guaranteeing the security of energy supplies and maintaining the European Union's high level of competitiveness.
I also agree with the point made by the rapporteur concerning insufficient resources allocated to new power generation technologies in the current financial framework of the European Union.
We must remember that success in the area of new power generation technology should be achieved by a partnership between the public and the private sectors.
in writing. - (DE) As we know to our cost, the EU's aim of rapidly increasing the percentage use of biofuel has had adverse repercussions.
Monocultures, the felling of rainforests and competition with food and feed crops, which has contributed to the current food crisis, have seemingly prompted the EU ministers to think again and have dealt a blow to their target of increasing the share of renewables in the production of motor fuel to 10% by 2020.
While we should welcome the fact that biofuel is no longer to be produced from food crops and that there is a general desire to wait for second-generation biofuels such as those obtained from waste products, this must not lead in any way to a relaxation of EU efforts in the domain of renewables.
The alarming upward trend in the price of oil makes it more important than ever to promote the production and use of energy from renewable sources.
All those billions that are being spent on nuclear power generation, with all its problems, must be invested in renewables.
in writing. - (FR) Sovereign wealth funds, these state-owned funds that are invested all over the world, are they a good or a bad thing?
Rather a good thing, if we are to believe this resolution.
However, it is true that a Europe that is stagnating economically on account of its own economic and monetary policies cannot afford to dismiss the thousands of billions of euros of potential investment that they represent.
It is true that, for the time being, sovereign wealth funds do not disturb the financial markets (they have even come to the aid of the US banking system) and would tend to be directed more towards long-term investment.
However, that may change. We are all aware of the opacity of most of these funds with regard to the scale of their resources, the distribution of their assets, their governing structures and their investment strategies that range from ethical investment to the pursuit of high yields, positions of control and perhaps the potential to cause serious damage in the future.
The states that hold these funds are not all friends of Europe, far from it.
One of them has already evoked the threat of its 'financial nuclear weapon'.
However, we shall abstain on this text instead of voting against it because, although it supports the free movement of capital worldwide, it cautiously calls for some monitoring of and protection against these funds.
in writing. - This resolution covers an important subject.
Sovereign Wealth Funds are playing an increasingly important role in global trade and investment.
Some of this is positive but that is not always the case as the unaccountable administrations make decisions that maximise short-term profits at the expense of countries, communities and families.
We must look at ways of increasing transparency and accountability to these resources that often outweigh those available to nation states.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, Mr Rack's report on a new culture of urban mobility, in favour of which we have voted, is an important part of the new comprehensive approach of the Commission's energy and climate package: significant reductions in emissions can be achieved in Europe using sensible, efficient community and transport planning.
It must, however, be taken into account that the Member States are different in their geographical locations and living conditions.
It is precisely for this reason that I voted in favour of the two amendments by our group.
I come from a country of long distances and comparatively small towns.
It is quite clear that the opportunities for reducing private motoring are significantly weaker in, for example, the sparsely populated urban communities of Finland, in the north, than in the densely populated areas of Central Europe.
in writing. - (DE) I voted for Reinhard Rack's report on a new culture of urban mobility.
The draft report on the Green Paper is an important contribution to the subject of urban development.
The economic development of a town or city and its accessibility depend on better mobility, but the latter must not be achieved at the expense of people's wellbeing or the environment.
For this reason, the report ought to give more consideration to social factors and employment policy.
It must also be rooted in awareness that the diversity of the Member States will not permit a uniform European solution and that strict adherence to the subsidiarity principle must therefore continue to prevail.
I also believe that, in the countries where liberalisation has already taken place, its impact on employment should be assessed.
In addition, I call for a certification system for the retrofitting of particulate filters to cars, goods vehicles and off-road vehicles.
While the Green Paper highlights most of the problems that affect urban mobility today and also presents some new and innovative ideas for solving them, it falls far short of covering all the aspects that need to be addressed and so can only be regarded as a starting point for the discussion of this issue.
in writing. - (PL) The most important matter raised by the rapporteur is that of delineating the areas in which the European Union should participate in issues relating to urban mobility.
The rapporteur is right to point out that there are similar problems throughout the European Union in the area of urban mobility, but it is not possible to develop a uniform method to deal with these problems.
At this point, the rapporteur's views concerning the town or city being able to choose a method to achieve set objectives is sensible and I would like to express my support for these views.
in writing. - (NL) Towns and cities are densely populated, with few open spaces and a lot of traffic travelling relatively short distances.
With space at a premium there just is no room for heavy motor traffic, and excessive noise and air pollution are further reasons to make us try to limit the number of cars in our towns as much as possible.
Of course towns must be accessible to the fire service, the police, ambulances, removal vans and the vehicles of persons with limited mobility, but scarce open spaces must be kept primarily for use by pedestrians, cyclists, trams, children's playgrounds and parks and gardens.
Only then is the town somewhere you can live in.
The text being voted on today does not make that clear choice, but simply seeks to reconcile opposing interests and ideas.
Fortunately the EU has no competence in this area.
All the EU can do is help to foster best practice, good experience which has been built on and improved.
Such improvements are important not only for the town which has already made them, but also as an example to others.
Examples include central London's congestion charging system, the new tram networks in Strasbourg and Bordeaux or the long-established restricted-traffic city centre of Groningen.
Unfortunately the EU will contribute hardly anything on the back of this report.
in writing. - (DE) I voted against this report, because the EU is not responsible for these matters.
It does nothing for legal certainty and brings Europe no closer to the people when Parliament takes the initiative to produce reports on matters that do not fall within the regulatory competence of the EU.
in writing. - (SV) We voted for Olle Schmidt's report on the ECB annual report.
However, we would point out, with reference to the passage in the explanatory statement which speaks of the need for Sweden to introduce the euro, that we respect the outcome of the Swedish referendum in 2003 in which it was decided that Sweden would retain the krona as its currency.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against this report because it reaffirms support for the work of the European Central Bank, makes no criticism of successive increases in the base rate, even though this has already reached 4.25%, much higher than the United States Federal Reserve base rate.
Moreover, the report ignores the fact that the bank's activities are harming workers, the population in general and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
It only serves the objectives of the major economic groups and finance capital, even when they cause problems for the more fragile and dependent economies, such as that of Portugal.
For example, in Portugal, where the level of debt has reached 114% of GDP, this increase, allied to the overvaluation of the euro, is another nail in the coffin of micro and SMEs, worsens the deficit in the balance of trade and increases the country's dependency.
It will be more difficult to deal with unemployment, casualisation, low wages and the generalised increase in prices, considering that the level of debt of Portuguese families has now reached 129% of their disposable income.
We therefore reaffirm the need for a break with this right-wing policy and the false autonomy of the ECB, which only serves to hide the fact that it is at the service of big capital.
in writing. - (FR) The Schmidt report is the annual pat on the back given by Parliament to the European Central Bank for its benevolence.
As usual, it seems to miss the key point: the dreaded margin squeeze that is crushing Europeans' purchasing power and for which the ECB and the European Union are partly to blame.
No one believes that the official inflation figures (3% for 2008, according to the report), which are merely composite indices, reflect the reality of the rising cost of living for citizens, especially for commodities, energy and housing.
Everyone recalls the statements made by the ECB authorities, warning against the inflationary effects of wage increases, as if the salaries of those same Europeans were not subjected to constant downward pressure because of unfair global competition and the immigration policy promoted by the European Union.
With regard to the highly overvalued euro exchange rate, it is true that it is sparing us the worst in the face of rising oil prices.
However, it is threatening the competitiveness of many industries which are tempted to relocate, as Airbus has done, to the dollar zone.
We therefore cannot support this mutual back-patting.
in writing. - (PL) In his report on the ECB annual report, the rapporteur has focused on the challenges facing the Bank.
There has been a great deal of worrying information for European economies over the past few months; and unfortunately there is much more of this than in 2007.
The crisis in financial markets and the sudden increase in the price of oil and food are slowing down economic growth and increasing inflation, and there are concerns about a rise in unemployment figures.
The ECB will be one of the leading institutions that have to try to deal with these challenges.
The steps taken in August 2007 provided liquidity to financial markets, but they did not resolve the problem.
There is also an increase in the number of countries joining the common currency.
Slovakia will be the first country from Central and Eastern Europe to take this step.
However, Slovakia will definitely not be the last.
Entry into the euro zone by the other new EU Member States seems to be just a matter of time.
The experiences of Slovakia in this regard will no doubt be closely observed by countries in the region that are also thinking about joining the single currency.
The rapporteur is also right to note that different levels of economic growth, different indicators of growth or different levels of maturity in EU economies could create problems for the ECB's decision-making process.
For this reason I believe the suggestion to undertake a review of possibilities as regards making changes to the decision-making process to be a sensible one.
Such a review should include not just the present members of the euro zone, but also future and potential members.
in writing. - I welcome Olle Schmidt's report on the ECB annual report.
I join the rapporteur in calling for the ECB to continue to improve its relationship with other central banks and relevant institutions.
Indeed, I would also echo Mr Schmidt's recommendation that caution should be taken regarding further interest rate rises so as not to endanger economic growth.
I voted in support of the rapporteur's evaluation.
The resolution that we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, have voted against attempts to provocatively portray the 10-year implementation of the EMU and the establishment of the euro as a great 'success', while workers and the poor working-class sections of society in EU countries, including Greece, are experiencing their dire consequences, such as high prices, the wages and pensions freeze, unemployment, excessive taxation on employees and poor self-employed workers and the removal of employment, social and democratic rights.
Any 'success' achieved relates solely to the profits and surplus profits of European plutocrats and runs absolutely counter to the interests of workers and the people.
The European Central Bank, as a pure instrument of European capital, is required to play a more active and effective role in that direction through anti-popular measures, such as interest rate increases and so on.
However, the remarks and concerns of the resolution on the monetary 'turmoil' and the 'cohesion' issues of the EU that remain and are, in fact, becoming more widespread, confirm our assessment regarding the continued and unavoidable crises of the capitalist system and of its disproportionate growth, as well as regarding the need to overthrow it and replace it with a planned popular economic system with power to the people and the need to cut the ties with the imperialist EU.
Within the EU there can be no path to growth that prioritises the common people.

Presentation of the programme of the French Presidency (debate)
The next item is the Council statement on the presentation of the programme of the French Presidency.
President Sarkozy, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament as President-in-Office of the Council.
(Applause)
I am aware that you are joining us here today after a long journey from Japan.
Welcome to the European Parliament, President-in-Office.
(Applause)
I should also like to welcome the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, who, like the President-in-Office of the European Council, has just returned from Japan.
It was a tiring trip, so I shall make no further preliminary remarks.
- President-in-Office of the Council, I would like, without further ado, to invite you to take the floor before the European Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to address your Assembly at such a critical moment for Europe.
I am well aware that we all bear a heavy responsibility.
Of course, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have a great responsibility, but the responsibility of all pro-Europeans is the same.
How do we get Europe out of the crisis in which it finds itself?
How do we prevent immobility?
How do we overcome our disagreements and use them to serve the same European ideal?
Here we stand at the heart of European democracy.
Each one of you, having the honour of sitting in this Parliament, has had to win the support of your compatriots.
There are men and women of the left, of the centre, of the right; there are elected representatives from 27 countries.
However, today we must turn our differences into a strength for an ailing European Union.
We must make these differences an opportunity to reassure European citizens, who are worried.
We must keep democracy alive, which means that we must engage in debate and at the same time create an image of a Europe that rejects immobility.
Everyone must be on board in the European family, with its 27 Member States; nobody must be left behind.
We are just a few months away from an important date for the European Parliament.
It is reasonable for everyone to be conscious of this.
At the same time, we must give the impression this morning of a Europe that is working for everyone.
I have seen easier situations than the one in which Europe now finds itself.
If I may speak freely, conscious that, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must speak on everyone's behalf, I have to take account of everyone's sensibilities and at the same time come up with the right answers.
First observation: we have an institutional problem.
Heads of State or Government have tried to find a compromise with the Lisbon Treaty.
No one said that the Lisbon Treaty was going to solve all of our problems, but it was and remains the expression of a compromise acceptable to everyone.
I myself, as President of the French Republic, had to face up to my responsibilities.
France voted 'no' in 2005 and this caused a problem for France.
Ladies and gentlemen, the issues that we have to address are very difficult and complex; let us try to give everyone the idea that we are working on this with no ulterior motives and no preconceptions.
That is what is expected of us.
(Applause)
Before the elections, I offered the French people parliamentary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
Before the elections, I said that I would not hold a referendum in France.
I said this to the people of France in a democratic spirit; it was a choice I made three days before I was elected, which could have been highly significant.
I do not regret that choice.
I truly believe that institutional issues, the way in which we do things in Europe, are something for members of parliament rather than for referendums.
It is a political choice that I am making (applause) and it is a political choice that I made in my own country before the elections.
Therefore, it is perfectly democratic.
We now have the problem of the Irish 'no' vote.
It is certainly not for a Frenchman to pass judgment on this outcome considering the earlier Dutch and French 'no' votes.
Therefore, on 21 July, for the first time as President-in-Office of the Council, I will go to Ireland to listen, engage in dialogue and try to find solutions.
The French Presidency will propose a method and, I hope, a solution in agreement with the Irish Government, either in October or December.
The problem is this: we must avoid both rushing our Irish friends and yet at the same time establish under what conditions and with what treaty we are going to organise the 2009 European elections.
We therefore have a bit of time, but not that much.
We owe it to our fellow citizens to know on what basis we are going to organise the European elections.
The basis will be either the Lisbon Treaty or the Nice Treaty.
There will not be a new institutional conference.
There will not be a new treaty.
It is either Lisbon or Nice.
May I add, just to be perfectly clear - it is my opinion, but that does not make it the truth - that I am one of those who have always supported European enlargement.
The 2004 enlargement was a success.
The family is back together; we should not regret that.
However, I am one of those who have always wished that Europe had been wise enough to create new institutions before enlargement.
That was a mistake and we are paying for it today.
It would have been braver to establish institutions before enlargement.
I want to be perfectly clear on this.
Of course I do not regret enlargement.
The family must stay together.
However, I am adamant, President Pöttering, that we must not make the same mistakes again.
If we stick with Nice, it is the Europe of 27.
If we want enlargement - and personally I do - we need new institutions before enlarging.
Who would have thought that Europe, with its 27 Member States, would be incapable of establishing its own institutions and that it would have no other priority than to keep on enlarging?
Things have to be clear: if we want enlargement - and we do want enlargement - then we need new institutions.
(Applause)
Let me add - and I am saying this to Mr Schulz - that I am in favour of bringing in the Balkans, that our Croatian friends, like our Serbian friends, are unquestionably European.
However, the most pro-enlargement countries cannot say, 'we do not want Lisbon', yet at the same time, 'we want enlargement'.
It is Lisbon and enlargement.
It is not blackmail, because in Europe, we do not do blackmail.
It is a matter of consistency, honesty and logic.
When it comes to Croatia, therefore, we must continue the negotiations, but everyone must shoulder their responsibilities.
If Europe is to grow, and it must, then it must do so with new institutions.
Another point: here and there in European debates I come across people saying, 'well look, it does not matter if we have a multi-speed Europe.'
Perhaps one day we will unfortunately have to have a multi-speed Europe, but that can only be a last resort.
Europe has paid dearly for being divided by a wall of shame.
Europe has paid dearly for the dictatorship imposed on 80 million Europeans.
Let us think hard before we leave anyone behind.
When we were negotiating the Lisbon Treaty in Brussels, France fought to ensure that Poland could take its place in the Lisbon Treaty.
How can we tell 38 million Poles that it is much easier to shake off the yoke of the dictatorship that they were under, and from which they freed themselves, thanks to high-calibre people such as Lech Walesa and Jean-Paul II, than to remain in a free Europe?
There are 27 members in this family.
Nobody should be left behind.
We must bring everybody in the European family on board; that, at least, is what the French Presidency will work towards.
(Applause)
Regarding other issues, and I believe that we can reach a consensus on them, nothing would be worse than for Europe to give the impression of being immobile because it is going through yet another an institutional drama.
That would be an awful trap for us to fall into.
We reject institutions that condemn us to immobility, but at the same time, Europeans are impatient because they think we are too immobile.
Notwithstanding the institutional problem, perhaps even because of the institutional problem, Europe has a duty to act, and to act now.
This is the message that the French Presidency would like us all to send to Europeans.
We are in the process of resolving the institutional problems, but we are not condemned to inaction.
What, then, are our priorities?
The first is to show Europeans that Europe can protect them.
Now I would like to say something about this word 'protection'.
Since ancient times, whenever people have elected a government, it was so that this government would protect them.
Mr President, Europe must offer protection without protectionism.
Protectionism gets us nowhere.
Seeing European citizens today think that Europe, which was designed to protect them, is a source of concern rather than protection, is a real step backwards.
Therefore, it is up to us to show how Europe is going to protect them on concrete issues.
The first is the energy and climate package.
If there is one area in which our nations can do nothing if they act alone, it is in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet.
When it comes to pollution, CO2 and the ozone layer, the borders between our countries are irrelevant.
The stakes are high: since the meeting of IPCC experts, we have realised that we are the last generation that can prevent disaster.
The last generation!
If we do not do anything now, future generations may be able to limit the damage, but they will not be able to stop it.
Every country in the world says: 'I am willing to do something provided that the others start first.'
With this type of reasoning, our grandchildren's grandchildren will never see any decisions made.
If we Europeans wait for others to do something before we act, we could be waiting a long time.
We created Europe to take our model of civilization to the world and to defend our values.
Among those values is the certainty that the world is doomed if we do not take a decision right away.
Europe must set an example.
Europe must lead by example.
We have a goal: the 2009 conference.
This conference must manage and organise the post-Kyoto phase.
Europe must come to it united, having decided to adopt the energy and climate package.
If we do not, we will not have any leverage to get the Chinese, Indians, emerging countries and Americans to make the efforts that we have agreed on.
Therefore, it is essential that, under the French Presidency, we adopt the energy and climate package submitted by the Commission.
(Applause)
It is a demanding package, it is a difficult package, but I would like to appeal to everyone's sense of responsibility.
If every country starts wanting to renegotiate its own particular bugbear, the things it has a problem with, then, ladies and gentlemen, we will never reach an agreement.
This is why the French Presidency is asking the European Parliament to rally behind it so that we can get the energy and climate package adopted within the next six months.
That is a priority.
It is not a right-wing or a left-wing priority, it is simply common sense.
If we go into negotiations Member State by Member State, we have no chance of succeeding.
Now, of course, there are points that need to be clarified or adapted.
I am thinking in particular of a very difficult matter: namely the problems for our firms, on which we are rightly going to impose rules to maintain the balance of the planet.
Should we, in Europe, impose essential rules on our firms and, at the same time, continue to import products from countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we impose on our businesses?
That is not a matter of protectionism; it is a matter of fairness, justice and refusing to be naive.
There is the problem of deciding on a border mechanism.
Should there be free quotas or adjustment mechanisms?
I do not know, but, in any case, we have to discuss it.
(Applause)
Second question: I understand that, for some countries - I am thinking particularly of those that joined us in 2004, which largely rely on fossil fuels for their energy - the efforts demanded of them are considerable.
These countries are telling us, 'we have had growth for 10 years; please do not take that away from us.'
No doubt there is a way to get everyone on board and, with the President of the Commission, we have to work on it so that everyone realises that they will not be doomed to recession, misery, poverty and unemployment.
This energy and climate package is an absolute priority for us.
The world cannot wait;
Europe has to lead the way.
Second point: of the 27 countries, 24 are now in the Schengen Area; in other words, 24 countries out of 27.
23, you say?
OK, 23 then, but that is still not bad.
This does not include countries that are not members of the European Union but - and this is why we often have debates - are part of the Schengen Area.
So what does this mean?
It means that we have decided on complete freedom of movement between the Schengen Area countries.
I would like to say to the leaders of the political groups and to members of parliament that we in France, with Bernard Kouchner and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, have taken a decision that was not easy to take.
Since 1 July, there have no longer been any barriers preventing access to the French labour market, because I have announced that I will abolish all of the restrictions negotiated by my predecessors.
Any worker from any EU country can come and work in France.
(Applause)
It was not that simple; it was not that easy.
In any case, and French MEPs will correct me if I am wrong, I was told that it would be a disaster if I announced this decision.
As usual, we made the decision, and no disaster materialised.
I was not happy about the dispute over the infamous 'Polish plumber', which did not give my country or indeed Europe a very good name.
That is not why we all built the European Union.
(Applause)
Nevertheless, now that we no longer have any borders between us, is it fair, is it reasonable for each of us to go on deciding our own immigration policy, taking no notice of the others' constraints?
The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum is an essential document for the French Presidency, for two reasons.
The first of these - and may I turn to the left of the Chamber first - is that if all of us, if all European countries have a European immigration policy, we remove immigration from national debates where extremists use poverty and fear to serve values that are not ours.
The only way to have a responsible debate on immigration is to make it a European policy.
No more partisan ulterior motives compelling countries with different sensitivities to work together.
What Brice Hortefeux suggested, which was approved by all ministers and should be discussed by the Permanent Representatives Committee and by the European Council, seems to me a priority.
It will show that Europe does not want to be a fortress, that Europe is not refusing to take people in, that Europe needs migrant workers, but that Europe cannot take in everyone who would like to come to Europe.
Let me add that, when it comes to political asylum, it is not logical for one individual to be able to submit 27 applications to 27 democratic countries and not get the same answers every time to the same problem.
Let me add that, for development with Africa, we will be stronger if we work together; this is the second priority of the French Presidency.
Third priority: we want to further a concept often talked about in Europe, but which is making slow progress, and that is European defence.
I am well aware that there is a lot of disagreement surrounding this issue, but let me tell you what I believe.
How do you think Europe can become a political power and make itself heard if it cannot defend itself and deploy resources in support of its policy?
Take the example of Kosovo, which to my mind is a European Union success story.
This is a European problem, which has to be settled by Europeans.
How can Europeans continue to do that if they do not acquire the military and human resources to enforce the decisions that we have taken together?
How do you think that Europe can become the most prosperous economic area in the world if it is unable to defend itself?
Yes, we have NATO.
It would not occur to anyone, least of all me, to dispute the usefulness of NATO.
It is not a matter of choosing between a European defence policy or NATO, but of having NATO - the alliance with the Americans - and an autonomous European security policy.
It is both of these together, not one instead of the other.
Let me add that we cannot go on having Europe ensuring its security based on the contribution of just four or five countries, with the others relying on the efforts of these four or five countries.
The Member States cannot keep on building their own aircraft separately, having armaments industries that compete with each other to the point of ruin and ultimately are weakened, simply because they are not strong enough to have a European defence policy.
Fourth priority: the extremely difficult issue of the common agricultural policy.
I am coming now to my conclusion, which is linked with this.
It is precisely because it is difficult that we need to talk about it.
I am perfectly aware that among us we have agricultural States that fiercely defend the work of their farmers and, at the same time, States that think that this policy costs too much.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I appeal to your common sense.
In 2050 the world will have 9 billion inhabitants.
Already, there 800 million people who are dying of starvation.
A child starves to death every 30 seconds.
Is it reasonable to ask Europe to reduce its agricultural production at a time when the world has such great need of foodstuffs?
I do not think that this is reasonable.
It is not about French agriculture; it is about common sense.
(Applause)
Let me add a second point: regardless of whether your country is an agricultural one, food security concerns everyone.
Is it reasonable to impose, rightly, traceability and safety rules on our breeders and farmers and go on importing meat into Europe which comes from other countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we are imposing on our farmers?
(Applause)
Third point: agricultural prices have never been so high.
It is precisely the right time to talk about prices, to talk about subsidies and to talk about Community preference.
I also think that between the common agricultural policy's health check and financial arbitration, we might be able to agree on certain concepts such as food sufficiency and food security for Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a host of other topics: the social dimension, for example, is a huge issue.
May I make one point.
Sometimes I see a certain contradiction: a single-minded view sometimes exists that Europe should not meddle with everything and that Europe should intervene only in areas that concern it.
However, the same people who accuse Europe of poking its nose into everything are the first to speak up when we do not talk about the social dimension.
Until now, the Member States have always wanted social policy to be first and foremost a national competence, because pensions and healthcare are primarily national issues.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of social directives that President Barroso did well to put on the agenda.
I am thinking of those on works councils, temporary work and a number of basic rules which have to be imposed on everyone in Europe.
The French Presidency will make this a priority.
Other subjects too should be put on the French Presidency's agenda, even though they are not within Europe's remit.
Let me take an example of something which affects us all: Alzheimer's disease.
(Off-mike comment from Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'not yet').
Mr Cohn-Bendit, it would never have occurred to me that someone so young as you should already be affected by a disease which, although it does not affect you, affects millions of Europeans.
These millions of Europeans are just as important to me as your health.
(Applause)
Of course, subsidiarity means that this is not a European competence.
Nevertheless, I would like the French Presidency to organise a meeting of all specialists from all European countries so that we can share best practice, so that our researchers can pool their skills to find out more about this disease and so that together we can find a solution.
Just imagine what Europeans would say about Europe then: it is a way of curing these awful diseases.
What I said about Alzheimer's could apply to cancer, which breaks families apart.
There is no reason for everyone to work on their own on finding solutions to cancer when together we will have more resources and be stronger.
(Applause)
Finally, with regard to culture and sport, let me say that it is a big mistake not to talk about the issues that affect the day-to-day lives of Europeans.
There is a European cultural exception.
We must make culture a part of everyday debate in Europe.
The world does not have to bow down to one language and one culture.
We must clearly address the question of VAT on videos and CDs, like that of VAT on books, which you have settled.
On sport, which transcends political divides, let me just say that I would like there to be a sporting exception in Europe, just as there is a cultural exception.
I am in favour of the freedom of movement of individuals and goods, but I do not accept the idea that we should make our football clubs pay, undermining the investment that many clubs make in teenage boys, who need to stay with the club for training purposes.
A sporting exception, which would mean that sport is not beholden to the market economy, should have the support of all MEPs.
(Applause)
To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to finish - apologies for having been too long, no doubt - with a final observation.
I know where I am going to make this observation: where the heart of European democracy beats.
Europe has suffered a great deal.
It has suffered first of all from the cowardice of some of us, who were very happy to let Europe pay for responsibilities which were really those of political leaders, unwilling to make in public the choices that they refused to defend in Brussels.
(Applause)
That is cowardice.
I say this to the President of the European Parliament and to the President of the Commission: the Presidency will work hand in hand with you.
If any Member State does not agree, let it speak up.
As I said to the Polish President, he himself negotiated the Lisbon Treaty, he gave his word, and one's word has to be honoured.
It is not a question of politics, but a question of morals.
(Applause)
However, Europe has suffered from something else too.
Europe has suffered from a lack of debate.
I would like to end with this because it is very important to me.
Our institutions are independent, but independence does not mean indifference.
If we, the political leaders, do not have the courage to debate, who will?
To debate what?
What is the right economic strategy?
What is the right monetary strategy?
What is the right exchange rate strategy?
What is the right interest rate strategy?
Of course everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and I say this to our German friends in particular.
However, no one has the right to prevent a debate, a constructive debate.
Of course everyone wants an agreement, such as the trade agreement which is in the process of being negotiated.
However, no one must be afraid of saying that Europe must not be naive.
We have to discuss the advantages of free trade, but we must also tell emerging countries that there are no grounds for them to demand the same rights without taking on the same obligations.
We must not be afraid to hold a European debate.
We must engage in a dignified European debate, but we must not be afraid to defend our beliefs.
We are not questioning the ECB's independence when we ask whether it is reasonable to raise interest rates to 4.25% when US interest rates are at 2%.
We are having a debate.
A peaceful debate, where no one has a monopoly on the truth.
I certainly do not, nor do the experts, who have to demonstrate the effectiveness of their decisions.
It is in this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, that I intend, together with French ministers, to shoulder this responsibility.
I know that it is difficult.
I know that, when you are President-in-Office of the Council, you are not defending the interests of your country, but the interests of the Union.
I know, Mr President, Presidents, that we have to work as a team in the interests of the Europe of 27, and I hope that in six months' time everyone will be able to say: 'Europe has made progress thanks to your participation and support.'
(Loud applause)
Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, thank you for your speech.
We wish you continued courage, determination and especially success throughout your Presidency - as, when you are successful, the European Union is successful and, with it, the European Parliament.
You can be assured that the European Parliament is at your side when you make your resolute contribution to taking the European Union forward into a good future.
The European Parliament will support you in this task.
I should also like to welcome the ministers with you today: Bernard Kouchner, Brice Hortefeux, a former fellow Member, and especially your Minister of State for European Affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who is almost always here in Parliament.
I welcome you all most warmly to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be here with you today in the European Parliament for the presentation of the six-month French Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
I think that this will be a presidency full of drive and determination and rich in concrete results that we will all work towards.
You wanted France to come back to Europe, President-in-Office, and this is unquestionably excellent news for us all.
European citizens and the European Parliament assembled here today expect a great many things from the French Presidency.
As I said during our meeting in Paris on 1 July, the Commission will stand by the French Presidency, offering its full support to ensure the success of the European Union during these six months.
There will be no shortage of challenges.
Globalisation is here to stay and international competition is becoming increasingly tough.
The world faces new challenges such as the scarcity of fossil fuels and climate change.
We must act now to find common solutions to these challenges.
All of these factors mean that Europe needs to reform its economies to become more competitive, modernise its social models and invest in education, research and innovation.
Europe has many aces up its sleeve, particularly as one of the world's leading trading powers.
However, it must have the courage to adapt.
If we want to offer protection, we must adapt.
That is the key.
There is no point in denying that Europe is going through a difficult period: the Irish 'no' vote and the global economic climate, soaring oil and commodity prices, the sharp rise in food prices and inflationary pressures, which are the greatest enemy of purchasing power.
Inflation is also the greatest enemy of social justice as, when there is very strong inflation, those who suffer most are those on low wages or living on a pension.
All of these factors are casting a shadow over our economies and forcing our politicians, at both European and national level, to make difficult choices.
We must confront these realities head on and apply ourselves to them with realism and determination.
We have just come back from the G8 summit in Japan, where I could clearly see that the influence enjoyed by the European Union, as well as the expectations and respect that it engenders around the world, are in marked contrast with the gloom that is often expressed within the EU.
I can tell you now that, now more than ever, the European Union is seen outside Europe as a positive and decisive player, a player with enormous influence on the world stage.
Let us take two concrete subjects that were at the centre of the G8 summit: climate change and development - two issues on which Europe has taken the initiative at global level.
The United States has now joined us in the fight against climate change by largely subscribing to our views.
Last year in Heiligendamm, I remember that we had great difficulty - President Sarkozy was there - in convincing the Americans and the Russians to accept the principle of mandatory targets for 2050.
Now we have achieved this.
It was possible thanks to our role as European leader; I am proud of this as President of a European institution.
It is a success that we yet again owe to European unity.
The second example is development, and specifically soaring food prices, which threaten all of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
We were also able to act as a catalyst in this area thanks to the conclusions of last month's European Council, which, and I quote, welcomed 'the Commission's intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries.'
The European Commission will adopt this proposal next week.
I am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that Europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers, particularly those in Africa, in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations.
This support is essential to guarantee 'the green revolution' that Africa needs for its stability and prosperity, which, as you all know, is also in Europe's direct interests.
As the European Council requested, our proposal will remain within the limits of the current financial perspective.
Our approach consists of allocating the savings that the rise in international prices allows Europe to generate as part of its agricultural support policy to those who are hit hardest by this increase.
There are emergency and disaster situations all around the world.
If you could have heard what the President of the World Bank said, if you could have heard some of the leaders of African countries and other countries represented in enlarged meetings talk about the hunger and starvation that now represent a real threat to so many people in the world, you would understand to what extent European aid is necessary and indispensable.
(Applause)
This is why I believe that, yet again, we can set a good example of solidarity between European and African farmers, illustrating the fact that the common agricultural policy (CAP) and development policy can and must work in tandem, because, as President Sarkozy has just said, food security is a global issue and we need to tackle it together.
Not alone, but together.
Therefore, it is true that there are concerns, but it is also true that, more than ever before, the European Union has a central role in resolving them.
Rather than wallow in what I sometimes call 'crisisophilia' - there is even talk of the phenomenon of declinism in Europe - let us emphasise the value of the concrete and positive action of the EU.
In any case, this is the best way of resolving the international issues raised by Ireland's non-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
We must address this because the Lisbon Treaty could make us work more effectively, more democratically, although we must not use it as an excuse for failing to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens.
European citizens are looking to us for answers.
The best response we can give them is to talk to them frankly and show that we have political courage.
The French Presidency has both qualities in abundance.
In a Europe on trial, we must provide evidence that Europe works.
We must focus on policies that bring Europe closer to its citizens and change their daily lives.
More than ever before, we are plotting a course for a Europe based on results.
Personally, I am confident.
The priorities of your Presidency will allow Europe to meet the major challenges that it faces, while preparing for the issues of the future.
I welcome the priority given by the French Presidency to the introduction of an integrated energy and climate change policy.
As you said, President-in-Office, this is the top priority of your Presidency, and we know how determined you are to finalise this strategic agreement by the end of the year, which would put the EU in a good position to embark on the Copenhagen negotiations in a year's time.
The Commission will lend its full support so that we can reach an ambitious and balanced agreement with the European Parliament and the Member States.
I have made this a priority for my institution, and I would like to thank the President-in-Office once again for his tireless support for the energy and climate package unveiled by the European Commission.
We must also move towards a policy of controlled immigration in Europe.
We must first address immigration, which an ageing Europe needs, in certain key economic sectors, and which must be accompanied by proper integration so that we can be proud in our humanist Europe of the integration that we offer to those who genuinely want to come here to work.
The adoption of the 'blue card' under the French Presidency would be an important step in this direction.
However, we also need to tackle illegal immigration and the exploitation that often arises from this, particularly by furthering the proposal to penalise those who employ illegal workers.
It is here that we must effectively make the most effort; we must not threaten the poor workers who only want to work in Europe, but penalise those who want to exploit them.
This practice is a disgrace to Europe.
Let there be no mistake: we must be realistic in addressing the issue of immigration.
I am firmly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that our inability to address this issue seriously and responsibly is one of the greatest threats to Europe.
We will not solve the immigration issue by being permissive on all fronts.
This would be the best excuse for extremist forces, for xenophobic forces.
We need to be tough on illegal immigration, and at the same time show that we are generous and united in the integration of migrant communities who want to contribute to Europe's growth and development.
I believe that we need to be clear on this; we need to be tough on crime while continuing to show respect for human rights, which are the trademark of European civilisation and our plans for European integration.
Naturally these are sensitive issues, which are easy prey for polemic and misunderstanding.
This is why the Commission wanted to put forward a balanced proposal and why it has outlined 10 key principles so that we can go forward together.
I was delighted to see the French Presidency and the French justice and interior ministers endorse this integrated approach during their informal meeting in Cannes this week.
I am keen to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that in Europe, in the Schengen Area, where freedom of movement is a reality, it is absurd to continue with 27 different immigration policies.
What we need is a European immigration policy.
Also in the pipeline is our Social Agenda.
There can be no dynamic, competitive economic model without genuine social investment to prevent the risks of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation.
France has made the new Social Agenda unveiled by the European Commission a few days ago one of its priorities.
I welcome this.
To prepare Europeans for the future, we must offer them opportunities, access to quality services, education, healthcare and continuing solidarity.
Nobody in Europe must be left by the wayside.
Europe is all about opportunity and solidarity.
Ladies and gentlemen, many other projects will be launched over the coming six months.
I cannot describe them all here, but if I can briefly outline two, I should like to commend the projects for European defence and the Union for the Mediterranean, which will be unveiled next Sunday in Paris.
I see these as two opportunities for Europe to affirm its role in the world.
Here too, it is up to us to translate this ambition into concrete action.
I wish the French Presidency of the Council every success, guaranteeing the full support of the Commission throughout the next six months, which promise to be exciting.
The first duty for politicians is to face up to challenges and redouble efforts to meet them successfully.
We can do a great deal together.
I would like to pay tribute here to the efforts made over the past few months by French Government at the highest level to work closely with the European institutions.
The institutions, the Presidency and the Member States must all work hand in hand.
This is the key to the joint success that we owe the citizens of Europe, and I would like to pay tribute to the commitment expressed here again today by the President-in-Office so that together, the Council, Parliament and the Commission can find concrete solutions to the concrete problems that our citizens have to face each day.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, France has decided that its Presidency will be synonymous with political commitment.
We need political commitment to overcome the difficulties faced by European integration.
The most entrenched of these is without doubt the Irish 'no' vote, discussed here this morning.
We must engage our citizens in Europe.
There are many reasons why they have doubts, including fears linked to globalisation, rising prices and changes in traditional family and social values.
If we cannot convince everyone that major issues such as security, climate change, energy and migration can be negotiated effectively only at European level - and with regard to the world's major regions, Europe must also be strong enough to convince the United States, India, China, and Brazil - we cannot envisage a peaceful future.
The French Presidency will also need political commitment to convince its partners that the Lisbon Treaty will help us decide more effectively and democratically on all of these common issues.
Those members of my group who belong to the European People's Party would like all Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the Treaty during the French Presidency.
After a period of reflection and with all due respect, we look forward, as we did with France and the Netherlands, to Ireland offering its 26 partners a solution to the impasse.
We ask each Member State to refrain from any one-upmanship and to act responsibly.
Our group would like to see an end to this institutional debate and we are confident that the French Presidency will work towards achieving this goal.
Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, while we are trying to equip ourselves with a better decision-making tool, our problems are building up.
This is consuming energy that could be better spent on job creation, defending our interests and promoting our social model and Europe in general.
As I said, we will certainly need political commitment.
We should also make sure that we have the commitment to address the priorities that the President-in-Office of the Council has just unveiled.
We must act urgently to tackle the issues of climate change, energy, migration, food security and defence.
On climate change and energy, the alternative is clear: either our Member States are convinced that they must progress and set an example ahead of the Copenhagen Summit, and if so, we must make clear decisions before December to ensure reciprocity from our international partners, or they have decided that, despite worsening climatic conditions and our energy dependence, there is no need to take urgent action.
I hardly need tell you which way my political group leans.
On migration, too, we want an end to this hypocrisy.
While a number of countries around the world have already adopted an immigration policy with fairly satisfactory results, most of our countries have delayed these choices.
It is time for a debate and a decision on the subject, which must be positive, humane and responsible.
The draft European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which will be debated in October, is a step in the right direction, and I congratulate the EU ministers on their response this week to the draft prepared by Brice Hortefeux.
You have our support, Mr Hortefeux.
Finally, I would like to mention two topics that are very close to my heart and are vital for the future and for our independence: food security and defence.
I would like us to think of the most disadvantaged people, both around the world and in our own countries, for whom rising food prices are a real problem.
I would like Europe and the French Presidency to make an effort to help them through these difficult times.
In terms of defence, I would just like to ask one question: how can Europe be credible without defence worthy of the name?
We need defence to guarantee peace in Europe and to help the world's most disadvantaged people.
Our group supports the commitment of the French Presidency to lead the way by making bold proposals to its partners in these two strategic areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, European integration is an eminently political affair.
I am in no doubt that, if we are brave enough to make clear political choices, our citizens will rediscover a liking for Europe.
I have every confidence that the new Presidency will encourage us in this and we have everything to gain in winning the trust of our citizens ahead of the 2009 European elections.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are aspects of your views that we share, Mr Sarkozy, and I should first like to go into some of these in more detail.
I am delighted that you have returned from Japan safe and sound.
We have now heard again about the next series of commitments on climate change and it is time we delivered on these.
You are right that the climate package is a priority: it is one that our group shares with you.
You are right, too, when you say that individual states cannot achieve this on their own - not even the Germans and the French, by the way, by reaching agreements on their own in Straubing.
There are 25 other countries that are part of this and, above all, it is the European Parliament that makes the final decision.
We shall do it with you, cooperatively, but do not take any initiatives on the side - not even with Angela Merkel, however good an idea that may seem to be.
Since you mention sport, I had a look at the French newspapers this morning, wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy's visit to the European Parliament.
Nothing!
They write a lot about the Tour de France, and it is a German who is wearing the yellow jersey there at the moment.
(Heckling)
I listened closely to you, Mr President-in-Office, as you made your other points, about climate change and particularly about the Treaty of Lisbon.
Indeed, if we want to deliver, we need instruments, and that puts us in a dilemma.
The citizens want us to be more effective, more transparent, more democratic, and they want the national parliaments to be more democratic and have more influence.
That is all correct but, every time we want to deliver, the instrument we need - a revised treaty - is snatched from our hands.
You are right: this means that we need a new approach, a fresh start.
We need to try to bring this Treaty into force.
I think it is great that you are going to Ireland and working constructively with the Irish people.
If I may give you a personal tip, leave Bernard Kouchner behind in Paris this time.
I had the impression that his previous contributions did not exactly help us to convince the Irish.
(Applause, heckling)
However, I am speaking about a matter on which we hold completely the opposite view to you.
You spoke of four priorities for your Presidency, and I was waiting to see if there was a fifth.
You then mentioned several other things you said were important - not priorities, just other things.
These 'other things' included a social Europe, which you said was a matter for the nation-states.
I believe that is a serious error.
(Applause)
I want to tell you that we expect a different approach from the French Presidency.
A social Europe does not mean that we want to establish a social security office in Europe or that we want to bring in family allowance in Europe.
A social Europe is about something else: for a long time, people have believed - and rightly so - that Europe can make economic progress possible.
We have spent 50 years working to ensure that economic progress in Europe leads to more growth and more jobs, and always to a guarantee of more social security.
More and more people are now feeling that quite the opposite is true - that Europe's economic progress is benefiting a few large conglomerates, certain insurance companies, hedge funds and large enterprises, but not the people.
It is the task of the European Union to restore to them the feeling that growth in Europe, the economic progress of this continent, does not serve the banks and the large conglomerates but each individual citizen.
Furthermore, if the nation-states have to guarantee this, then you as President-in-Office of the European Council are obliged to tell your fellow Heads of State or Government that they must make sure that social justice, rather than free-market radicalism, takes centre stage in their nation-states.
(Applause)
I should like to add that we have a European Court of Justice that delivers verdicts every day, and its verdicts can change the degree of social welfare in the individual Member States even though the Member States do not have any instruments with which to resist.
This is why we need a social Europe, Mr President-in-Office, and this is why I expect you to change your mind on this issue by December.
Otherwise, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not be able to support you.
Mr President-in-Office, fears about social exclusion lead to dangerous developments, and one dangerous development is that governments that are on the defensive believe that they can take people's minds off this fear of social exclusion by hounding minorities.
We are currently seeing this in one European Union Member State.
I do not know what percentage of the Italian population is made up of Roma children, but I do know that when a government goes and says 'they will be registered as by a police records department; they must have their fingerprints taken', supposedly in order to provide them with social protection, that is a grave offence against Europe's fundamental rights.
Your country, France, gave the European community of nations its first charter of fundamental rights.
The first declaration of human rights came from your country.
As President of that republic, you are part of the tradition of your country.
I ask you, in your role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to influence Silvio Berlusconi's government, and tell it that Europe is a community founded upon the rule of law, not a union of caprice.
(Loud applause)
The European Union faces many major challenges but, if we do not guarantee social welfare in Europe, people will turn away from this Europe and, when they turn away, the Treaty of Lisbon will not be of any use; the whole project will fail.
We need courage, therefore.
I know that you are a courageous man.
We support your priorities; now support ours - a social Europe and climate change, institutional reform and human rights.
Then your Presidency will be successful.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would put it to the President-in-Office that the Irish vote against the Treaty has made his impressively prepared presidency more problematic.
It has also made the case for a practical, problem-solving Europe stronger than ever.
The energy and climate packages become more urgent every day.
Capping VAT is a short-term sop: Europe should be cutting its dependence on oil and gas.
We need much more investment in renewable energy: small-scale and localised to bring household bills down, and large-scale, such as using the Union for the Mediterranean to invest in high-voltage solar thermal power production in North Africa.
On Tuesday the G8, which is the source of nearly two thirds of the world's CO2, approved an emissions-reduction target of 50%.
But the emerging economies are right to say that the target should be higher - perhaps 80% - with interim targets.
To stabilise food prices we need good ideas, such as the recent CAP reforms of Commissioner Fischer Boel, not protectionism, however disguised.
The truth is that people care more about the petrol price and the bread bill than about the grand aims of our Union.
Today nobody should say 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche' ('Let them eat cake').
The President-in-Office is right to put the focus on migration.
But migration will be manageable only when we manage the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here.
There should be routes for legal migration, a crackdown on people-smuggling, and reform of our farm policy to kick-start growth in the countries of origin.
It may be optimistic to ask a French presidency to liberalise markets.
But to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them.
There is another way in which the French presidency can break new ground.
France gave us the Rights of Man.
Now France must lead in their defence.
At home, by pressing ahead with the anti-discrimination directive.
Abroad: by anchoring peace in the Balkans in a European Union future; by using the Union for the Mediterranean to improve human rights in North Africa; and by uniting in our dealings with Russia and condemning China's crackdown on dissent.
(FR) President-in-Office, do not go to Beijing.
Play a team game.
(Applause)
It was Voltaire who told us: 'Mortals are equal; it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference.'
And by taking a lead, Europe can demonstrate its virtue and demand that the dignity of every man and woman be recognised.
President-in-Office, to succeed, you will need to build consensus.
You will need Parliament, Council and Commission to work together to a common agenda set by 27 Member States and this House.
If we are to argue, it must be about that agenda, not its messengers.
You have plunged into a polemic with the President of the ECB and with two Commissioners, but they represent our Union and the policies we have agreed.
It is not the European way to divide and rule.
We must stand on our principles but work together to achieve our common goals.
(FR) Mr President, I know I am coming to the end, but please give me 'soixante petites secondes pour ma dernière minute' with Carla Bruni's husband.
(Laughter)
President-in-Office, if you stand on your principles and let us work together to achieve common goals, if you do that, Liberals and Democrats will work with you.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to bring citizens closer to Europe there is a need, as I said in the European Convention for the new treaty, to give Europe a soul, that respects the various languages and identities, reaffirming common roots and values, and you have tried to express that soul in your speech today, President-in-Office.
As Strasbourg is symbolic of renewed peace, so today the European flag flies alongside the national flags, and should be a visible representation of the symbol of all citizens united by a common project for defence, security, cultural and economic growth, and the transparency of the Central Bank: perhaps that is still missing from the new Treaty.
Politics needs to give young people definite goals.
There can be no economic future without respect for the environment and there can be no respect for rights without recognition of the associated duties.
We hope that the French Presidency includes in its objectives the European Charter of Duties.
Democracy and freedom are based on the application of rules.
The internet cannot be a tool of terrorism, child traffickers and incitements to violence.
We need to harmonise our countries' laws, from immigration to the protection of minors, from energy to compatible progress.
A new Europe for a new relationship with Africa.
Not just green certificates or trade but mutual growth, jointly sharing the Euro-Mediterranean project; we must think of the pockets of terrorism in Mogadishu and the violence in Zimbabwe that are preventing the development of democracy.
There is too much hesitation within the EU: we are asking the Council to approve 'made in' so that international trade can have clear rules.
The fight against counterfeiting and illegality is an economic problem but it also affects our citizens' health, and small and medium-sized enterprises are a cultural value that should be defended.
We offer the French Presidency our staunch support so that hopes may become reality shared by the citizens and so that, possibly, by supporting the development of scientific advances to combat rare diseases, we can also combat our intelligent friend Mr Schulz's endemic antipathy towards Prime Minister Berlusconi.
Mr President, your European voluntarism, your ambition for Europe is a challenge that we share in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
I would even say, to paraphrase a song that you know, 'it is a drug we are all hooked on.'
However, there is one thing that I would like to say.
If we are ambitious enough to say that we must accept the climate package as it is one minute and that we will bow down before the German car industry lobby the next, then we have lost, because everyone will come and say: 'do not forget about us'.
This is the problem.
We cannot complain about petrol being too expensive, yet at the same time allow the car industry to build gas-guzzling vehicles.
We have had the technology to build energy-efficient cars for 15 years now, but because there are no rules forcing manufacturers to do this, consumers are now paying for petrol at the price it is.
This is the truth of the matter; this is how things are.
(Applause from the centre and left)
You mention the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum.
Let us have a European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, then.
Initiate a dialogue: for legal emigration, let the European Parliament take part under the codecision procedure so that we have a genuine political debate, a genuine democratic debate.
I am fed up, Mr Daul, because whenever we talk about emigration, after 15 seconds we start talking about illegal immigration, the threat of immigration.
First of all, if Europe is what it is today, it is thanks to the men and women who have built it with us.
That is the truth.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Please, I am no angel, but we have built a house with no doors.
People are coming in through the windows.
I say to you: 'Let us throw open the doors so that people can come into Europe, and then we will decide what to do about those who come in illegally.'
You say to us: 'We need skilled workers', yet at the same time, Europe sends home tens of thousands of students each year who have come here to study.
Let them stay here; if they have studied here, they are not illegal immigrants.
Now turning to the points on which you said that the social dimension is not within Europe's remit.
President-in-Office, you will not protect Europeans if we do not work together to combat social and fiscal dumping.
We need Europeans to face up to this problem.
We need to put a stop to it, and we stand by you on this.
We need to have a discussion with the Central Bank?
Let us have a discussion, then.
We need to have a discussion with the Irish?
Let us have one.
We must stop saying that the social dimension is not part of the European remit.
This cannot continue.
(Applause from the centre and left)
I now wish to turn to the issues on which we are deeply divided.
You are going to China to attend the opening of the Olympic Games with the Chinese President.
I hope you enjoy it!
Personally, I will be thinking of all the prisoners rotting in Chinese prisons.
I will be thinking of all those who have been arrested.
I will be thinking of all those who are being mistreated in Tibet.
You had a golden opportunity to defend the European values of democracy and liberty by saying, 'I will not attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, this masquerade of the Chinese Communist Party.'
This is what we want to hear.
(Applause from the centre and left)
I can tell you that when you come to write your memoirs, you will regret what you have done.
You will regret it because the people who locked up these innocent citizens will be saying to them, 'You see, we can do what we want: the Western world only wants our markets.'
Mr President, it is a disgrace, it is pathetic, to go to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to focus my speech on the twofold nature of this French Presidency, namely its unquestionable strong point and its all-too-obvious weak point.
Its strong point, in relation to the usual tenors of the Union, is that it does not say that Europe is doing well and that it should continue along these lines when increasing numbers of Europeans think that it is doing badly and that things should change.
So far so good.
But what then?
This is where the problem lies.
What conclusions do you draw, Mr President, from this apparent lucidity about the crisis of legitimacy that the Union is experiencing today, in particular its economic model and its operating mode?
You say that you want to understand and that you respect the concerns that Europeans have about the Union, but you put pressure on the Irish people to go back on their decision, when they were only voicing, like the French and the Dutch, what millions of other Europeans are thinking.
You criticise, rightly, the way the European Central Bank has been managing the euro from its ivory tower, but you never recommend re-examining the statutes which grant it all those powers and even assign it this task!
You state, on the subject of immigration, that you want to 'serve our values', but you supported the shameful directive, condemned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, by all human rights organisations and by European churches, precisely because it violates essential human values.
You ignore the social question - which, you say, should remain the sole responsibility of Member States - but you say nothing about the European Court of Justice, which delivers ruling upon ruling placing the different social models within the Union in competition with each other and basing itself on Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty.
You say that you did not like the image of the 'Polish plumber'.
Neither did I. This was an expression coined by the populist right and made popular on television screens by Mr Bolkestein.
I say 'Welcome to workers from all countries' on an equal footing in all fields.
(Applause from the left)
This is precisely what current European law refuses.
President-in-Office, may I remind you that, according to the Commission, in Lower Saxony, for the same work on the same construction site, a worker from another Member State can be paid half the minimum wage applicable to a German worker.
This is what we do not want.
Do you know what a man who cannot be accused of populism, namely John Monks, Secretary-General for the European Trade Union Confederation, thinks?
He considers these decisions 'considerably problematic' because, he says, they decree 'the primacy of economic freedoms over fundamental rights and the respect of labour law.'
What is your answer to that?
You claim that you want to build a 'Europe which protects', but we do not hear you criticising all those structural measures which make the existence of Europeans precarious: the obligation to open public utility undertakings to competition; the pressures of the Stability Pact on wages and social spending and the number of 'guidelines' prepared by the Commission and adopted by the Council, which you apply in your own country with zeal.
I could mention Guideline No 2: the reform of pension, social security and health care schemes.
Guideline No 5: labour market flexibility.
Guideline No 13: the removal of regulatory, commercial and other obstacles which hinder competition unduly.
And I have not mentioned all of them.
The reversal of France's - and Italy's - position has just enabled the Council to go beyond the obligations that it set itself by agreeing on a draft Directive permitting a 65-hour week.
This consecrates Dickens as the new father of Europe!
One last word, Mr President: this weekend, in front of your European guests - the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and in front of 2 000 French right-wing business executives - you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement - and a very unwise one - by stating that now, when there is a strike, the French people no longer even notice.
The day after this lofty event, your Minister for Education explained that this was 'a way of reassuring our European partners in the presence of the most eminent among them.'
Well then, if you must insult the trade unions to reassure European leaders, it is definitely time for change in Europe.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President of the Republic of France, in their daily lives the people of Europe unfortunately have to cope with the disastrous effects of the policies of the European authorities in Brussels and Frankfurt.
The people of Europe are seeing more and more every day that all of their powers are trickling through their fingers, that their freedoms are being taken away, whether it be purchasing power, an expensive euro, GMOs, tax, fisheries, a lack of trade protection, immigration, or even football, which you yourself mentioned a few moments ago.
Everything is trickling through their fingers, and I would say, Mr President of the Republic, President of the European Union, that everything is trickling through your fingers.
You say so yourself, you point it out as a criticism.
Well it is high time to act and to bring your actions in line with your words.
A moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference, and you are right.
However, let me remind you that it was removed by the Marrakesh Agreement, which you approved, and it is not in the Lisbon Treaty, which you drew up.
You deplore the irresponsibility of the Central Bank, and you ask for a debate to be started.
As for us, we want decisions.
Perhaps I can remind you here that this independence of the Central Bank, this irresponsibility that we see at work every day, was organised and formalised by the Maastricht Treaty.
You regret having obtained the agreement of Brussels for a drop in oil taxation, but that is simply a consequence of the Treaties of Nice and Amsterdam, which you ratified through the parliamentary route.
In short, you complain today and every day about the effects of what you encourage every day, in other words stripping away the powers of the State for the benefit of post-democratic forums, made up of officials, bankers and judges.
Your Presidency of the European Union is a historic opportunity to get Europe moving in the right direction again, a Europe rooted in the freedom of nations that respects democracy.
This is why we are asking you to honour the vote of the Irish people and to pronounce the Lisbon Treaty dead.
It is not the European people who have to reconcile with Brussels, it is Brussels that has to reconcile with the European people!
(Applause from the speaker's group)
(FR) Mr President, here you are invested for six months in the rotating and brief role of President of the European Union.
Unlike the majority of the French electorate, you have shown yourself to be zealously pro-European, even going as far as presenting once again, in the barely different form of the Lisbon Treaty, the Constitution which, along with the Dutch, the French people rejected in 2005.
Alas, your plans have hit a snag in the form of the will of the Irish people.
The Lisbon Treaty is therefore void, despite all the schemes that it would seek to impose on the European people, the will of the ruling euro-globalist camarilla.
As a young member of parliament, in 1957 I voted against the Treaty of Rome, the first stage of a process which, according its promoters, Monnet and Coudenhove-Kalergi among others, was to lead to the United States of Europe: this Tower of Babel that can only be built on the ruins of the nations, and first of all of my homeland, France.
Since then I have been resolutely opposed to it.
We are told that globalisation is bringing about fundamental changes everywhere, that we must submit to.
In reality, however, all over the world the nations are gaining strength, supported by fervent patriotism, apart from in just one area - Europe - where nations and homelands are sacrificed, dismantled and demoralised for the benefit of a project that has no strength and no identity, while waves of foreign immigrants gradually invade it and the opening up of our economic borders leaves it open to furious competition from the rest of the world.
None of the promises made to the European people in order for them to accept the loss of their independence, their sovereignty, their identity and their culture have been kept: neither growth, nor full employment, nor prosperity, nor security, and the predominant feeling is of anxiety as we stand on the brink of a looming systemic crisis: energy, food and financial crises.
In the meantime it is true that the media circus will continue.
Yesterday, the European football championship, the tennis at Roland Garros, tomorrow the Olympic Games in Beijing, and today, the miraculous saga of an icon, Ingrid, who laughs, cries, prays and comes and goes on your brotherly arm!
In your desire to be the liberator, you got involved in the negotiations with the FARC terrorists, but it was not you or Mr Chavez who freed the Colombian Senator Mrs Betancourt.
It was President Uribe who persistently, against the general movement of global progressivism, won a decisive victory over criminal terrorism.
You made repeated futile attempts and you even went as far as inviting the repentant communist FARC terrorists to come and receive asylum in France; but to protect them from whom?
From President Uribe, the democrat?
As you have gone this far, why not the Taliban, Hezbollah or the Tamil Tigers?
You are like the amphisbaena that was so dear to Césaire.
Have no doubt, Mr President, all your talents in orchestrating the media will not be sufficient to ward off the imminent dangers that you will have to face before the end of the year.
Our Europe is a vessel that is going off course, battered by the wind and waves, the only region in the world that has deliberately dismantled its political and moral structures, that has no borders and is gradually being invaded by mass immigration that is only just beginning!
Economically ruined by ultraliberalism, socially impoverished, demographically weakened, with no spirit and no defence force, it is doomed at best to be a U.S. protectorate, and at worst to the servitude of dhimmitude.
It is high time to abandon the fatal illusion of federalism and build a Europe of the nations, united by more tangible alliances that will undoubtedly be more modest, but more effective.
The dual failures of the Constitution and the Treaty should serve as a warning.
The people of Europe do not want anything to do with these plans and will not allow them to be imposed on them because they do not want to die.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your speeches.
I would first like to thank Mr Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his support and that of his group, which will be invaluable to the French Presidency.
I agree with your analyses and am sure you will understand that I will not go back over each of the points, even though your commitment regarding a defence policy is entirely necessary.
Mr Schulz, allow me to say that I appreciated the sense of responsibility in your speech.
As with Mr Daul, we met and had discussions, and there are no secrets.
Democracy should not be a shadow theatre.
It should enable us to compare our ideas and try to reach a compromise.
You can be sure that, as in the case of Mr Daul, the French Presidency appreciates the support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and your support on matters of consensus.
Moreover, I do not see why I would say that this support is of less use to me because it comes from the Chairman of the Socialist Group, or why you would seek out conflicts with the Presidency under the pretext that I am not of the same political persuasion as you.
Allow me to say that regarding the energy and climate package, I am perfectly aware, and I also say this to Mr Daul, that it is Parliament that will have the last word; but better than that, it is not just a question of having the last word.
It is the mobilisation of Parliament that will put pressure on the Member States that do not have the same ambitions as Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency.
I would not say, Mr Schulz, that you will have the last word.
I am saying that your commitment is absolutely critical.
I would also like to say to Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is not about getting down on bended knee in front of anyone, especially not the car industry, be it French, Italian or German.
Why just target the German industry?
In this case, the President-in-Office of the Council has to take into account the legitimate interests of each of the Member States.
What we have to do is resist the industrial lobby while allowing it to have fair conditions, and clearly explaining that the fact that we are defending the energy and climate package does not mean that we are naive.
In other words, Mr Cohn-Bendit, as we want to achieve planetary balance, I would not like us to be accused of promoting relocations.
It is not about respecting the environment and accepting relocations; it is about respecting the environment and rejecting relocations.
Any other way of thinking is suicidal.
If you ask the Member States to choose between the environment and growth, you will place us all at an impasse.
Sustainable development and respect for the environment are factors in economic growth.
This is why, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will not resent my preferring Mr Schulz's or Mr Daul's analysis to yours, just this once.
Now, Mr Schulz, let us come to what you identified as a point of disagreement.
Allow me to say that I do not think so.
I would also like to say to you that Europe is not responsible for the fact that our German friends have not managed to reach an agreement on a minimum wage, but rather it is the German political debate that has caused you to reject a minimum wage.
Do not saddle Europe with the responsibility for a social failing that is down to national political debate!
In this case, as President-in-Office of the Council, it is not for me to pass judgment.
I would quite simply say, 'Do not ask us, Mr Schulz, to resolve problems that you Germans have not been able to resolve between you.'
I would like to add that in France, in terms of social matters, we attach a great deal of importance to the minimum wage.
What would social harmonisation mean?
You Germans have rejected a minimum wage.
We French want to keep our minimum wage.
Social harmonisation would therefore mean that we would have to reject our minimum wage because the Germans do not have one.
I reject this social regression, including in the name of my European ideal.
Thank you, Mr Schulz, for allowing me to clarify my social commitments.
I would like to add, however, Mr Schulz, that you are entirely right about raising the moral standards of financial capitalism, the rules that apply to credit rating agencies and the entirely reprehensible conduct of some of our financial establishments, and I would like to say something else: in all of our countries there have been directors of large banks who liked to lecture politicians about the rigour with which affairs of state should be conducted.
Having seen what has happened in a number of large private banks, I would say that those who gave lectures were very poorly placed to give them, and that they should now prepare themselves to receive them.
I would like to add, Mr Schulz - I say this under the watchful eye of Mr Watson - that I am against protectionism.
I am in favour of freedom, but we can no longer continue in a world in which there are no rules, in which credit rating agencies do whatever they like, in which a number of financial establishments want to make billions of euros in a few seconds by speculating on the trading floors.
The Europe that we want, and, Mr Schulz, the French Presidency will make proposals on this subject, proposals for regulations to raise the moral standards of financial capitalism, because we can see now that the reasons that global growth has halted for a year is because of the sub-prime crisis and the crisis of confidence in the financial institutions, which have done whatever they like, whenever they like, lending money to anyone under any conditions.
If Europe has any sense, it needs to restore some order to what has become the law of anything goes.
I would like to say to Mr Schulz that I entirely agree with him.
Regarding the European immigration pact, I would like to say to Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit that the French Presidency will involve the European Parliament.
This is the best way to avoid excesses.
You talked about the excesses, Mr Schulz, that are the practice in one country - it is not my place to mention it - but if we all agree on a minimum corpus for the cost, those excesses that you pointed out will no longer take place, and, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am sure that Mr Daul would agree, why would the European Parliament not be involved in this?
I am not sure that it would be institutionally possible.
(Off-microphone intervention from Mr Cohn-Bendit)
Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am aware of your generosity.
In general you are always ready to give advice, especially to me.
Even if I suffered from such modesty as yours, I would not need this advice.
I knew that unanimity was required, but irrespective of that there is no need for unanimity in order for me to say to the European Parliament that the question of immigration is sufficiently important for it to be discussed politically, for you to be involved in it, even before there is a Lisbon Treaty or any modification of it.
It is a political commitment that I am making and I will come with Bernard Kouchner and Brice Hortefeux to present the pact to you, to discuss it with you.
We will consider with the President of Parliament and perhaps the Conference of Presidents the conditions under which you would like us to put this in place.
Mr Watson, difficulties provide an opportunity.
Obviously, when one chooses to be the President of a country and has the responsibility of the Presidency of the Union for six months, if one does not like problems or difficulties it is better not to be European and not to be involved in politics.
Personally I think that these difficulties are an opportunity.
Can you see why?
It is because they are an opportunity for us to move beyond our national selfishness and our partisan prejudices.
Allow me to say that, if everything were going well, my appearance before the European Parliament would not necessarily have gone better, because a year from the elections, when you have the wind behind you and everything is going well, everyone is thinking of their partisan or national interests.
As I believe that here, in the main, the vast majority of MEPs are Europeans, they are aware of the gravity of the situation.
Everyone has to make an effort.
I am not sure whether, Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit, you would have been as open towards the French Presidency if things had been easier.
Personally I think that these difficulties can be an opportunity.
There is one point, Mr Watson, on which I clearly made an error.
I should have talked at more length about the European energy policy.
There are a number of you here who wear particular T-shirts because you are against a type of power.
I respect you.
Others have made other choices.
However, there is a point that could unite all of us, which is that we need a European energy policy, with transparency on stocks and pooling of resources on solar power, photovoltaic power, biomass power and hydraulic power.
Forgive me for not having said it during my initial speech, but defining an energy policy - notwithstanding our differences on nuclear power, notwithstanding those differences - will be a priority for the French Presidency.
I do not think that President Barroso will mind me saying this, as it is also his priority.
This is something on which we cannot waste any time.
I would also like to say to Mr Watson that I am not protectionist.
I never have been and I never will be.
However, the Liberals also need to think about something: we are opening up our borders and we have benefited from it.
However, at the same time the others cannot ask us to do here what they do not agree to us doing there.
China, India, Brazil, Mexico - the big emerging countries - cannot say, 'Open up your borders, reduce your subsidies, but here we will do what we want.'
That is not free trade, and that is not a service to give them.
Just as loving your country is not nationalism, wanting reciprocity and protection is not protectionism.
It is possible to be in favour of free trade and to want to establish a balance in that free trade.
Mr Watson, we will have more to discuss.
Some place an emphasis on protection, others on freedom.
Perhaps we can meet halfway.
Finally, allow me to congratulate you, Mr Watson.
I think that in terms of songs we have the same taste.
(Laughter)
I will pass on your appreciation to the person concerned, and I am sure that she will sign her latest CD for you, Mr Watson.
No hard feelings.
(Laughter)
Mr Cohn-Bendit, I have already answered many of your questions.
I would like to discuss two subjects.
The first one is the issue of students, which is an extremely important matter.
Of course Europe needs to open up to training the elites of the whole world.
I have even thought for some time that opening up to training the elites of the whole world means welcoming them into our universities and, at the same time, giving them the opportunity of initial professional experience.
I am particularly thinking about doctors.
However, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we need to be careful not to plunder the elites of the developing world.
In France there are, and you should think about this, more Beninese doctors practising than there are in Benin itself.
I think that Benin needs its elites.
It is not refusing immigration to refuse to plunder the elites of the developing world.
We will not exhaust this debate in a few minutes.
I am grateful to you for the way in which you mentioned it, but you must understand that it deserves an in-depth debate and not caricatures.
It is not a case of generous people on the one hand and heartless people on the other.
There are statesmen and women who are going to try to find the best solution.
If you will permit me, I would like to say one thing about the issue of China, which is an extremely serious and extremely difficult issue.
I would like to say, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that like everyone here, I heard the emotion in your voice, which is a credit to you, and I would like to say that I share your feelings.
I would also like to say to Mr Watson, who asked me to be a team player, that this is exactly what I have done, because as President-in-Office of the Council, I spoke to all the Member States to find out what they thought and whether any of them were opposed to my taking part - I will speak in a moment about the substance;
I am speaking first about the form. I would like to say that I received agreement from all the Member States to attend the Olympic opening ceremony.
As you know it is a difficult subject, which I think we need to tackle very carefully, as we cannot afford to get it wrong.
However, Mr Watson told me to be 'a team player'.
I want you to know that I discussed this with all the Member States.
None of them were opposed to my taking part, and currently thirteen of them will be represented at the opening ceremony.
This is not a reason, Mr Watson, it is simply a response to the issue of being a team player.
Now, if you will, let us get to the heart of the matter.
I understand those who say that Europeans should not attend the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing.
Everyone has the right to have a view on the best way of defending human rights, and I have to respect those who say that we should boycott the ceremony.
However, my personal opinion is - and I think that this opinion should be respected, because it is respectable - that it is not by humiliating China that we will make progress on the issue of human rights, but through a frank and direct dialogue.
I would even like to say this: I do not think that we can boycott a quarter of humanity.
I do not think this is an intelligent or responsible choice for someone who has the responsibility of being the President-in-Office of the Council to say to a quarter of humanity, 'We will not come; we are humiliating you in the eyes of the whole world.'
I want to go there and I want to talk.
Regarding the core issue of defending human rights, we are in agreement.
Regarding the way in which to defend those human rights, acknowledge that there can be a debate and that the debate will not end with the issue of the Olympic Games.
I therefore want to go there, talk about human rights and defend them.
I am even going to go further than that, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
There are things that I will not say to China, because China should be respected; but there are things that China should not say to the European countries, particularly not to France, because France and the European countries should be respected just as China should be.
It is not up to China to fix my schedule and appointments.
In the same way, it is not up to me to fix the schedule and meetings of the Chinese President.
I will therefore defend the issue of human rights, and, at the same time, as a head of state, I have to consider something.
We always talk about agreements.
I would like to challenge this, as for a democratically elected head of state it is not illegitimate to defend the economic interests and jobs of his fellow citizens.
I want to talk about something else.
China is a permanent member of the Security Council.
We need China in order to put an end to the scandal in Darfur, because China is influential in Sudan.
We need China in order to isolate Iran, so that neither Iran nor anyone that dares to say that they are going to wipe Israel off the map has access to a nuclear bomb.
How can we say to China, 'Help us to establish peace in the world, to ensure stability in the world', and at the same time boycott the country at a time when it is hosting a fundamental event for 1.3 billion inhabitants?
That would not be reasonable, it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self-respecting statesman.
(Applause)
Having expressed my respect for the opinions and feelings of Mr Cohn-Bendit, and of everyone in this House who thinks the same way, I would finally like to add this: respect those who, like us, think as I do.
Before going, I questioned Mr Watson and Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group, and I think that I can say on his behalf that he is entirely in agreement with the need not to boycott China.
He is a socialist, I am not.
I questioned Mr Daul, who is entirely in agreement with this.
I would like to say one last thing.
Look at what China did in terms of being pragmatic regarding the issue of Hong Kong.
Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that it was a very difficult matter.
Fifteen years ago, there were demonstrations in Hong Kong.
China was able to be pragmatic in resolving the issue of Hong Kong.
Look at Macao.
China has been able, through dialogue, to resolve the issue of Macao.
I am even going to go further.
Look at the issue of Taiwan today, where the progress made by President Hu Jintao on Taiwan is remarkable.
Five years ago, everyone thought it inevitable that there would be a confrontation between Taiwan and China, which is not the case.
Will we move China forward through frank, courageous, direct dialogue, or through humiliation?
I have chosen dialogue, frankness and courage.
(Applause)
Mr President, just one minute, out of courtesy to Mr Wurtz.
First of all, I would like to say to him that he can be reassured that I am not insulting the unions, but I thank him for pointing out that France can be changed, as is currently happening, without paralysing it.
It is an insult to the unions to think that their only use is to paralyse.
The unions have a role of social democracy, just as political leaders do.
No more and no less.
However, what I meant to say is that no one has the right to take users hostage.
I am sure that a man as courteous as you, Mr Wurtz, who has never blocked anything, can understand what I am saying.
For the rest, Mr Wurtz, we do not agree, but that does not prevent me from greatly appreciating the way in which you express your disagreement.
Mr de Villiers, I would like to say that I understand your discourse even more given that you indisputably represent a significant political tendency in our country, but also in Europe.
I will even say better than this, Mr de Villiers.
Personally I do not take your discourse as a discourse against Europe but as a call to build Europe in a different way.
Mr de Villiers, I do not want to pit the 'yes' camp against the 'no' camp.
I simply want to try to integrate everyone into a different Europe, based around democracy, peace and growth.
I noted your reservations, I am aware of them and I will try to respond to them, not with words but with facts.
As for you, Mr Le Pen, as I was listening to you I was saying to myself that for years France had the great misfortune of having the most powerful extreme right wing in Europe.
Listening to you, Mr Le Pen, I am very glad that this has come to an end.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I welcome the President-in-Office of the Council.
Firstly, may I thank you, Sir, on behalf of the British Conservative delegation for your hospitality last week and say how much we look forward to working with you to ensure a successful presidency.
We are confident of your energy and your commitment and, having read a very good book recently, we are confident of your vision.
I refer, of course, to your own book Témoignage.
For those colleagues who have not yet had the benefit of reading this remarkable work, may I suggest that you do so and, in particular, I recommend that you open the book on page 146.
There you describe the follies of the 35-hour week and you describe the benefits: to use the UMP slogan, 'travailler plus pour gagner plus'.
You go on to say: 'Rather than the uniform and rigid policy of the 35 hours and the guillotine of retirement at 60, I think our fellow citizens expect a policy of free choice which permits those that wish to earn more to work more and for everyone to regulate their own working hours according to their lifestyle.'
President-in-Office, you have got it in one!
That is the true social Europe.
It is not for governments to force people to work more or compel them to work less, but it is for governments to enable people to work more if people choose to work more.
Your party is about freedom; your party is about choice, and that is what the British Conservative Party is about as well.
So, if these principles guide your presidency, we shall be alongside you all the way.
When the Working Time Directive is revised, we shall be on the side of freedom and choice; when the Temporary Workers Directive is reviewed, we shall, again, be on the side of freedom and choice.
Finally, President-in-Office, let me say that our parties should not just be about enabling free choice; they are also about respecting the people's choice once the people have freely chosen.
Therefore, I urge you to respect the choice of the people of Ireland in their recent referendum.
I urge you to regard their decision not as a problem to be addressed but as an opportunity to be grasped - an opportunity for Europe to reconnect with its people.
This will, of course, take much work with you and your colleagues on the Council.
But as you yourself have said: travailler plus pour gagner plus.
(FR) Mr President, I am a French and European socialist.
This means that in Paris, I am not one of your supporters, but in Strasbourg, I am not entirely one of your opponents, especially when I see you surrounded by two social democrats.
Even if my President is in the wrong in my country, he is still my President.
I therefore wish the French Presidency, and therefore the European Presidency, success.
Since the start I have relaxed while observing you, because I understand your desire to be in the French Parliament.
What I am seeing is a head of state, certainly, but also a somewhat frank Prime Minister.
Regarding the social chapter and your priorities, I think that a distinction needs to be made.
There are indeed matters that need to remain national.
I am thinking about pensions.
However, for everything that affects employment, such as a single market, a single currency and free movement, we need to aim at harmonising towards the best that we have.
A distinction therefore needs to be made.
I would like to add that, in this chapter, I would have liked you to put considerable effort into establishing a framework directive for public services.
You did it for restaurateurs, and it needs to be done for public services.
Finally, I do not think that the European crisis is only social and democratic.
I think that it is also an identity crisis.
From the point when peace was obtained, freedom won and democracy established, the world as it is has made it difficult for many of our citizens to see and understand the meaning of the history of the Union.
That is why matters such as culture, education, the mobility of artists, young people, students and twinning, all of those things are fundamental, because European consciousness can no longer be taken for granted.
It will build itself up, and I think that these subjects need to pervade the French Presidency.
Finally, obviously we are going to judge you on six months.
For a French person that is fine, because in France that is a long time, as you know.
So in December we will have the results.
What is certain is that the Treaty will definitely not have been ratified.
You wanted a simplified treaty, and you have a complicated situation, so get yourself out of it!
I would like to conclude with a phrase that I have borrowed from a Polish writer, which says this Mr President, if you will allow me, 'Being French means taking into consideration something other than France.'
That is the reputation we have, and perhaps you have too a little bit, Mr President.
Mr President, I would like to sincerely apologise to Cristiana Muscardini because I got so carried away by my enthusiasm that Mr Poignant so kindly highlighted that I forgot to respond to you and say how much we will need your group.
I am aware of who is part of it, and I know that you are among those who love Europe, and that there are MEPs who equally love their nations.
Mrs Muscardini, you can be sure that I will take your remarks fully into consideration, and that during the next six months I will try, along with the European institutions, to build a Europe that responds to your concerns.
So, you are the one who has shown - proving Mr Poignant right - that I am forgetful of how overrated my reputation is.
(FR) Mr President, a few weeks ago Ireland said 'no', and I think that, as we all know, this illustrates the increasing split between European citizens.
This 'no' should obviously not be underestimated, and I think that, on the contrary, it should force all political leaders to take into account the expectations and concerns of the people and try to provide answers to them, whatever treaty is in force.
It is not the case that if we had the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow everything would disappear with a wave of a magic wand.
The French Presidency has chosen to focus on four areas, which is obviously very helpful, especially regarding climate change.
However, during this time of deep crisis, a financial and food crisis, an explosion in the price of raw materials, and increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive oil, I think that what the people are expecting is not only a matter of issues, but also a matter of vision; what the people are expecting is a matter of prospects.
Right now I would like to suggest three avenues for reflection.
The first concerns the fundamental, essential issue of our identity.
I believe, I have a deep conviction, that there is a European model, that there is a European blueprint for society.
This European model is economic, sustainable and also social.
This European model, for example, seeks to combat the growing inequalities.
There is, therefore, a European model, and we should be proud of it, we should assert it, carry it, take it up, defend it and protect it.
That is the first avenue.
Then there is a second avenue for reflection.
I think that we need a new vision for the organisation of the world.
In saying that, I am thinking particularly of Africa.
I am thinking of the issue of agricultural products; I think we should stop subsidising exports of our agricultural products and instead work towards Africa being self-sufficient in terms of food and energy.
This is the new revolution that we need in order to have a fairer world in the future.
(Applause)
Finally, I believe, and we should never stop reminding ourselves of this, that there are European values that we should never renounce: they are called democracy and human rights, and they are valid for us in Europe, and will be valid in the future of the Union for the Mediterranean, where it will not be about doing business above all while neglecting human rights.
The issue of human rights is essential for the coming decades; it is the deep-seated identity of Europe and deserves to be defended.
Mr President, these are some of the questions that I feel are before us; they concern fundamental matters, in other words, the vision and the deeper meaning that we must and want to give to Europe.
These questions are not only a matter of politics, but also a matter of conscience.
Mr President, I would like to welcome President Sarkozy again to Strasbourg and to congratulate him on engaging with Parliament, for being real with regard to ideas, even though he knew there would not be general agreement across the House with regard to those ideas.
For too long we have been hoisted with the petard of failed ideologies of the past, the failure to look to the new frontiers which come before us and to meet those challenges head on.
We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post-fascist commands or even, dare I say it, new 20th-century thinking with regard to human life and human rights.
Because the complexity of the world today is very different and far more varied than what can be offered by any one single ideology or any one single plan.
And rightly you mention the importance of engaging with other governments around the world: with China to solve the problem of Chad and of Sudan, ensuring that the problems with regard to Africa and the developing world are met head on.
We are already commemorating today the lives of seven peacekeepers in Sudan who have lost their lives under a United Nations mandate, simply because of a failure of governments to intervene properly and put pressure on the authorities in Chad and in Sudan to protect the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.
It is all very well to speak woolly words here in Parliament about the importance of immigration and allowing the free movement of people.
It is better if we allow people to stay at home.
I come from Ireland, a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years.
None of them wanted to leave Ireland.
They were forced to leave Ireland.
If we give people the opportunity to remain in their own countries, give them support through the mechanisms of the policies that we set up, whether in trade or other areas, then we can do it.
Finally, Mr President-in-Office, you spoke earlier about how you felt the legitimacy of your position in bringing the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the parliament was the only way to do it.
I agree with you.
That is right for France.
But equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected.
It is not an either/or.
There are problems and difficulties with regard to the result in Ireland, but that is not just a problem with regard to Ireland's relationship with Europe.
It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe.
(FR) Mr President, right now I would like to ask you about the position of the French Presidency regarding linguistic diversity.
Diversity is a founding principle of Europe.
All the languages in the world are part of humanity's heritage, and it is the duty of public institutions to take action to protect them.
(ES) Mr President, the Council conclusions of 22 May on multilingualism invited the Commission to draw up a detailed framework on this subject, which it has announced that it will do by the autumn.
What will the position and actions of the French Presidency be regarding the multilingualism policy?
What is the Presidency's position going to be and what role does it intend to give to the non official EU languages, which are also called 'regional' and 'minority' languages?
Because, Mr President, as we await the vote in the French Senate next week, France is currently a very bad example to all those of us who believe that linguistic diversity is a common heritage of all Europeans.
(The speaker continued his speech in Basque)
Mr President, I should like to reply to Mr Sarkozy.
You are a very good orator, Mr Sarkozy, but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener.
This presidency programme that you have unveiled this morning shows that you want a European Union that controls literally every single aspect of our lives, everything from a common immigration policy through to how we run our hospitals and our football clubs.
I also took it from your comments that you want us to be very isolated from the rest of the world, that if people do not have the same standards as us we are not going to trade with them.
But worst of all, it is the sheer arrogance of saying that you know best when it comes to the European project.
You are showing contempt, not just for the Irish people, but for the very concept of democracy which you say you are a champion of.
You said the Polish President must keep his word, that he must ratify the Treaty because that was his agreement.
Well, the Irish people have spoken.
Will you respect the Irish vote?
Will you keep your side of that bargain which says this Treaty is dead?
I do not think that you get it, do you?
The peoples of Europe do not want deeper political integration.
That is why in France they said 'no', and in Holland they said 'no', and in Ireland they said 'no', and if we had a vote in Britain an overwhelming majority of us would have said 'no'.
What price democracy, Mr Sarkozy? You are going to Dublin on 21 July.
Please do not try to do with them as you did in France and try to bypass a second referendum, try to get them to change the rules and to ratify this Treaty through the back door.
That would be showing utter contempt for democracy.
Please do not do it.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, in order to meet our expectations and those of our fellow citizens, the Council that you preside over and Parliament must demonstrate a clear, understandable and concrete political will.
Your presence at the head of the Council is already a guarantee of determination.
In this respect, we have all seen, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, the quality of preparation for this six-month Presidency, and the extent to which the members of the French Government make themselves available.
The priorities that you have just set out are the right ones to respond to the concerns of EU citizens.
In the same way, the other challenges that you raised, including the economic governance of the euro area in response to the explosion of global prices of raw materials and hydrocarbons, or the creation of an area of stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean Basin, are entirely representative of your commitment to a European Union that is more reactive to problems and more attentive to its population.
In response to public opinion, where there are doubts and people sometimes give in to the temptation to withdraw to national level in order to solve problems, it is more important than ever to point out that our continent has a considerable number of assets and is still one of the rare areas of stability in a world that is increasingly unpredictable.
The European Union should seek to demonstrate that it does not undergo globalisation without protecting its people, and I welcome your commitment to proving that.
Finally, as the Union is going through a significant crisis of confidence, we sincerely want the French Presidency to bring an end to the more than fifteen years of efforts to reform the functioning of the enlarged Europe.
We need the Lisbon Treaty to come into force as soon as possible, which you have strongly affirmed.
We all have confidence in you to negotiate with our Irish friends and to convince the few Member States that are still hesitating to ratify it and to do so once and for all.
Mr President, you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket, and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag.
We interpret this symbolic gesture as proof of your determination to act in the service of the Community, and we thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, may I just address the President-in-Office and say that I am Rasmussen I, not to be confused with Rasmussen II, but I want to assure you of one thing.
You talk wisely about the new Lisbon Treaty, and I say to Mr Farage that he has forgotten the Danish case.
We voted 'no' to Maastricht but we voted 'yes' to the Edinburgh agreement and we would never ever dream of saying that because we voted 'no' in the first instance we will block the rest of Europe.
We would never say that.
Mr Farage is wrong: this is not democracy.
I want just to assure you, Mr President-in-Office, and assure France, that we found the solution for Denmark and we will find a solution for the Irish people.
My second point is this: I have an appeal to you on behalf of the European Social Democratic Party and all my colleagues and leaders and political family.
My appeal is that you should add one more priority to your four priorities.
My priority - and I hope it will be yours, I know it is yours - is about jobs, is about growth, is about sustainability.
You said - and I was so happy to hear you say it - 'We need better regulation of the financial markets'.
I could not agree with you more.
We are just working right now in this very Parliament on getting a report through and I hope - and I appeal to my colleagues in the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups - that we can deliver to the French presidency a wise report on better regulation.
I am talking about transparency.
I am talking about better regulation on fairness, bonuses and stock options and all the rest you talked so wisely about.
I am talking about accountability, responsibility, to ensure that the financial market is a long-term patient financing power to our long-term investment needs for more jobs and better jobs.
Connected to that is another idea for you.
You are right in saying that we are losing growth right now, we are losing jobs right now, especially in the UK, in Spain but also in France.
Why do we not take a new initiative for growth, a new coordinated investment action?
Imagine the following scenario: if we invest just one per cent more together in education, in structure, in all relevant issues, within the next four years we will get at least 10 million jobs in addition to what we now have.
Imagine what we could do together.
You said that sport is more than the market economy.
I would add: I agree, and that goes for the whole of Europe.
Europe is more than the market economy.
It is about jobs and people.
Let us care about them.
I wish the French presidency every success.
(FR) Mr President, you said 'France cannot pass judgment on the Irish "no”'.
(DE) I agree.
The Irish 'no' must be respected.
The Irish people are fully within their rights to vote as they have done.
However, all the other countries in Europe also have the right to proceed along the road to a more democratic, more transparent Europe that is more capable of taking action.
The Treaty of Lisbon is a step in this direction.
Therefore I welcome the fact that ratification is being continued.
However, I also think - and here I do not share your view, I disagree - that it would be good to speak openly about the fact that a multi-speed Europe already exists.
Think of the euro, the Schengen Agreement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and many other areas.
The sensitivities and wishes of the Member States of the EU are reflected in their choice of different speeds for things that they undertake together.
A multi-speed Europe makes it possible for countries that want to do more together to do so, for it is important that we maintain the voluntary principle in Europe.
It is important that the countries who want to do something together do so voluntarily and that all countries have the option of joining in at any time.
No country should be forced into a greater degree of solidarity.
A multi-speed Europe also makes it easier to continue accession negotiations.
I believe it is wrong for Croatia and Turkey to be punished because the majority of Irish people voted no.
Mr President-in-Office, you are quite rightly proud that your country is the home of human rights.
Human rights are timeless; they are universal. The Olympic Games are a sporting event, not a political event.
Therefore, I believe it is wrong for you to want to go to China for the opening ceremony, and I am glad that the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, will not be going to China.
Mr President-in-Office, let me say in closing that you found on your seat a greeting from many of my female fellow Members - a rose and a letter.
The letter asks you to play your part in getting more women to the top of the European Union.
Women are pinning their hopes on you as a 'ladies' man'.
Please allow me to add one more request: as a democratically elected representative, I hope that you will support us in ensuring that this European Parliament is able to take an independent decision about where it is based.
(PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere congratulations on taking over the Presidency of the European Union.
This will not be an easy presidency.
It coincides with a difficult period, but of course I wish you success.
Ireland has rejected the Treaty of Lisbon.
We cannot rule out the possibility that Ireland will change its mind in the future, but it is definitely not acceptable to try to influence the Irish decision by means of threats, just as the French and the Dutch were not threatened when they rejected the Treaty three years ago and set today's problems in motion.
EU countries must not be divided into better and worse.
I therefore thank you for saying today that none of the 27 Member States can be excluded from the European family, as the lady who spoke before me, Mrs Koch-Mehrin, might perhaps have liked to do.
Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the recent opening-up of the job market in France to Poles, among others.
We had waited some time for this to happen - a lot longer than in other countries, but better late than never.
One thing I missed hearing in today's speech was any reference to our largest European neighbour, Ukraine.
I nevertheless hope that the summit planned for 9 September 2008 in Evian will bring us significantly closer to the signing of an association agreement with Ukraine.
After all, just now a clear signal from us is of particular importance to our friends in Ukraine, especially at a time when there are further threats from Russia.
Finally, on behalf of the millions of Europeans who are currently afflicted by ever-increasing costs, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your efforts towards bringing down VAT on fuel.
I would like to hope that during the French Presidency you will succeed in winning other leaders over to this idea, including the Prime Minister of my own country, Poland.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay an explicit compliment to the President-in-Office of the Council.
This is the 29th Presidency of the Council that I have experienced, and I must say without reservation that I have never seen such a convincing presentation of a programme and a European idea as this, and I say that in all honesty.
(Applause)
There has been only one other time that a President-in-Office of the Council was received even more warmly, but that was only at the opening.
By the end, he had delivered nothing on the agenda.
That was the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.
We are sure, President Sarkozy, that you will finish your Council Presidency in six months' time with good results.
The way you have explained everything today - the way you have dealt with points put by our Members, the fact that you have familiarised yourself with the dossiers, and that you are not presenting a 'wish list' but a series of priorities backed up by good reasoning - all this gives me hope that you are indeed capable of carrying out your ambitious programme.
If it is a matter of working with you to bring the climate package to completion, you can count on the support of this Parliament.
However, I fear it is more likely that there will be further problems within the Council, problems with the responsibility of the Council and of the individual Member States: that the quotas envisaged will not be accepted there.
We also agree with you that nuclear energy needs to be represented in this climate package.
Here in this Parliament there is a clear majority in favour of the civil use of nuclear energy.
Do not let those T-shirts confuse you.
When it comes to Germany and France wanting to take over the leadership of the European Union together in matters of content - not for major declarations of a global political nature - then we are on your side.
I must tell you that Mrs Koch-Mehrin was obviously not listening when you explained the reasons behind your position on China.
That was a foreign affairs tutorial for this Parliament, and I can only encourage you to remain as consistent and undeviating as you have been in these matters.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, 10 nations produce 60% of the global carbon dioxide emissions.
These 10 countries include only one European country - Germany.
The 27 EU Member States represent only 14% of global emissions.
The United States, 17%; Brazil, Russia, India and China have cumulative emissions that exceed one third of the global carbon dioxide emissions.
All of this proves that European initiatives to combat climate change will continue to be in vain without comparable efforts from the Americans, the Chinese and the other industrialised nations.
While awaiting such an agreement, Europe must fight against carbon leakage.
Currently no large industrial group is making investments in Europe.
ArcelorMittal is closing in France but investing in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, India and China.
ThyssenKrupp is investing in Brazil; the Austrian Vöest Group is investing in India.
In North Africa 10 factories are currently being built to produce floating glass for the European market.
In the absence of a specific commitment from the other industrial States, Europe must show its determination to defend its industrial fabric, its industrial know-how.
Imposing sacrifices on European citizens will not serve any purpose if the rest of the world does not follow suit.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, like the President of the European Parliament, like many other fellow Members, I am a child of the ruins of the Second World War, and I very much appreciate the dedication that you therefore put in your speech, which flouts scepticism.
I see scepticism as something that belongs to the spirit of Munich, and it is the acid that dissolves the European will.
That is why I very much appreciated the energy that you put into a speech which, as Mrs Lulling just said on television, for example, we found clear, precise, and, I can say without the least affectation, convincing.
The second thing that I would like to say, Mr President, is that of course you are right and this has to be said here.
The fears in Europe and the threats to it were certainly largely during its construction in the 1950s, but while the nature of these fears has changed, there are obviously still a great number of them today.
That is why there needs to be an absolutely determined response.
I am very happy with the priorities: I will say that frankly, because they are real, and in particular the immigration policy which will be conducted by your Minister, Mr Hortefeux, our former fellow Member.
Two years ago I had the honour of representing the European Parliament at the Euro-African Conference in Rabat.
For the first time it brought together the countries that had the same responsibilities, whether as countries of origin, transit, or reception of immigrants, and, as Mr Watson said a moment ago, I think that it is very important, especially - and why not? - through the structure of the Union for the Mediterranean, to have a generous policy of proximity and surveillance.
Finally, one last thing, Mr President, do not forget that the reason that Europe has a unique influence throughout the world is because it is a cradle of culture; because it is culture that cements our differences; because culture is the platform for our political systems, and that is why we are viewed in a completely different way.
Your energy will probably also be needed if there is to be determination in this field of culture too.
(CS) Mr President, I should first of all like to show my appreciation for the fact that France has opened up its labour market to new Member States from 1 July and thus removed one of the last barriers between the old and new Member States.
I only hope that Mrs Merkel will follow this example.
France, the Czech Republic and Sweden have together prepared an 18-month presidency programme and I am pleased that this prioritises the issue of energy, which is absolutely key, and also the issue of reforming the common agricultural policy, because this relates to the financial framework after 2013 and thus to what money is going to be available to us in the future.
I appreciate the fact that France wants to resolve these current issues and problems, because this is what worries and interests people.
On institutional matters, I am speaking not as a member of the PPE, but as a member of the DE, so it is probably no surprise that we shall not be in complete agreement here.
I believe that we cannot stand before the Lisbon Treaty like a rabbit caught in headlights.
It is not the end of the world and we do not wish to create an atmosphere of crisis, so the situation must be resolved calmly, without any political pressure, without any legal tricks and in accordance with our own rules. These rules state that no treaty can enter into force without unanimous agreement and we do not have such agreement at present.
I do not believe that it is impossible to expand further without the Lisbon Treaty. I believe that Croatia at least can be accepted into the European Union without the Lisbon Treaty.
Similarly I do not believe that we have to make a choice between Nice or Lisbon. We certainly have several options and we must be able to look at them soberly and without hysteria and to resolve the situation.
In any case, Mr President, I wish you great success in your leadership of the European Union.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have followed the Union for the Mediterranean initiative, on which next Sunday's summit in Paris will focus and we hope that the initiative is successful.
I would like to clarify a few things, however.
This initiative aims to reinforce the multilateral Euro-Mediterranean dimension.
I believe this is right and that we should go in this direction.
I think that if there is a policy that needs a critical appraisal, however, it is the neighbourhood with the southern countries, because the neighbourhood policy actually brings countries into competition with one another that are very divided.
So we need to work on integration between these countries and between them and Europe, and channel resources into that as well.
I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate - and I am saying this to President Barroso as well - your stopping funding for the Audiovisuel Méditerranée programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument.
You have said that there is a European cultural exception but I would add, Mr President, that there is a Euro-Mediterranean cultural exception.
If you consider the world's top twenty intellectuals, in the top ten you will find many from the Muslim culture and a great many Euro-Mediterranean ones.
So let us help one another to put in place effective policies to change the lives of many people in these countries, especially young people and women, who place hope in Europe.
We do not need good students: we need to change the reality of this relationship and Parliament is very ready to cooperate with your Presidency if you intend to move in that direction.
(ES) Mr President, the priorities of the French EU Presidency are realistic priorities that in my opinion are sufficiently capable of responding to what Mr Durão Barroso, the President of the Commission, was saying, to the criticisms that Europe is impotent and incapable of responding to the daily concerns of our citizens: the constitutional problem, food and energy prices, the Europe of defence, and immigration.
Today, the death of an immigrant in a refrigerated lorry in the Channel Tunnel, or thrown overboard from a patera boat heading for the Canaries - as happened just a few hours ago - is one of the greatest contemporary tragedies.
It is a serious and urgent problem and the European Union needs to come up with an adequate response.
The Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Daul, spoke of the need to mobilise political will and I think that this Presidency has absolutely no shortage of political will.
However, Mr President, political will is necessary, but not sufficient: circumstances also count, and even if they are passing, short-term or temporary, while they exist they affect us and place limitations on us, and I welcome the fact that President Sarkozy said that we need to convert circumstances into opportunities.
I regret the fact that Mr Schulz is not here with us now, because when he talked about sport it brought to mind a particular circumstance.
I would like the yellow jersey to be Spanish once again, as was the case in the first stage of the Tour de France.
You are right, though, President-in-Office, that there does need to be a European dimension to sport, and several MEPs have asked me to pass a request on to you to consider whether it would be appropriate for the French sportsmen and women who are going to take part in the Olympic Games, which we have discussed here today, to wear an EU emblem next to the national flag, so that other Member States can voluntarily join in such an initiative.
President-in-Office, we hope that the French Presidency will be capable of joining forces and forging consensuses so that, as you proposed, the European Union can move forward decisively under your Presidency.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, you wanted to place your Presidency under the aegis of the Europe that protects, and I think that there is indeed a very high expectation among European citizens.
However, this is why there is a contradiction here - and you understood the key message from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - with the fact that the social dimension of European integration has not been given the status of one of the four main priorities of your Presidency.
Indeed, as we have seen in recent referendums, people are questioned regarding the institutions and the treaties, but in fact they respond on the basis of the progress of European integration, and finally on Europe's policies.
I think that the imbalance that has been created in recent years between the progress of economic integration - which has been pursued and this is a good thing - and the stagnation of the social dimension, is also behind this disenchantment among the people of the Union, this disaffection towards the European institutions.
This is why the problem is not saying that Europe should get involved with all social matters, but rather that as soon as there is a single market, including a single employment market, there need to be common rules for combating disparities, which otherwise lead to social dumping, and to ensure that convergence elements are focused upwards, towards the best, rather than dragging social situations downwards.
The Commission has just published a social agenda, but if the Council does not commit to some concrete issues - you talked about a concrete Europe - to strengthen the powers of the European works committees, to protect temporary workers, to improve the Directive on the posting of workers so that - and this needs to be added - there is a Directive on the protection of public services and social services in the general interest, then there will not be a response to this need for protection.
One of your priorities is the Europe of immigration, but the Europe of immigration cannot be reduced to a Europe of expulsions.
This is why we need to add to this a pact for integration, which we talked about with Mr Hortefeux - and a pact for development.
You have just come from the G8;
Europe and some of the Member States, including France, were accused of not fulfilling their commitments in terms of public aid for development.
Ensure that during your Presidency this commitment of moving towards 0.7% of GDP is fulfilled, which will be more effective than the disgraceful 'return directive' in contributing towards managing international immigration more effectively.
(PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I agree with the President-in-Office.
This is a difficult moment for Europe.
Each of us feels this personally, including me.
When I was responsible for the negotiations on my country's accession to the European Union, I did everything I could to make sure that future European cooperation turned out well.
I would also like to emphasise that today, happily, there is no problem with Polish support for the EU and for the Treaty.
A considerable majority in the Polish Parliament voted in favour of the Treaty, and almost 80% of Poles are in favour of EU membership.
I support the assessment by the President-in-Office.
We must act for and on behalf of our citizens.
The priority for us politicians is an energy and climate package, but we must do all we can to ensure that its implementation does not hit Europeans with high prices and loss of competitiveness for our economy.
This package needs to be adopted pretty quickly, but it would be a bad thing if speed came first and deliberation second.
Our package should be the proof of our leadership in the battle against global warming.
I agree that we need this, first in Poznań and later in Copenhagen; but this package will not serve as an example to anyone.
No-one will follow it if the European economy loses out in its implementation.
I am therefore glad that you see these hazards, President-in-Office, and that you believe that the principles of emissions trading - because that is mainly what this is about - will be restructured in good faith.
We do have experience.
The REACH Regulation was amended significantly in Parliament with the involvement of the Council and the Commission, to the benefit of all.
We can go down that same route.
President-in-Office, may I congratulate you on taking up the reins in Europe.
I wish you success in the two most important matters for the next six months: the Treaty, and the energy and climate package.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, you will have to take the bull of doubt regarding Lisbon by the horns;
France already has a great deal of experience in the art of sometimes moving European integration forwards and sometimes moving it backwards.
I ask you to find a solution for the Irish, while respecting the will of the overwhelming majority of Europeans, which also counts.
I would also like to say that, from a social point of view, in the Lisbon Treaty there is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, there is the European social model.
So for example, more than a million signatures have already been collected from disabled Europeans, who represent one in four households and are in favour of the Treaty because it eliminates secular discrimination.
You therefore have support behind you to move forward and to integrate the social model.
Regarding immigration, you addressed the left, but you will also recognise that left-wing governments have had ideas that have enabled you to prepare a less closed and more progressive package, which I think Parliament can improve further, but we need to work relentlessly on this issue.
Also, Mr President - and this is directly connected with immigration - you talked about the CAP, but you did not mention Doha; it is nevertheless important for the united Europe to be able to find a solution and respond to the Millennium Goals, because it is all the same package; it is about exploiting our economic capacity in order to move all of humanity forwards.
(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as Head of the Italian delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am pleased that you have taken over the helm of Europe and I am pleased at what you have said.
You radiate enthusiasm and pride.
You believe in and make people believe in an institution, Europe, which has many problems and really needs wise, enlightened and aware leaders, which is what you have shown yourself to be.
Italy has always enjoyed strong cultural and social ties with France: two countries that have made major sacrifices to found and build Europe, which all its members now have the duty to develop.
Anyone working in this institution knows how many difficulties may be encountered in moving forward with the process of development and integration, because this process has to be built between people of differing histories, cultures, social status and traditions.
The politically opportunistic positions expressed just now by Mr Schulz about the present highly popular Italian Government certainly do not help.
However, it is a process that must be moved forward despite the disappointments that it sometimes involves.
The Lisbon Treaty, an excellent treaty, is on the back burner and it will require a lot of goodwill to bring it back, if we are avoid marginalising those who have not understood it.
However, I do agree with what you said: before any further enlargement, we need to define new rules but without leaving Ireland out on a limb.
The wave of immigration into Europe, especially into certain Member States, and mainly my own country and those in the Mediterranean area, must be regulated and viewed as a common problem rather than a reason to make distinctions or actually exploit the situation by penalising countries that are already making so many sacrifices.
The people of our countries must be safeguarded and integration must be built on a reasonable basis.
President-in-Office, the Italian Government and people are watching your mandate attentively and trustingly, in the certainty that the history and social standing that you represent today will inject hope and development into Europe.
(HU) Three things - as the only speaker from the eastern side of the Berlin Wall.
I am disappointed that equal opportunities were left out of the President's speech.
Fortunately, President-in-Office, we women from the seven political parties have accurately described what we want in a letter: it's the flower, it's our flower for you, dear President.
Firstly, I welcome the efforts of the French Presidency at European level in the interests of social equality between genders, but at the same time it seems contradictory that the local institutions dealing with equal opportunities are being closed down.
Is policy other than what France is applying recommended at European level?
Two: the President has informed French citizens that 350 000 childcare places will be created over the next 5 years.
This is an important measure, since it provides an equal opportunity for men and women in the labour market and an opportunity for them to combine their working and family lives.
Good quality, affordability and accessibility for everyone are essential for this, since it is an instrument for equal opportunities and integration.
On the subject of family life, does he feel that women will be capable of combing their working and family activities if they work 65 hours a week?
Women are more defenceless in the workplace and are generally not members of professional organisations.
Yes, we need a common European immigration policy, but it must discuss the rights and obligations of citizens and immigrants.
Migration policy must be supplemented with the integration policy of the reception nationality.
Thank you very much.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council to say: I was looking forward to your speech today with particular interest.
Your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your Presidency.
The whole world is faced with one of the gravest economic crises in recent decades, but Europe is also facing its own crises.
It is obvious that today the Europe of 27 cannot operate according to the rules of the Europe of 15.
This is the institutional crisis that Europe is going through.
It is also obvious that today some Member States do not want political unification for Europe, and do not want our predecessors' vision to be realised.
This is a crisis of identity.
The institutional crisis will be solved, but how can the identity crisis be solved?
I am afraid there is only one solution: the Member States that want political harmonisation should advance, and the Member States that see Europe only as an economic union should stay behind.
Indeed, I am afraid that if we do not go ahead with this solution, Europe will at some point cease to be a player on the international chessboard.
Crises can lead to great leaps forward, but only if the necessary courage is there.
I believe you have both vision and courage.
Be courageous!
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your basic orientation has my full support.
I believe you are the right President-in-Office at an extremely sensitive time, with the necessary sensitivity to people's concerns and the determination to lead and reconcile.
When you were answering the questions, you did not pass the buck, and you called a spade a spade.
You do not run away, but face up to things.
I should particularly like to emphasise your strong commitment to parliamentary democracy.
This commitment is particularly important in these times because, in several Member States - including my home country, Austria - we have been experiencing the playing off of direct democracy against parliamentary democracy and thus the incapacitation in European matters of parliaments in parliamentary democracies.
Let us stand together for parliamentary democracy and against its incapacitation.
(Applause)
It is also important to me that you have directly addressed the cowardice or, it could be said, the double standards, of many governments and members of governments in relation to their shared European responsibilities, as these double standards are one of the main causes of the lack of trust and mutual finger-pointing to which we must put a stop.
We do not require everyone to be bolder, but we do require everyone to be honest and principled.
I should like to touch on three more issues.
The first is your position on the Treaty.
You are not like a rabbit caught in the headlights, you are not waiting for Ireland, but are continuing the ratification process whilst approaching Ireland.
I firmly believe that we shall come to an arrangement with Ireland only after all the other 26 Member States have ratified the Treaty.
However, we must not leave Croatia out on its own.
I welcome your commitment to opening all the chapters by the end of the year.
We also need a timetable for Macedonia.
I would ask the Council to also take a decision on the Small Business Act at its December Summit, as the main competences lie with the Member States.
We need legal binding and not just another public political statement.
(PL) Mr President, I have some good news from Poland.
Today, Mr President, a debate is being held in the Polish Parliament that will culminate in a resolution urging the Polish President to fulfil his constitutional duty and sign the Treaty of Lisbon.
This is the will of the Polish people, 80% of whom support the European Union and are very happy to be a member.
Show me another state in which support for the EU is so high.
This is a signal that Poland will discharge its obligations with regard to the Treaty.
On another subject: I have a request for you, Mr President.
Could you see your way to putting the situation of children in the European Union on the agenda and appointing an ombudsman, an attorney for children's affairs, on the model of the European Human Rights Ombudsman?
We would like the Council to come to an agreement and accept this institution that Europe is so in need of.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were to summarise this morning's debate, I would say that it is good that France holds the Presidency at this time, and good that you, President Sarkozy, occupy the position of President-in-Office of the Council.
This has been a good day for Europe and for this Parliament, as for the first time in a long time we again have before us somebody who speaks for Europe with passion, not just with good arguments.
Perhaps that is just what we need to win over the Irish and to win back our citizens: passion and good judgement, and good judgement includes Europe confining itself to certain limits.
I should like to give you the 'secret of success': we need not only the Treaty in Ireland, but also a new culture of subsidiarity.
We need boundaries for Europe in relation to the rest of the world, but we also need boundaries within Europe.
A new culture of subsidiarity will bring renewed approval to Europe; I am in total agreement with President Barroso on that.
Good luck, President Sarkozy.
Mr President, I welcome President Sarkozy to the European Parliament.
I certainly appreciated his considered and well-argued contribution.
As an Irish member I will also welcome him when he visits Ireland as President of the EU, as a President who is taking practical steps to improve the lives of citizens.
That was clear from his priorities.
I also appreciate his comments on food security and about finding a balance when imposing regulations and restrictions on our own businesses and farmers.
As he said himself, protecting without protectionism.
I could hear in his presentation and in his voice his commitment to Europe.
I and very many Irish people share that commitment.
He spoke about overcoming our difficulties.
That will take time and a willingness to compromise on all sides.
There can be no deadlines.
As somebody who canvassed for a 'yes' vote, I know he will agree with me when I say that an Irish 'no' is just as legitimate as a French, Dutch or Danish 'no'.
It must be given the same respect, then we can move forward.
We can make progress.
I look forward to that, and I wish him well in his presidency.
(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the French Presidency has just set out its objectives, and I wish it success.
The ultimate objective that is before you is to strengthen the European Union and its power to act.
With this in mind, the non-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty would be a missed opportunity.
Europe needs France, especially at this difficult time; it needs the France that was converted, with you, President Sarkozy, after the French referendum.
It is not Poland, unfortunately, that is taking Europe forward today, but one day it will be, and I believe it will be soon.
I hope for you that the French Presidency, with its policies of European integration, of desired immigration, of enlargement to the Balkans, and not necessarily to Turkey, will give Europeans back their confidence in and their taste for Europe.
Mr President, it took Ireland 700 years to get the British out of the Republic of Ireland and I have to sit here time and again listening to people we threw out telling us what we should be doing in Ireland.
I think it is a little bit too much.
Please let a decision in the Republic of Ireland be made by the people of the Republic of Ireland.
Secondly, I should like to say to the President of the French Republic: if you want to change the people of Ireland's opinion, bring Mr Le Pen with you.
That will be enough to change the opinion of the people of the Republic of Ireland.
I was director of elections for Fine Gael, which is part of the European People's Party, for four European referendums: the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty, and I want to say to you that the Lisbon Treaty was lost for a variety of reasons.
People did not understand it; the Government has been in power since 1994; politicians are appearing at tribunals of enquiry; the main government and opposition parties - the political establishment - wanted it passed.
There were fears concerning defence and conscription, abortion and euthanasia - accompanied by syringes circulated by Members of this House - taxation, jobs, immigration.
Much of this was led by the extremes on the right and on the left.
I would just say this to the President-in-Office.
Please prepare for your visit to Ireland.
If it is important that you help change the situation in Ireland, please come prepared and come prepared to listen.
You will be very welcome, but it is complex and it will take some time to resolve what is a difficult situation.
(FR) Mr President, Europeans are placing a great deal of hope in the French Presidency, and this hope needs to be well managed.
The Presidency needs to avoid fuelling both unrealistic dreams and unreasonable fears, including in the neighbouring and candidate countries.
With regard to the Lisbon Treaty, there is not enough diplomatic encouragement for ratification.
The Presidency needs to help to draw up an exit or safeguarding strategy in case things go wrong.
In order to avoid the worst, we need to show from the outset that we are prepared to face the worst.
I would like to conclude with a few words on the dangerous phenomenon of the re-nationalisation of Europe.
National-populism is the most alarming expression of this phenomenon, and is also behind the propaganda in favour of the Irish 'no', the racist xenophobia in Italy, but also the rhetoric on the national nature of social policies.
Either Europe will be social or it will collapse.
I hope that the French Presidency will be sensitive to this side of things.
I am sorry, but I cannot take any more speakers.
We have already gone well over time.
I am very grateful to President Sarkozy and of course also to President Barroso for giving us their time today.
Therefore I should like to finish by giving the floor first to President Barroso and then to President Sarkozy.
Mr President, I will start by very briefly echoing the congratulations expressed by the vast majority of MEPs who have taken the floor: congratulations on the conviction, enthusiasm, energy and political will that President Sarkozy has expressed here today, which I am sure he and his ministers and colleagues will demonstrate throughout the French Presidency.
I would like to say that this is not at all a surprise to me.
I was entirely convinced that it was very good news that France was to take on the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council during this particularly difficult period.
Of course, President Sarkozy and all of us would have preferred the horizon to be clearer from an institutional point of view, but I think that it is precisely during these difficult times that we can see the political capacity and measure the full importance of a strong political will.
I am in favour of this democratic political debate.
I have said many times that we need to acknowledge politically the differences and multiple points of view that exist, for example here in Parliament.
We need to know how to express these differences because Europe is different from a national political system.
In our democratic national systems, each time that there is a political discussion, even sometimes one that is very polarised, we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the State, while very often in Europe when those of us who are for Europe strongly express these objections, we have to confront those who are against Europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the European project.
(Applause)
This is why we really need to be able to express all these points of view, but while strengthening the pro-Europe camp during this particularly difficult time.
Let us be clear, we have the European elections in June 2009.
If the different European political forces and European institutions do not work hand in hand with a constructive position, we will be giving arguments to those who, at the extremes, want to exploit populism, xenophobia and nationalism by establishing a connection between nationalism and homeland, which is an error.
Moreover, I often quote a great French author, who said that 'Patriotism is love for one's own people; nationalism is hatred of others.'
We can love our homeland and, at the same time, defend our European project with conviction, as President Sarkozy said just now.
I therefore hope that the debate that takes place over the next six months will strengthen the European institutions as well as our project for the Europe of the future.
I am keen to answer a specific question.
It is the only specific question that I was asked, and I will of course leave the rest to President Sarkozy, who is in a much better position than me to deal with them.
This specific question was from Mrs Napolitano regarding the Euromed cultural programme.
I am keen to inform you that the current programme, the Euromed cultural programme, still has an allocation of EUR 15 million for this year.
For 2009-2010 it is true that nothing has been decided yet, but there is a great deal of pressure on external expenditure, and in these cases, what happens, quite frankly, is that the third countries concerned tend to prioritise bilateral cooperation to the detriment of regional budgets.
It is therefore an issue that should be discussed with the Euromed countries.
Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of France's initiative aimed at creating a Union for the Mediterranean - which, for that matter, I supported from the very start - is that it brings a stronger element of regional cooperation.
Sometimes I am asked what the Union for the Mediterranean adds to the Barcelona process.
It is, of course, an element of greater political appropriation, and is also political upgrading, in particular thanks to the biennial summit; but it is also the dimension brought by specific regional projects and, now I also hope, by very specific projects to which we will be able to add a stronger private sector dimension, as we still need more resources.
So this is the specific area in which we are working and, to conclude, I would just like to say: 'Good luck France, and good luck my dear friend President Sarkozy!'.
(Applause)
I would like to thank President Barroso and Vice-President Jacques Barrot for being here for 3 hours without interruption.
Mr President, I would first like to say that I think it is natural, when one has the honour of being the President-in-Office of the Council, to be before Parliament for as many hours as Parliament wishes, not only on the first day of the Presidency, but rather I will say to you, President of the European Parliament, as well as to each of the group chairmen and to the Conference of Presidents, if you want me to come at particular times during the Presidency, I am at Parliament's disposal.
You have to play the game of the European institutions.
The European Parliament is at the heart of parliamentary democracy.
It is not a question of availability; it is a question of priority.
The Presidency needs the European Parliament and is therefore at its disposal.
(Applause)
If the speakers will excuse me, I would like to say a few words to each of them.
First of all I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews that I am among those who think that Europe needs the United Kingdom.
I have never been one of those Europeans or French people who thought that we should be wary of our British friends.
The United Kingdom can bring much more than it believes it can to Europe.
The United Kingdom is the gateway to the Anglo-Saxon world, it represents the leading world language and it is economically dynamic, as has been shown in recent years.
I would like to say to our British Conservative friends, 'believe that Europe needs you, that you have a place there, and that if the British have one foot in and one foot out, Europe will be weakened'.
The United Kingdom is a great nation.
It has nothing to fear from Europe, and Europe has a great deal to expect from the United Kingdom.
To Mr Poignant, who saw deep inside me and therefore understood that I loved politics and that Parliament was a little like my garden, I would like to say that yes, Parliament is the place for democracy, and I do not respect or understand those political leaders who would not be happy to express and defend their ideas in the cradle of parliamentary democracy.
I hope that in your remark there was an element of regret, rather than an excessive view of the harmonisation of the employment market.
The same also applies to Mr Désir; I am entirely with you, I am against complete harmonisation because the people would reject it.
However, having minimum rules in the context of an employment market, in the context of a single economic market, is perfectly natural.
Let us all be aware of the difficulties.
Take Austria, for example, which is led by a socialist Prime Minister and Government; they will tell you that the retirement age is 65, and that the contribution period is 45 years.
You are aware of how many difficulties I encountered in bringing the contribution period to 40 years, and I did not immediately gain the support of the French Socialist Party.
So explain to me how it is, when I encountered so many difficulties in securing a 40-year contribution period in France, I only need to be President of Europe for six months to preferably achieve between the 45 years of contributions in Austria and the 40 years in France.
How can that be done?
It is a long way from the dream to the reality, but this is perhaps the difference between the French Socialist Party and the European Socialist Party.
At times I even feel closer to the European Socialist Party than to the French Socialist Party;
I confess my fault and of course apologise for it.
(Off-microphone intervention from Mr Schulz)
It does not work that way.
It is not up to you to decide who speaks.
Speaking time cannot be split between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council.
President Sarkozy, are you willing to allow a question from Mr Schulz?
If so, I shall give him the floor.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, yes, provided that I do not get caught in the crossfire of an all-German debate.
(DE) Thank you very much, Mr President, you are most kind.
President Sarkozy, it is nice that you want to draw closer to socialism in this way.
Having strongly supported the positions of the German Social Democrats in your speech just now and thus distanced yourself from Chancellor Merkel, I propose that you proceed as follows.
If you feel so comfortable within the European social democratic fold, come first to German social democracy and we shall take you gradually closer to French social democracy and, by the end, you will be a really good comrade.
Mr Schulz, this has less to do with kindness and more to do with observing proper procedure - something we in Europe wish to do, after all.
Mr President, you will notice that I already have a socialist on my right, but there is a space for a socialist on my left.
(Applause)
As you know, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that we are wasting time because I think that democracy at European level can be free of the violence that it sometimes has at national level.
The European level enables everyone to step back a little from the electoral routine, which is brutal, often unfair and always difficult.
Finally, the fact that in a forum such as yours we can talk while smiling and respecting each other is perhaps also something that will encourage people to warm to the European ideal and make it their own.
In any case I do not see this as wasted time, and I would like Mr Poignant and Mr Schulz to be certain of this.
Mrs De Sarnez is quite right.
We need to change our development policy, making food agriculture a priority.
It is entirely essential; the African countries need to have the resources to become self-sufficient in terms of food, and undoubtedly part of the money that we have dedicated to developing large infrastructures needs to be invested in agricultural micro-projects.
This is a point on which I fully share your opinion.
You also called on me to defend a vision of Europe.
I share this ambition.
I hope that you will be generous enough to advise me on the content of that vision.
You are perfectly aware that, again, between the somewhat disembodied big ideal and all of the technical issues of daily life, the problem for each of us is having to constantly decide on what to do about the big ideas that sometimes go far beyond the day-to-day difficulties experienced by our citizens, and what to do about resolving the technical issues that affect their daily lives.
It is not that simple, but I will try my hand at it in any case.
To answer you, Mr Crowley, yes we do need development in order to avoid illegal immigration.
Moreover, everyone is aware that the best response to the immigration issue is development.
There are 475 million young Africans who are under the age of 17, and there are 12 km of the Strait of Gibraltar between Europe and Africa.
Africa's disasters will be Europe's disasters, and there are no barriers or borders that can resist that.
We therefore do indeed need a development policy.
Again it is very difficult to decide between multilateralism and bilateralism.
This is a significant subject and I intend to devote a great deal of attention to it.
Mr Irujo talked about linguistic diversity.
I am entirely in agreement, including - and I understand that you do not like the expression 'regional language' - with regard to official languages.
I am among those, you see, who think that we would be helping all the pro-autonomy or independence movements by giving them the monopoly on defending regional languages, and this would be a very serious error.
I am talking about Corsica, in the French Republic, where there are people who are Corsican, who love Corsica, and who speak Corsican in their villages; but that is no threat to national unity.
Therefore, linguistic diversity is, in my eyes, just as important as cultural diversity, and in any case there will be no cultural diversity if there is only one language.
Mr Farage, I very much liked your speech, but I am going to say one thing to you: the British were quite happy for me to close Sangatte, because it was in fact me who closed Sangatte, and it was you who asked me to.
Even if you are a British person who loves his country, you cannot resolve all its immigration problems, and I have to tell you that France does not intend to be the United Kingdom's border guard.
Allow me to say that it is all very well to say, 'in my country I do not want identity cards and I do not want a common immigration policy', but this does not stop you from being quite happy for foreigners whose papers are not in order to be stopped in France so that you do not have them in the United Kingdom.
Just like France, the United Kingdom cannot manage alone.
I would like to add, Mr Farage, that I respect the Polish, but you were not in my office negotiating the Lisbon Treaty with a number of colleagues.
We were in Brussels, and who was in my office?
Not Prime Minister Tusk, because the Prime Minister at that time was Mr Kaczynski's brother.
There was President Kaczynski and I will say one thing: he is a man that I trust and he is a man that I respect.
However, in Europe, when you sign something, if you start by not respecting it, there is no more Europe, there is nothing at all, there are no negotiations.
When one of us commits his country, in Brussels, he must make a commitment at home as well.
I said that, nothing more, nothing less.
(Applause)
This is completely respectful of the Polish: Mr Farage, I think that I defended Poland.
President Barroso will be able to say this better than anyone.
We need Poland, but we also need to have respect for a man's word when it is given.
Mrs Sudre, thank you for your support.
I entirely agree with your analysis and sincerely thank you for it.
Mr Rasmussen, who I understood was Rasmussen I, and I am just about clear who Rasmussen II is, I would like to say that Denmark is a good example of a country that has been able to move forward, and that enables me to respond to all the speakers on the Irish issue.
Of course we should not force the hands of the Irish and we need to respect them, but we need to have the courage to say to our Irish friends: 'You also need to respect the other countries that have ratified the Treaty.
We are not lecturing you, but consider that others also have an opinion to offer and that at some point we will have to find a common path.
Europe does not want to continue without you, but Europe cannot come to a halt just because of you.'
I say this with all the respect I have for a country that has voted 'no'.
We, the French, have caused you considerable problems and difficulties, but at some point we need to get out of this situation in which everyone is watching each other and waiting for someone else to take the initiative.
The French Presidency, along with the Presidency of the Commission and the Presidency of the European Parliament need to take the initiative.
After that, some will say yes and some will say no.
Personally, I think that there is a solution, but it is certainly not in maintaining the status quo or in saying 'we will wait and let time do the work'.
Personally I think that time works against us, that Europe has been waiting for years and that there is no point in it waiting any longer.
We will find a solution; I am convinced, just as the Danish found one.
Mrs Mehrin, I was very touched by your assessment of me as a 'ladies' man'.
I will leave the content with you; I honestly do not know exactly what it means and I will be careful not to go down that road as I would not like you to misunderstand me.
I know that the multi-speed Europe does exist.
We are not all in the euro, and we are not all in Schengen.
However, ultimately, before we build a multi-speed institutional Europe, I would like us to try to do it all together.
Do not criticise the Presidency for having the ambition to take everyone along because, if before we have even started, Madam, we say, 'In any case, it does not matter, let us leave it', then one day we are negotiating a social exception for the British, the next we are negotiating an institutional exception for the Irish, and the next we will be negotiating an exception for the Polish.
At that point I fear that we will get to a situation in which all the countries will, quite rightly, ask for an exception, and where will the European Union be then?
Where will the project be that the founding fathers baptised?
This is what I am saying.
Perhaps we will have to get to that point, but I would like us to get there after we have tried to take the whole family along together.
I would also like to say to those who are concerned about Croatia that I am of course in favour of us continuing the negotiations, and I think that it would be a serious mistake to close Europe's door to the Balkans, because the Balkans need the peace and democracy that the Union can bring them, but I will not go back to the Lisbon debate.
I would like to say to Mr Bielan that I do not wish to threaten Ireland; besides, I would not be able to do so and it would not even occur to me to do so.
I will go there and listen but, at the same time, everyone needs to understand that in the polls 80% of the people say that they are pro-Europe; we can nevertheless work with them without threatening them.
VAT on fuel is a French proposal; I do not want to impose it on anyone.
I would simply like to draw your attention to the fact that I am convinced that the price of oil is going to continue to rise.
We need to have the courage to say this to our fellow citizens.
There is 3% less oil production each year due to stocks being exhausted, and 2 to 3% more oil consumption, due to the growth of emerging countries.
My thought is simply that VAT is a tax that is proportional to price.
If tomorrow oil is 175 dollars per barrel, will we be able to continue, without saying anything, to collect 20% tax on rocketing oil prices?
This is the question that I want to ask.
Along with the Presidency of the Commission, we will report on this in October.
I will try to push it in the direction of my convictions, and we will see what the result is.
Regarding Ukraine, there will be a summit, and we will move things forward.
We need to encourage Ukraine along the road to democracy and we need to bring it closer to the European Union.
Ukraine is not insignificant, it has 42 million inhabitants.
This is not a small decision.
For now we are at the point of association, but anyone who walks through the streets of Kiev can see that it is a European capital.
Mr Langen, I would like to thank you for your compliments, which really touched me.
I rather liked the reference to Tony Blair.
I do not know if this is the reason that you made the reference, but I think that Tony Blair is one of the statesmen who have done a great deal for Europe, and a great deal for his country, and frankly I do not know if he would mind me saying this, but in many areas I find that he has restored credit and strength to the British political debate and to the European political debate.
I think that in Europe, we need leaders and that in his time Tony Blair was indisputably one of those leaders.
This is going to mark me out as being more towards the left, even though I have observed that compliments are not always forthcoming for Mr Blair from that side of the political spectrum.
Yes, Mr Goebbels, others do need to make an effort, and this is entirely the issue that will be raised in the negotiations on climate change, but Europe needs to set an example.
I am not naïve in saying that.
I think that we have more credibility when we practise what we preach.
Some might say that it is better to wait.
Personally I think that we need to take the risk of acting.
Fundamentally, Mr Goebbels, my political philosophy is that nothing is worse than inaction.
The worst risk is to take no risks.
Mr Cavada, you are quite right, we need to respond to these fears.
Thank you for your support.
Regarding the Union for the Mediterranean, I would like to say that in my mind, following on from President Barroso, there is no criticism of the Barcelona Process.
I would nevertheless like to say one thing.
Barcelona was a very good idea, but there was one problem at the Barcelona Summit.
As far as I remember, there was just one Arab head of state, Prime Minister Abu Mazen.
How do you think we can create a Union for the Mediterranean, bringing the northern and southern shores closer together, if the southern shore does not come?
At the Paris Summit, I believe, although Bernard Kouchner may correct me later, that all of the Arab heads of state will be present.
This may be a minor difference, but to me it is fundamental.
I would also like to say to Mr Zahradil that it is not a question of creating a crisis regarding Lisbon, but we should also not act as if nothing is happening.
We should not dramatise, but at the same time it is nevertheless worrying that the last three referendums in the European Union ended in a no vote, which was certainly for other reasons, but the fact remains that at the very least it is not a particularly encouraging sign.
I will not respond to Mrs Napoletano as President Barroso gave you a good answer.
Mr Sánchez-Neyra, yes there does need to be a European dimension to sport and I think that it could only be beneficial if the statistics for the Olympic Games were counted nation by nation, but if there were a specific column for European medals.
This would be a way of showing that we also exist in the Europe of sport.
Mr Désir, I answered you regarding standards in the labour market.
Regarding social policy, we have a famous debate.
The 35-hour week is not enough to win the elections, or to have a genuine social policy.
I would like to add that the reason why I took so much trouble in overcoming the automatic, rigid code of the 35-hour week in France was precisely in the name of European harmonisation, because no other country had followed you along that path.
None.
Not a single one.
Including the European socialist governments.
Therefore, you see, I am quite happy for us to call for social harmonisation, but I would like to say to our French socialist friends that social harmonisation involves not advocating ideas in France that no one else is advocating in Europe, because that is an exception and our country is suffering as a result.
I would like to thank Mr Buzek for Poland's European commitment.
I have never ever doubted Poland's European commitment.
Poland is one of the six most populated countries in Europe, and this is precisely why I say to President Kaczynski that we need his signature, because Poland is not just any European country.
It is extremely important, it is a symbol, and naturally we need to reduce the institutional crisis solely to the issue of Ireland.
Mr Barón Crespo, Doha, yes I said it to President Barroso, I said it to Gordon Brown, but in short, Doha, but not at any price.
I would like to defend two ideas that are close to my heart.
First of all, I am told that if there is no agreement, there will be no growth.
Excuse me, but there has not been an agreement for seven years, and for six years the world has undergone unprecedented growth.
The WTO agreement is preferable to having no agreement, but it should not be said that without an agreement there can be no growth.
For six years we have had growth.
Secondly, what President Barroso, the Canadian Prime Minister and even Angela Merkel are currently saying is that it is not good enough.
Brazil is not making any effort regarding lowering tariff barriers in the industry; there is no effort on services.
Also, what can be said about the closure of the Chinese market?
There is no French exception from this point of view.
Firstly, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must loyally defend the Union's position.
However, in terms of the Union's position, I have not heard anyone, even the British Government, saying that the agreement should be signed at the current stage of the negotiations.
We are therefore unanimous in Europe, even if it is not for the same reasons, in saying that as things stand, it is not good enough; that Europe has made all the effort and it cannot continue to make efforts if the other big regions of the world are not committed to moving forward.
From this point of view, I think that we are all in agreement.
I would like to say to Mr Zappalà that I thank him for his support for the European immigration policy, and to Mrs Gurmai that I think that equality between men and women is very important, but I do not know whether her remark was addressed to me as well.
In any case, the fact that she is Hungarian is already an undeniable asset.
I would like to say to Mr Varvitsiotis that I am perfectly aware that there is a European identity crisis, and perhaps also that the European Parliament could help all the institutions with this issue.
Why not imagine that there is a real debate, President Pöttering, on what European identity is?
This subject of European identity is a subject for European parliamentary debate, rather than a matter for a head of state or government.
Perhaps the European Parliament could even organise debates on this subject, and in that case we will come and give our opinion.
Personally I think it is more the role of Parliament to define European identity rather than the role of governments, who naturally deal with daily administration in each of their countries.
If there is indeed a place where European identity should be defined, I think, and I hope that President Barroso will agree, it is not in the European Council, or the Commission, but first of all in the European Parliament.
I would like to respond to Mr Karas, who said that I need to demonstrate diplomacy.
Yes, understood, I will try to be diplomatic.
I hope that on his part he was not questioning whether my temperament would prevent me from being diplomatic.
It is not simply a question of being weak yet clever, or being dynamic yet clumsy.
Perhaps it is even possible to be both dynamic and skilful but, in any event, thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate this.
(Loud applause)
Many thanks, President Sarkozy.
I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 29 years, and I cannot remember a time when a President-in-Office of the Council spent three-and-a-half hours in discussion with us and responded to every speech.
We look forward to your next visit.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) I believe that France has taken over the European Union Presidency at a crucial moment, when Europe is in search of adequate answers to the numerous challenges of a strategic nature.
France has the task of ensuring the continuity of the Lisbon Treaty ratification process, of focusing on the energy field and of consolidating the European Union's security and defence policy.
I express my support for these priorities of the French presidency and I hope their implementation will be a success.
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Rapporteur on the Black Sea cooperation, I would like to focus on an important aspect to be promoted in the EU foreign policy.
I welcome the initiative of France to consolidate the European Neighbourhood Policy, but I insist on the fact that its Eastern dimension should receive the same attention and involvement as the Mediterranean dimension.
This objective should apply both to bilateral relations, in the context of negotiations on the EU future contractual relations, and to multilateral relations, within the Black Sea Synergy.
Finally, France will take over the EU presidency during the Year of Intercultural Dialogue and it should successfully continue the actions in this field.
I would first of all like to welcome the European commitment of the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his vision concerning the current challenges facing the Union.
I support the political statement that new institutions based on the Lisbon Treaty are essential, and without them it would be irresponsible to envisage further accessions.
The Europe of results must take into account the expectations of citizens and show itself to be a solution, not a problem.
I support the idea of having a mechanism at the borders that will enable fair and non-distorted competition, taking into account the impact of the environmental measures associated with the issues of energy and climate.
The priority of a European legal immigration policy is also a human, economic and social necessity.
I would like to congratulate Brice Hortefeux on his excellent work on the European immigration pact.
Regarding European defence, the President's bold positions will enable us to move forward on this difficult issue, particularly by involving soldiers from all the populations, and supporting the emergence of a European arms industry.
The President is right to defend the CAP, which has never been more necessary.
Finally, I would like to stress the need for better political dialogue with the ECB, in order to have European economic governance that is in line with current global demands.
Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to offer President Sarkozy my best wishes for his work as he takes charge of the Council's fate for six months.
Unfortunately clouds are gathering over the EU's future: the paradoxical Irish vote (Ireland having become the 'Celtic Tiger' that we know thanks to EU funds), the government crisis in Austria, the statements of the Polish President, are all worrying signs.
We must find the strength and skill to relaunch a European path that must revive the enthusiasm and emotion of citizens, who still perceive the EU as something distant and rather abstruse.
I also take this opportunity to offer a provocation to the President-in-Office: to bring citizens closer to the EU, concrete signals must be sent out.
It would be excellent if the French President could start a serious debate on sorting out the issue of Parliament's two seats: let us concentrate all activities in Brussels and avoid the monthly move to Strasbourg (where the site could be used for other purposes, such as the centre of technological excellence): this 'trip' actually represents a huge and unjustified waste of financial and energy resources.
The French Presidency has set the right priorities, for example the climate, immigration and defence, but I should like to focus on one aspect that receives less attention but is nevertheless extremely important for our young people and the whole sports sector in Europe.
The French Presidency supports the 'six-plus-five' rule in sport: a restriction on the number of foreign players.
The objectives are good: obliging clubs to invest more in their own youth training and thus also going some way towards restoring the competitive balance.
This Parliament agrees with this one hundred per cent.
Hence our support for the 'home-grown' rule, which - albeit more modestly - has the same objectives in mind.
The question is whether the six-plus-five rule is feasible at European level.
It conflicts with the free movement of workers and can only be applied if a derogation is made from the EU Treaty, and we are a long way from this course of action.
It is doubtful whether the Court of Justice would ever accept such a thing, even in the light of the new article on sport in the Treaty of Lisbon.
We in Parliament want to join in the search for a solution that benefits European football.
We are simply calling for a solid solution, one that does not plunge football into chaos.
Nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2.
President Sarkozy spent roughly a third of his speech defending the Lisbon Treaty and on continuing pressurisation and blackmail of Ireland, forgetting what the very rules of the European Union say on the entry into force of a new Treaty - ratification by all Member States.
Well, if a majority of the Irish people rejected it then the Treaty is dead in the water.
Ratifications should not continue.
Insisting on ratification of the Treaty is an anti-democratic attitude.
Another priority is deepening immigration policy, where the return directive, otherwise known as the shameful directive, stands out due to its disregard of fundamental human rights and its treatment of illegal immigrants as criminals and not as people who have fled hunger in their countries, looking for a better future for themselves and their families.
The social area was totally overlooked.
He is aware of the opposition that exists to the proposal to amend the working time directive and the proposals that the Council approved and sent to the European Parliament, aimed at weakening labour rights, opening the door to a longer average working week of up to 60 or 65 hours, deregulation of employment and lower wages.
in writing. - (PL) I would like to express the hope that the six months of the French Presidency will be marked by fruitful, effective work for the good of all citizens of a united Europe.
I should like at this juncture to stress the considerable significance of agriculture for the European Community.
In Poland, for example, in 2005 over 17% of employed people were working in agriculture.
The agricultural issue is of indirect importance to Member States - here I am chiefly thinking of the problem of food security in the context of rising food product prices on the world markets.
I hope that the French Presidency will bring a solution to several disputed questions relating to the European agricultural model.
Europe does not have such a good climate or agrarian conditions to be able to give up support for its farmers altogether.
The cost of producing meat, milk or cereals will always be higher on our continent than in South America, the United States or Australia.
We need to bear in mind that these countries too support their farmers.
My view is that higher agricultural product prices are creating a development opportunity for European agriculture.
There is a danger, though, that the additional income will be intercepted by intermediate agencies; in other words, a rise in food prices causes a disproportionate rise in the cost of the agricultural production method.
The result is that the surplus income is absorbed by intermediate agencies.
Agriculture continues to be an important economic sector.
The conditions under which it currently functions have changed, but the main priorities - ensuring a decent level of income for farmers and food security - are still there.
After Sarkozy pulled the wool over his people's eyes, stating that he would respect the will expressed in the referendum carried out in 2005 - which rejected the 'European Constitution'-, at the same time as pushing ahead with the 'mini-Treaty', which basically rehashed the content of the rejected Treaty, presenting it in another form and avoiding a further referendum, he now finds himself in charge of the process kick-started by Angela Merkel, that is to say, to attempt once more to impose the federalist, neoliberal, militarist Treaty that has already been rejected three times.
Given the deepening crisis of capitalism, big business and the EU's major powers, especially France and Germany, are showing the 'way out' by forging ahead with federalist, neoliberal and militarist policies and this draft Treaty, seeking to consolidate the foundations of a 'super-State' to reinforce imperialist intervention mechanisms working in close collaboration with the USA and NATO.
To do so, pressure and blackmail are being piled on (enlargement, the two-speed EU, etc.).
Deaf, dumb and blind to the will expressed by the Irish people, the EU is conspiring for the latter to hold another referendum in 2009 even before the EP elections.
in writing. - (HU) One of the most important tasks of the French Presidency will be coordinating the climate change obligations of the Member States.
It is very important that we reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at Union level.
This can happen if we take the Kyoto Protocol seriously, and reduce emissions continuously and significantly in comparison with the 1990 base year, in accordance with its provisions.
It would certainly be scandalous if the Member States that did not reduce but rather increased their emissions between 1990 and 2005 now received a reward from the European Union and continued to keep the advantage they have that is contradictory to the Kyoto Protocol.
It would be even more outrageous if the Member States that take the Kyoto Protocol seriously and reduce their emissions honestly - including Hungary - were punished with more restrictions.
I hope that the French Presidency will never accept such mockery of the Kyoto Protocol and negative discrimination against the new Member States, including my homeland.
in writing. - (PL) I would like to thank the French President for a speech that raises many of the EU's fundamental problems.
It is true that we must consider how to get Europe out of its crisis.
It is little consolation that virtually the whole world finds itself in a situation that is close to critical.
This has a significant economic and social dimension.
I am talking about the threat of hunger in many regions of the world, since food prices are rising steeply, about energy security and also about the status of the environment.
The world's financial system is becoming increasingly unstable.
Why am I placing emphasis on this?
Because it is not for us to be self-righteous.
The almost 500 million citizens of the EU currently constitute less than 8% of the world's population, and in 40 years' time this proportion will be barely at the election threshold - 5%.
Our European view must therefore not overlook values of a higher order linked to the maintenance of Euro-Atlantic civilisation.
This also has an ethical dimension.
In each country of the EU, then, we need due care for the family, which, while being a tiny community, is at the same time the cornerstone of the whole European Community.
We should not let this slip from our view.
If we do, we shall lose touch, as we are doing now, by abusing the word 'marriage' in applying it to unions that are not marriage.
It is true that we need new legal frameworks, but they must be ones that people can understand.
EU citizens are the subject of actions taken by Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We are merely carrying out a service.
It is precisely in this light that we view the case of Ireland.
in writing. - (PL) As generally anticipated, one of the priorities of the French Presidency has become the issue of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Unexpectedly for most observers, though, the principal character at the start of the French Presidency is Poland or, to be precise, not so much Poland as the Polish President, Lech Kaczyński.
I do not understand the arguments deployed by the President of Poland in declining to sign the ratification documents for the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Treaty was ratified by the Sejm and by the Senate.
Nothing has happened to delay the appending of the President's signature.
The Treaty has not, for example, been referred to the Constitutional Tribunal.
This looks like disrespect for Parliament and violation of an agreement with the Prime Minister, Donald Tusk.
I agree with the President-in-Office that this matter is not by nature political, but ethical.
Poland negotiated the Treaty, signed it, and under international law is obliged to go through with the ratification process.
I also very much hope that the situation regarding ratification of the Treaty will change soon and that attitudes will be significantly better by the end of the French Presidency than they are at present.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I respect the clear wish of the President-in-Office of the Council Nicholas Sarkozy to adopt an ambitious attitude towards the EU energy and climate package and to achieve a Convention in that regard during the French Presidency.
I hope this says above all that the challenges of climate change are at last at the heart of policy.
I would, however, like to remind the President-in-Office of the Council of the seriousness of the task - emissions trading is a very significant market tool and affects so many people that we cannot afford to aspire to the kind of political timetable which goes on at the expense of the environment and sustainable development.
Otherwise France may end up with egg on its face, something of which it could not be proud.
Last month I held a seminar at which environmental organisations, research bodies and bodies affected by emissions trading were able to express their views on its economic effects.
The message I received was clear: the Commission proposal will result in much higher costs without providing comparable environmental benefit.
I refer to the worrying McKinsey analysis of the matter.
Emissions trading must be improved.
The situation is serious.
We will not be able to use European industry, which has been dealing with its own affairs well, as a guinea pig again unless the system is operated in a slip-shod fashion.
It is better to fail to accomplish than to accomplish failure.
I believe that we can deliver a good result in time, but some vital adjustments are required.
Carbon emissions will not be prevented by pious hopes and promises, unless they become part of the directive itself.
We should remain firm on reducing the obligation but the procedure is very much open to discussion.
In Parliament we have presented a broad front to the way the Commission has approached the alternatives under consideration.
I would ask that you become acquainted with it, President-in-Office.
in writing. - (RO) Mr. President, you have presented an extremely ambitious programme, which I hope will be successfully completed.
The pact on immigration is a necessary priority in order to diminish illegal immigration and build a common policy on legal immigration.
Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize an aspect you should take into consideration before starting the planned actions: the pact should comprise a series of actions taking into account the restrictions on the European labour market, imposed on workers from certain new Member States.
It is not normal for the economic migration from third countries to outmatch the free movement between countries inside the Union.
There are Member States that have transitory provisions in force, regulating access to the labour market for EU workers.
Once the legal immigration policy is enforced, there is a risk of disadvantaging European citizens as compared to third country citizens.
In this respect, I would like to congratulate France, which has taken the first step in this direction on 1 July, when it opened its labour market for the citizens of the countries acceding in 2004.
I hope Romania and Bulgaria shall receive the same treatment as soon as possible and I encourage the other Member States to follow the example of France.
in writing. - France has taken upon itself the mission to lead the European agenda for six months in a difficult context created after Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty.
The programme of the French presidency of the EU is ambitious, but it should also be aware of the expectations of the population.
The latest Eurobarometer poll shows that only 52% of EU citizens consider membership to be a good thing for their country.
There is need of a strategy to make European citizens aware that the common interests are much more important from an economic and political view than the things that differentiate us.
Obviously, the priority of the French presidency is the identification of the method of absorption of the Irish flaw as the European process must go on given that the Treaty of Nice blocks enlargement.
As regards the second priority of the French presidency of the EU - the common agricultural policy and its preparation for future challenges - mention should be made that the maintaining of a single-payment system is applicable in Romania as of 2013.
A beneficiary of the CAP as well, Romania will receive this year EUR 735 million in European direct aid for Romanian farmers.
I will limit myself to two points:
It is absolutely impossible to apply for asylum in 27 countries.
We have the Dublin II regulation, which settles the issue of the responsibility of host countries.
However, it is true that there are still differences between Member States regarding recognising international protection, and that is a real problem.
The second point that I want to cover is the basic problem of humanity in this world.
How can we live all together in a globalised world?
We need to tackle the underlying causes that drive some desperate people to leave their countries and, in my view, the European Immigration Pact does not achieve the right balance between combating traffickers, promoting legal immigration and establishing ambitious co-development policies.
in writing. - (ET) This year is an opportunity for the European Union to look in the mirror and see whether the decisions we made last year have borne fruit.
Last year saw the beginning of the environment and energy action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate warming.
We have discussed a common immigration policy for Europe and a short time ago heard testimony on the huge growth in illegal migration.
We have also tackled issues of protection: joint European forces have been carrying out military operations in the wider world and since 2004 we have created EU battle groups and emergency response units.
The new Presidency in the person of President Nicolas Sarkozy has brought freshness and promise to European policy, has given us the idea of a mini-agreement, and has taken a new approach to the new Member States.
There are many examples of this.
Through his own drive and initiative he will certainly be able to launch or speed up many challenging projects.
Because of this I wish to stress that the country holding the Presidency does not drive European affairs separately, although it does have the right to propose certain items for the order of business.
The fact that the Presidency is not responsible for decisions taken at the European Council table is a fundamental matter for it, and one on which it should focus its Presidency, rather than a party festooned with empty promises.
Above all I hope very much that the French Presidency is able to inspire hope in Europeans for specific projects.
in writing. - Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the last European Summit in Brussels the creation of the Mediterranean Union was discussed - a significant initiative for the whole Mediterranean region and a priority of the French Presidency.
But I truly hope that, when emphasising the Mediterranean Union during this Presidency, the Baltic Sea Region and the Baltic Sea Strategy will not be neglected.
The Baltic Sea has become basically a European Union lake, with eight Member States surrounding it since 2004.
The Baltic Sea Strategy covers the areas of environment, economics, culture and education and security, providing a sustainable plan for the development of this region.
It would give me great pleasure if the French Presidency took time to attend to the issues concerning the Baltic Sea, and the prioritisation of the Mediterranean did not mean grabbing the blanket from the Baltic Sea region.
Bearing in mind the near future Presidency of Sweden, it would be reasonable to start addressing the Baltic Sea Strategy to ensure greater coherence between Presidencies.
in writing. - (RO) In the next six months, the French presidency shall have a great responsibility for the future of the European Union.
The Union needs the Lisbon Treaty.
The existent institutional framework, with the requirement of unanimity for certain decisions, is a heavy one.
Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty increases the degree of democratization, increasing the power of national parliaments and introducing the codecision procedure for most of the fields.
The French presidency should also support the common agricultural policy enabling European farmers to produce more.
Together with all Member States, the French presidency should find solutions to the Union's impasse following the Irish referendum.
The French presidency announced its priorities for the next period: climate change, immigration, the common agricultural policy, the Union's defence and security.
Next autumn, in Copenhagen, the Union shall participate in the conclusion of an international post-Kyoto agreement.
The Union should give an example of action in the fight against climate change and, for this reason, the adoption of the energy and climate change package should be one of the main objectives for the French presidency.
in writing. - Nobody is able to explain the reasons for the outcome of the referendum in Ireland.
A norm becomes a law based on universal approval of the people.
Its sense should correspond to the conviction about the unity of all.
Your fellow countryman, a thinker resting in the Pantheon, Rousseau, wrote that 'any law that the people have not ratified in person is void, it is not a law at all'.
That is why the people should control the governments which pose a danger of usurpation of their rights.
But how are the people supposed to take control by means of an instrument they do not understand, the structure of which is as complicated and unclear as the recent treaty?
I have no doubt that you wish to appear - to paraphrase Dominique de Villepin - in this 'temple' of the European Parliament - as a 'guardian of an ideal and a guardian of a conscience'.
I count, however, that you will be more interested in conveying the information about the platforms of shared realisation of European interests to the public opinions, which, in turn, may allow the media to restrain from your private life in order to focus on your political one.

Situation in the Middle East/Gaza Strip (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East/Gaza Strip.
It is a particular pleasure to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Karel Schwarzenberg, who has to travel on to South Africa today.
Previous Presidencies have arranged for a representative to take the place of their Minister for Foreign Affairs, and so we particularly appreciate your presence here today, Mr Schwarzenberg.
I wish you a very warm welcome!
We are of course also pleased that the competent Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, is present - as she almost always is.
As you know, the Commissioner is also very knowledgeable about the problems of the Middle East conflict and, like Mr Schwarzenberg, she has travelled to the region.
I wish you a very warm welcome too, Commissioner.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the floor in this timely debate on the dramatic situation in the Middle East.
Since the start of Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December, we have witnessed a steep deterioration of the situation on all levels.
The humanitarian consequences of this operation are dramatic for the population in Gaza.
Since the start of the operation, over 900 Palestinians have died, of whom roughly 30% were women and children.
We are profoundly disturbed by the loss of civilian life, and the matter has been repeatedly declared in our presidential statements.
The European Union deplores the ongoing hostilities which have led to such high numbers of civilian casualties, and we want to express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims.
We are particularly concerned by such incidents as the attack on the United Nations school in Jebaliya and the firing on humanitarian convoys leading to the death of humanitarian staff.
Over 4 200 Palestinians have been injured, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
According to the United Nations agency, an estimated 28 000 people have been displaced since the beginning of the hostilities.
A large number of them are seeking refuge in the shelters; the rest of the internally displaced people are staying with relatives.
The greatest humanitarian needs are related to the large number of wounded and the overwhelmed health services, whereas displaced people and host families need specific assistance such as food, shelter, water and non-food items.
Since the water system was badly damaged and needs urgent repair, the Gaza population has hardly any access to safe water.
Therefore, providing drinking water is of the utmost necessity.
There are also extensive food shortages at all levels of the population.
Since 4 November last year, foreign NGOs' personnel have not been allowed access to Gaza to deliver and monitor humanitarian aid properly.
Also, the number of trucks entering Gaza has increased since military operations started.
The current daily average of 55 trucks remains pitifully insufficient compared to a need for at least 300 trucks daily to cover the needs of the 80% of the population which has become aid-dependent.
The European Union has been closely following the tragic events from the outset.
Three days after the operation started, foreign ministers met in an extraordinary session in Paris to discuss the situation.
They agreed on the need for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and immediate humanitarian action in stepping up the peace process.
The summit aimed mainly to assist in ending violence and alleviating the humanitarian crisis.
The presidency led a diplomatic mission in the Middle East.
The EU ministerial troika visited the region on 4-6 January for meetings in Egypt, in Israel, with the Palestinian authority, and in Jordan.
The High Representative also visited Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.
The outlines of a solution to the crisis have started to emerge.
First and foremost, there must be an unconditional halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel and an end to Israeli military action, to enable the sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and the restoration of public services and badly-needed medical treatment.
The six-month ceasefire, which expired on 19 December, was far from perfect.
Israel suffered through periodic rocket fire and the knowledge that its foe was amassing greater firepower.
Gaza endured a really punishing economic blockade, totally undermining its economic development.
In order to achieve a sustainable ceasefire, we have to look for a sensible compromise entailing an end to rocket launches and reopening of the crossings.
A viable solution must address the tunnels across the borders, especially along the Philadelphia route, to prevent the smuggling of weapons.
It must also lead to the systematic and controlled opening of all border crossings to enable the Gaza economy to develop.
We believe that the deployment of international missions to monitor implementation of the ceasefire and to act as a liaison between the two sides could be helpful.
In this regard, the European Union is ready to return its observers to the Rafah crossing and to extend the mandate of the European border mission in scope and content.
We acknowledge that Israel has agreed to a daily lull to allow desperately-needed food, fuel and medicine into Gaza.
However, only a full and immediate ceasefire would allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that Gaza so desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services.
Israel must ensure the unhindered and safe access for humanitarian aid and other essential supplies, including food, medicines and fuel, to the Palestinian civilian population of the Gaza Strip, as well as the safe passage of civilian persons and humanitarian personnel into and from the Gaza Strip.
But even a durable and comprehensive solution in Gaza will not be sufficient to install peace in the region.
We need to address broader and more complicated challenges.
We need a new and inclusive strategy that addresses the internal Palestinian political situation, as well as a resumption of the peace talks which have been suspended due to the Gaza crisis.
Palestinian reconciliation, and a government representative of the aspirations of the Palestinian people, is more necessary than ever.
We therefore support the mediation effort undertaken by Egypt in accordance with the Arab League's resolutions of 26 November 2008.
As pointed out in the conclusions of the GAERC in December 2008, the European Union is prepared to support any stable Palestinian government that pursues policies and measures reflecting the Quartet's principles.
The European Union stresses the need to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and calls for the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the resolving of all outstanding issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including all core issues.
A durable and comprehensive solution will ultimately depend on real progress in the Middle East peace process.
Urgent and great efforts by the parties will be needed to achieve a comprehensive peace, based on the vision of a region where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace, in secure and recognised borders.
The latest outbreak of violence in the Middle East might not only set back prospects of a peaceful settlement in the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
The political damage the fighting is causing, both in terms of regional polarisation and radicalisation, and in the further discrediting of moderate forces, must not be neglected either.
Only a viable Palestinian state will bring security to a region that has suffered for too long.
This is especially in the interests of Israel and its neighbours.
Therefore, urgent measures must immediately be taken to reverse the damage done by the military action in order to restore the possibility of an equitable negotiated outcome.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think we all would have hoped for a better start to 2009.
Unfortunately, we face a terrible and appalling conflict in Gaza, which is now in its third week.
It gives cause for immense concern.
We discussed it yesterday at a meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Development and those Members of the European Parliament who had been in Gaza at the weekend.
The President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned the terrible statistics of the dead and injured, which get worse every day.
There is increasing evidence of victims suffering from extreme burns, and aid agencies report that the population is suffering from acute shortages of food, fuel and medicine, not to mention the destruction of houses and infrastructure.
However, Israel has also suffered losses and has faced hundreds of rockets being fired into its territory by Hamas, targeting Israeli civilians.
War, unfortunately, always produces immense human suffering, and this war is no exception.
Therefore, beyond its immediate devastating impact, it pushes the prospect of peace much further away, undermines the Arab Peace Initiative and could potentially have a very negative impact on the stability of the whole region.
I should like to outline quickly the diplomatic activity that we have taken together to bring this conflict to an end, and then to look at the mid- and long-term challenges.
We have been active from day one, which I think was important.
We know that we are not the main player in the Middle East, but we were, and are, an important player.
Therefore, in response to the outbreak of the crisis, the emergency meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Paris on 30 December 2008 was very important in developing proposals from the outset - the Paris Declaration - for bringing this conflict to an end, which we then used in our delegation and visit to the Middle East.
Here there are three elements.
First and foremost, the Paris Declaration called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, including both an unconditional halt to rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel, but also an end to the Israeli military action.
We called for a ceasefire to be accompanied by a permanent and normal opening of all border crossings, as provided by the agreement on movement and access in 2005.
We expressed willingness to re-dispatch the EU Border Assistance Mission (BAM) to Rafah to enable its reopening, and we also indicated that we were willing to examine the possibility of extending assistance to other crossing points, provided that our security concerns were met.
Second, we stressed the urgent humanitarian needs, which we said had to be met.
Here we urged the immediate opening of the crossing points to enable pressing medical assistance, fuel and food to be delivered to the Gaza Strip, to enable humanitarian workers to gain access and for the injured to be evacuated.
Third, we reiterated our position that there is no military solution to this Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that the peace process is the only way forward and that efforts have to be stepped up as soon as we find a durable ceasefire.
As you have heard, our mission was carried out in tandem with a visit by President Sarkozy, who had planned to make a trip to Syria and Lebanon and who then decided to visit Egypt and Israel to reinforce these efforts, still on the basis of our declaration of 30 December 2008.
France is currently chairing the Security Council, so it was an important initiative.
We coordinated closely, including a joint meeting in Ramallah, where President Sarkozy outlined his ceasefire plan, for which we - the troika - had to some extent paved the way through our discussions with key stakeholders, particularly Egypt and Jerusalem.
These efforts reinforced each other, sending a strong, united message from the European Union, and the troika not only conveyed this EU institutional position but also manifested our presence.
I think it was important that President Sarkozy also went to Syria and then Mr Solana accompanied him to Syria and Lebanon and also consulted with Turkey.
I think all of this was needed.
I particularly stressed the humanitarian situation, as has already been said, and I called particularly for the opening of the crossings and also for the possibility of at least some hours of ceasefire to allow the work of the international organisations to be carried out.
Israel accepted some of these points, and, in the negotiations with the Israeli Government, I also secured the co-location of an ECHO official in the Israeli Defence Force premises to coordinate the channelling of humanitarian aid with the Israeli armed forces, as had been done in the war in Lebanon, and that was a powerful tool for better coordination.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to all the courageous colleagues still working in Gaza, to those from UNWRA and ICRC, with whom we are working and who receive a lot of our funding, but also to many others.
(Applause)
I would also like to offer my sincere condolences to the families of those workers who have already been victims of this tragic episode.
The Commission has been spending quite a lot also on immediate humanitarian funds and we are ready to do more in the future.
What have these negotiations achieved?
As the President-in-Office has said, they contained the major elements for the latest Security Council resolution, which then, a few days after the negotiations, was adopted with the abstention of the Americans.
An immediate ceasefire, Egyptian guarantees to stop smuggling through the tunnels, opening of the crossings for humanitarian aid, including deployment of a force - possibly with international participation and/or the Palestinian Authority's security forces - policing the 15-km-long Philadelphia corridor between Gaza and Egypt.
We understand that the Palestinian Authority has accepted this proposal and now Israel and Hamas are studying it.
We think it is very important that very soon something works.
My latest information is that everybody is working very closely on it and maybe in a few days we will really have such a ceasefire.
I hope that this will be the case.
On mid-term perspectives, sadly both Israel and Hamas have initially rejected this UN Security Council resolution, but from these daily contacts I hope that an agreement can be achieved quite soon.
It is important to say and recognise that Egypt has been playing a leading role in direct contacts with Hamas, and also that in this regard President Sarkozy's visit to Syria, as well as the Turkish efforts, have been very important.
I also understand that the summit of the Arab countries could take place in Qatar at the end of this week.
We aim, as this intense diplomatic activity shows, to support all relevant actors who have the leverage with Hamas to help deliver a sustainable solution as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1860.
As soon as this ceasefire is agreed, we will have to think, probably in the form of a conference, how to formulate more concrete measures to alleviate the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian population in Gaza.
However, we have to be clear in saying that whatever we do, it must not contribute to an endless cycle of destruction and reconstruction with no peace.
Under the right conditions I might come back to you and seek your help to contribute in a meaningful way to constructive efforts, as I have done in the past.
You know that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is touring the region and hopefully he too can contribute to this final success that is absolutely necessary to getting this lasting ceasefire.
As a long-term perspective, we have to say that the current offensive clearly contributes to a weakening of trust between Palestinians and Israelis.
Military operations can never bring a lasting peace; only a negotiated political agreement can do this.
Dialogue should therefore resume both between Israelis and Palestinians and among Palestinians.
Once hostilities have stopped, I think it will be important to resume talks aimed at a comprehensive peace as soon as possible.
Here we have to work with the new US administration to ensure it is able to support bilateral negotiations from the beginning.
In this regard I welcome Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton's commitments at her Senate hearing yesterday.
We will insist that parties negotiate on substance, and not just on process, and that the Anapolis process comes to a successful conclusion.
This crisis shows that a successful conclusion is more urgent than ever.
The question of Palestinian reconciliation will also be central.
It is unlikely that Hamas will be eradicated by this operation.
Possibly it will come out debilitated militarily, but strengthened politically.
Hamas's position that President Abbas's term will end on 9 January is another issue which is closely linked to the reform of the PLO and of Fatah.
To achieve lasting peace it is clear that a strong Palestinian Authority needs to speak for all Palestinians and that it needs to be committed to a two-state solution through peaceful means.
The conflict in Gaza also, unfortunately, has potential negative repercussions in terms of regional support for the peace process.
Israel's image with several pro-peace Arab regimes has been dented by the excessive suffering of the Gaza civilian population.
Israel's leaders and the Israeli population should understand how negative this is for their aspirations as a people to live in peace.
We are their friends and must tell them that we are doing this.
Israel therefore cannot afford to waste any time in reaching peace.
This is my first short, or not so short, analysis, and we will have to try to work in order to get this durable ceasefire in order then to be able to go on and get peace negotiations under way with a new American administration.
Mr President, 17 days of fighting in Gaza have quite simply left a heartbreaking situation.
The worst part, because it is irreparable, is the loss of human life, including innocent civilians and children.
However, we can also see destruction, chaos, hatred and revenge; the Palestinian cause divided; the radicals being strengthened to the detriment of the moderates; and a peace process that has been completely derailed.
As pointed out by the President-in-Office, this is because all the battles in a war may be won, but the most important battle can still be lost, which is the battle for peace.
Mr President, rather than trying to apportion responsibility or blame to either or both sides, the most important issue - as the Commissioner has just said - is to bring about an immediate ceasefire, as called for by UN Resolution 1860.
As the UN Secretary-General has just reminded us, both sides must comply with this resolution.
It is also vital to alleviate the terrible humanitarian and economic situation that exists in the Gaza Strip, which is governed - in inverted commas - by Hamas, an organisation that is on the EU's list of terrorist organisations.
However, we must remember that not only is Hamas one of the causes of the conflict, it is also a consequence of terrible circumstances.
Mr President, my political group supports and wants to recognise the efforts made by all the political groups in this House to support the motion for a resolution that we will adopt tomorrow.
We also want to pay homage to those Members who have attended the negotiations, particularly the representative of my group, Mr Brok, who had a very difficult task.
Mr President, my group supports the efforts of the Commission and the Council to bring about a ceasefire as soon as possible, in collaboration with the Arab countries - Egypt in particular - and the other members of the Quartet.
We are very hopeful about the statement made yesterday to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations by the Secretary of State-designate, Hillary Clinton, as regards offering pragmatic, dialogue-based and effective diplomacy.
Finally, Mr President, I come to the most important element: the European Union is a union of values with, in prime place, the value of peace.
I believe that the European Union must make every effort and use all its political weight in the interests of this cause, without allowing our thoughts to become muddled or our hearts to become hardened to such a conflict.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, debates of the kind we are holding today are very difficult for us all.
The reason they are difficult is that Israel is a friend, that many of us - and this is particularly true of me - feel bound to the country by ties of deep friendship.
With friends it is all the more important to discuss controversial subjects openly.
So far, this conflict has claimed 1 000 lives in 17 days.
It is a bloody conflict, and women and children are suffering particularly as a result of it.
There is a UN resolution that forms a basis for declaring an immediate ceasefire and opening negotiations.
It is crystal clear that the conflict can be resolved only on the basis of international law, and the fact that international law and international humanitarian law must be respected should be obvious to a democratic country based on the rule of law.
It is actually a shame that we are having to discuss this.
Therefore, all we can do to overcome the humanitarian crisis is to appeal for an immediate ceasefire.
What we say in our resolution is not just anything, but something that is vital in order to put a direct and immediate end to the loss of life, the starvation and the misery.
It is quite clear that the State of Israel has a right to defend itself.
It is entitled to defend itself against people whose aim it is to destroy the State.
Yet a democratic country based on the rule of law must always ask itself whether the means it uses to do so are proportionate.
In my estimation - and, I believe, that of most of my fellow Members in this House - the means are not proportionate.
(Applause from the left)
We must tell our friends in Israel, regardless of their political orientation, that we are aware that Hamas is no peace movement.
We know that it is led by people who do not share our fundamental values, and of course each rocket that is fired at Israel is an attack against which the State is entitled to defend itself - but, in spite of everything, it is a mistake to refuse to engage in dialogue.
If dialogue is the fundamental precondition for peaceful development, to refuse to engage in such dialogue is to perpetuate the armed conflict.
A fundamental adjustment is needed, therefore.
There will have to be dialogue with Hamas.
If Israel cannot engage in this directly - I can understand the point of view of Israeli politicians who say we cannot talk to Hamas, even though many of the country's citizens believe they should - if parliamentarians and members of the government say they do not want to, there are enough opportunities for international mediation.
For example, there is the Quartet, and one of the possible tasks of the European Union within the Quartet is to enable such mediation on dialogue.
It is a fundamental error to believe that there can ultimately be a military solution to this Middle East conflict.
I consider this a fundamental error regardless of which side believes it.
There can be no solution via terrorist acts, and there can be no solution via conventional military action.
The only solution there can be is dialogue between the parties to the conflict, with the help of international mediation.
What is needed is an immediate ceasefire.
This must be guaranteed by means of the mechanism provided by the international community, if necessary with the help of a multinational force with participation from Arab and, in particular, Muslim States.
This would be a way to now bring about a ceasefire and an improvement.
When I was a young lad and entering politics, I was told that one does not talk to terrorists.
At that time, the main terrorist was Yasser Arafat.
A couple of years later I saw pictures on television of this terrorist leader receiving the Nobel Peace Prize together with Israeli politicians.
What was possible then can be possible also in future.
Therefore, one question is whether progress is made to the extent that the available mechanisms produce the necessary dialogue.
On behalf of my group, I should like to thank all those, including from other groups, who worked on our resolution.
If this resolution, which is supported by all the groups in the House - I consider this a good sign - can help improve the atmosphere, we shall have made a contribution, however small, to ending loss of life that is intolerable to all.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the day will indeed come when we have to separate the good from the evil, but I think that, today, it is more urgent that we make our demands, which are: an immediate truce, with an end to rockets being launched into Israel and to Israeli operations in Gaza; the delivery of humanitarian aid; a lasting ceasefire, with an end to trafficking in weapons and munitions, with effective surveillance of the border between Egypt and Gaza, with the withdrawal of Israeli troops and with the reopening of the crossing points; and, lastly, the lifting of the embargo - and all of this, at the same time.
This will be a highly complex phase, one that will no doubt or most probably require the presence of an international force, and I believe that the Union should prepare itself to take part in this.
I should like to make two additional points.
In order to succeed, the European Union will have to speak and act clearly and not in a disorganised manner.
It is very useful to have good intentions, but it is more important to be effective.
The United States will also have to make a commitment, as will the Arab League and its member countries.
Lastly I would add that, in order to offer a real alternative to the situation in Gaza, Israel will have to significantly improve the situation in the West Bank: 634 checkpoints, the splitting in two of the road network, 8-metre-high walls, as well as the countless acts of humiliation inflicted on the Palestinians, do not offer an appealing enough alternative to the inhabitants of Gaza to make them turn their backs on Hamas.
To conclude, I would say that the day will inevitably come when everyone will have to speak to everyone else.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like everyone, we are all, obviously, involved in and upset by this situation, but I believe that it is a duty, at least for me, to reject any kind of hypocrisy.
The problem has very remote roots: the legitimate and sacrosanct right of the Palestinians to have a free state is coupled with the equally sacrosanct right of Israel to be recognised, and we know that Israel has been removed from the map in many countries.
We know that France, Italy, Spain and Germany would certainly not have stood for being removed from the map; they would not have agreed to be considered non-existent.
We know that it was not Israel that started this umpteenth war and that terrorism is still one of the main problems.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that, setting aside hypocrisy, we now have a duty to start thinking in different ways.
We cannot believe that dialogue with terrorists is justified by the fact that so many civilians have died, because this would create an excuse for any terrorist in the future to use violence, force and death in order to obtain political legitimacy.
I believe that we, as the European Union, should finally start behaving more consistently and find the ability to tackle the problem of economic relations with countries that do not recognise Israel, and to provide humanitarian corridors that enable civilians, both Palestinian and Israeli, to reach a place of safety.
In this case it is the Palestinians that are suffering more, having said that, Mr President, I believe that it would also be right to review the position on aid that has been given and which is being given now, but over the use of which we have no control.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation is certainly enough to make one weep.
The hope for peace and security for those concerned vanished in the smoke of Gaza and under the bodies of the dead, and of the children, and of the women, and of the men, and of the wounded.
We are further now from a hope of security than we ever have been.
All those who think that this war is, according to the logic of the Israeli argument, a war justified by the fact that there was a rocket attack on Israel, and that the Palestinians should be taught a lesson, have not understood a thing.
They have not understood a thing, for teaching someone a lesson is a dismal way of educating them and one that has never worked.
Since the time of Clausewitz we have known that he who starts a war must know how to finish it, must know what the aim is.
Well, the aim of this war is more security for Israel.
We can say today that the aim of this war will never be achieved by this war and the way in which it is being waged.
The more civilian deaths, the more Palestinian deaths, the less security in the region!
That there is the drama, the tragedy that is currently taking place in that region.
And that is why we have to be very clear here.
Mr Schulz is right: Israel needs to be protected from itself!
Israel needs to be saved from the temptation of a solution that involves war and armed force.
The Palestinians need to be protected from Hamas.
Palestinian civilians need to be protected from Hamas.
That is our task.
It is not easy, but we must be clear.
I call on the Council to stop thinking in terms of upgrading, increasing, improving relations with Israel while the situation remains as it is.
This is a poor solution; this is not the right solution!
(Applause)
I call on all those who rightly advocate a dialogue, a debate with Hamas, not to be naïve, to bear in mind the fact that a debate must be held with Hamas in order to improve the situation in Gaza, since they hold the power, but, at the same time, to realise that Hamas's strategy requires there to be casualties.
Israel has fallen into Hamas's trap: the more deaths there are in Gaza, the better it is for Hamas.
That is one of the truths that Hamas must also be told.
We refuse to accept this suicidal strategy of Hamas's that seeks to create victims and martyrs in order to launch acts of aggression against Israel.
Hamas must be told this, too.
To conclude, I am going to tell you something: the only ones who can resolve the Hamas problem are the Palestinians.
As long as Israel continues to occupy the West Bank, as long as Israel fails to offer a positive solution to the Palestinians of the West Bank, more and more Palestinians will turn to Hamas.
If we give the Palestinians in the West Bank a hope of life, they will rise up against Hamas and they will rid us of Hamas.
Free the Palestinians from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Palestinians will free themselves from Hamas.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Rahed is 50 years old; he has lost his home, his three children, his wife and two sisters-in-law.
Rahed is in despair, and is in the centre that we visited.
He said, in deep distress, 'Hamas will say that it has won when this attack is finished, and Israel will say that it has won, but in reality it is we civilians who are dead.'
I would like to say another thing: in reality, with the dead bodies of women and children that we saw, and with over 4 000 wounded in the hospital without any treatment, what is dying there is justice; what is dying is the dream of a Europe that wants human rights to be universal, and that is a tragedy!
We are ineffectual.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, you know that I have great respect for you, and I know that you are taking action and working together with others to achieve much.
I believe that we must understand, clearly and unambiguously, that this military war, this militarism on the part of Israel, is leading not to Israel's salvation, but to its end, including its moral end.
This is what David Grossmann says, moreover, when he commemorates Mr Rabin, killed by a fundamentalist Jew, not a fundamentalist Islamist, because he wanted to achieve peace.
Bring in a cease-fire!
Bring in a cease-fire!
That is what a Norwegian doctor said to me, who is operating every day and working round the clock (we are sending doctors to Gaza).
A cease-fire is what we want!
The Security Council must start to turn its words into concrete actions.
We agree with diplomacy, but we must use not only diplomacy, we must also use the instruments that we have.
One instrument that we have in relation to Israel is in fact the upgrade, and I am pleased to hear that today, for example, the European Commission's representative in Tel Aviv has said that now is not the time to think about upgrading.
We should take a break from that, because what we must do is to bring about a cease-fire.
This is extremely important.
I think it is important, and that it is a strong message.
You were speaking about protection and international protection.
I believe that it is a mistake to think only about Gaza and Rafah.
Protection for the civilian population comes from the north, it comes from the Israeli attacks that come from Herez.
Border control is control of the main borders, Rafah and Herez, because for a long time, since 1992, since the Oslo agreement, as you very well know, Palestinians have not been able to exit through Herez, and not even sick people get out through there.
We must therefore think not only in terms of the tunnels, and the weapons with which Hamas can arm itself, but in terms of absolutely all the prohibitions that exist for the Palestinians.
We need a cease-fire and an opening-up not only of humanitarian corridors, but an opening up of all the crossing points, because if the people do not have food to eat, if the people do not have trade, what can be done?
Then that will be truly serious pressure for Hamas to stop existing and stop carrying out actions that harm the Israeli population.
Israel, however, should know that it is the West Bank which is militarily occupied and it should truly make peace, and not build settlements.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Mrs Morgantini.
I should like to express my respect to you and the other MEPs who took the initiative to travel to the Gaza Strip in recent days.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Palestine is Islamic territory, inalienably so.
Since its creation in 1987, the Islamic movement Hamas has stuck firmly to this basic principle.
In this, it receives full backing from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This ideological point of view leaves absolutely no room for the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East, and the baneful effects of this Muslim totalitarianism are making themselves cruelly felt in the Gaza Strip.
Typical of Hamas's philosophy is the military use of mosques in Gaza, with all the tragic effects that this entails.
I would in this respect refer you to the lucid report in last Monday's Frankfurter Allgemeine.
If Europe really values the continued existence of the Jewish state of Israel, a confrontation between Hamas and its ally Hezbollah in Iran is on the cards.
Are we prepared to brace ourselves for this grim, albeit realistic, prospect?
After all, a cease-fire or temporary armistice is to Hamas and company a mere pause for breath in the Jihad against Israel.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I believe that the vast majority of this House shares the wishes for peace and the concerns that have so far been expressed by many of us here.
I also believe that what was said by the Council can be endorsed, and I would argue that the Commission has so far pursued a course that may be beneficial to dialogue: the opening up of the humanitarian corridors and the bilateral cease-fire might herald a subsequent commitment to organise an international safety zone.
Here perhaps Mrs Morgantini is right, in asking that this zone should relate not just to Gaza, but should extend to all Palestinian territories.
Basically, I have the impression that the wishes and the diplomatic activity of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to some extent at least, can be seen as adopting the same approach as that which the Pope sought to adopt on this issue.
I humbly wish to share the same kind of approach: after all these years, we must still seek a solution for two peoples and two states - that is a point which we must not forget - and we must seek, finally, to affirm international law.
There is not and never will be a military solution - Mr Schultz said that too, and every now and then I must refer even to him - and I must say that undoubtedly there will never be a military solution that resolves the problem in the Holy Land.
On this point, I believe that the European Union has the tools to support whatever diplomatic effort may be of use here.
I am sure Mr Schulz will be pleased to hear you mention his name in connection with the Holy Father!
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to describe my starting point.
Hamas opposes a two-state solution, rejects the right of existence of the State of Israel, has taken power by means of a brutal coup against its own people, fires rockets at civilians, and uses civilians, schools and mosques as human shields.
How, when trying to protect one's own civilians, is it possible to react proportionately if the other side is using its own civilians as human shields?
Therefore, the concepts of numerical comparison and proportionality are not applicable in a situation such as this.
In a war situation there is no proportionality - each war and each casualty is one too many, and it is not possible to balance figures for each side against the other.
This seems to me to be the sensible starting point.
Therefore, we should not be engaging in the kind of one-sided finger-pointing we have seen, but instead attempting to bring about a ceasefire and to provide help in this regard.
I believe that President-in-Office Schwarzenberg and his delegation, and also Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, with the help of other national delegations, have done more in this regard than any other party, for which I wish to thank them sincerely - I have seen no sign of the United States, hardly any sign of the UN and no sign of the other members of the Quartet.
We must ensure that this ceasefire has two components: there must be an end to the Israeli attack, and Hamas must be prevented from getting its hands on new rockets from Korea and Iran that would put Tel Aviv within range.
For this reason, it must be ensured not only that the firing stops but also, by means of international agreements including the Quartet and the Arab League, with Egypt in the key role, that the 15 km border is patrolled to the extent that no more shots can cross into Gaza.
At the same time, the Israeli attack must be stopped.
There is one final comment I should like to make.
This is just a small first step.
If Israel wishes to have moderate Palestinians to deal with in future - which would mean a two-state solution - then, once this is all over, care must be taken at long last that the moderate Palestinians supporting President Abbas have accomplishments to show to their own population, which means an end to the resettlement policy and to several other things.
After all, if the moderates have no successful achievements to show to their people, the radicals will triumph.
This must be the starting point of a new Israeli policy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of this vast tragedy our words are liable to be inadequate.
An army that kills hundreds of civilians, women and children, places itself at the same level as the terrorism that it is claiming to combat.
On the other hand, anyone who knows Gaza, even if only through having seen it on the map, knows that no military operation could be conceived without admitting the likelihood of a massacre of civilians.
Can Israel today say that it is safer, after having given rise to so much hatred and despair?
If not with Hamas, directly or indirectly, then with whom must a way out of the blind violence be sought?
Our resolution reinforces the call for a cease-fire already expressed by the United Nations Security Council.
We urge the parties to abide by it and we call upon Europe to take action to render it possible.
The risk is that this massacre, far from vanquishing Hamas, Mr Brok, will weaken the Palestinian Authority itself even further, as well as those in the Palestinian world who have staked everything on negotiations with Israel.
We should ask ourselves, honestly, what have they actually gained so far?
Nothing.
That is the answer that we must give if we truly wish to start rooting out the hatred and the violence.
- (FR) Mr President, we are all partly responsible for what is happening today in the Middle East.
We, in Europe, and we, in the international community, have allowed the situation to get worse; we did nothing when Israel's security was under threat, and we did nothing when the blockade was making life in Gaza absolutely impossible.
Today is the 19th day of war; 995 people have been killed, including 292 children, and there are thousands of wounded, some of whom are still waiting to be evacuated.
There are tens of thousands of refugees who no longer have a home and do not know where to go.
The humanitarian situation is becoming worse and worse: 700 000 inhabitants of Gaza no longer have electricity, one-third of them no longer have water or gas, and it will soon be three weeks since this situation first began, three weeks in which these people have lived or, rather, have done their best to survive.
There is too much suffering, too much hardship, and this must end, this must stop now!
Our responsibility to ourselves, as Europeans, is not to be obliging towards anyone.
Our responsibility to ourselves, as Europeans, is to put pressure on the two parties so that they finally agree to negotiate.
It is a matter of days, perhaps even hours, before the point of no return is reached with a land offensive, particularly in Gaza town.
Israel must be guaranteed its security, and the people of Gaza must have a guarantee that they will be able to live in peace in the future.
The borders must be controlled, and the blockade must be lifted.
All of us here know that, in order to obtain this agreement, it will perhaps be necessary for Europe, the United States and the Arab states - which are meeting the day after tomorrow - to all speak with one and the same voice.
I should like to express my firm conviction before I conclude. It is not the war that must be won today, but peace.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly welcome the comments by the Commissioner and Mr Pöttering, in denouncing in no uncertain terms the grave responsibility that Hamas bears for having put an end to the truce, but equally clearly judging the Israeli reaction to be totally disproportionate.
Beyond the words, however, the crisis remains, and there are still thousands of people - the civilian population and children - who are in desperate need of humanitarian aid.
In all conscience, and without hypocrisy, perhaps we should ask ourselves some questions.
While our children were celebrating Christmas, how many children died in Gaza?
Two or three hundred; and how many Israeli civilians?
Could the international community have done more?
In my opinion, the answer is yes.
It ought to have done more.
We should feel the full weight of our responsibilities.
It is not enough to broadcast views on Hamas, on Israel, on the initial responsibility, or on who is more to blame.
Unfortunately, above and beyond the emergency, Europe remains inadequate.
In my view this is a serious inadequacy: an incapacity to build a real, strategic and lasting peace policy.
Today, clearly, we must issue a strong demand for a cease-fire, but this is not enough.
We must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the Middle East.
To finish, I would also like to refer to the words of the Pope, who said that we need to give specific answers to the general aspirations of many in those lands to live in peace, security and dignity, as Mrs Morgantini also pointed out.
Mr President, I really am finishing.
Violence, hatred and distrust are forms of poverty - perhaps the most terrible to combat.
- (FR) Mr President, in Gaza, we have seen war and we have seen death, but we have also seen people, living people, people who have the right to live and whom we have a duty to protect.
Protecting the civilian population - this is the real emergency.
Nothing can excuse the fact that not everything has been done to protect this population, and I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you feel, today, that you have done everything you can to ensure that the Israeli authorities call an immediate halt to this indiscriminate and disproportionate military operation?
The answer is most certainly 'No'.
When rumours of the operation were circulating in the embassies the Council, against Parliament's wishes, reaffirmed its determination to step up its relations.
This was a tragic mistake!
When NGOs call on the Security Council to have the International Criminal Court investigate alleged war crimes, the Council is unable to invoke the 'human rights' clause of its agreement with Israel.
I am sick of hearing that we cannot do better, that we have done all we can.
It is in fact the deadlock of your essentially humanitarian policy to alleviate the damage caused by the military occupation and the war that is the biggest failure.
How far will we have to go in terms of violations of international law before we have the 'human rights' clause applied?
If we are not capable, today, of asking ourselves questions about the scope of effective mechanisms for applying pressure and for implementing, then I do not really know what kind of situation will justify our finally taking action.
I tell you straight: if the business-as-usual approach continues and remains an ongoing part of our relations with Israel, with the 1 000 deaths in Gaza, you will bury Article 11 of the Treaty, you will bury the Union's 'human rights' policy and you will bury the European project!
(Applause)
Mr President, returning from the Gaza Strip after seeing the massacre - predominantly of civilians - I feel the urge to express my wholehearted solidarity with the Palestinian people.
For 17 days, they have been facing the enormous Israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law.
I also express support for the peace forces in Israel calling for an end to this war.
After a long closure and siege that converted Gaza into the largest open prison in the world, the building of the shameful wall around the West Bank, the continuous expansion of the settlements, and the effective division of the Palestinian land, the occupying forces have moved to the fiercest military operation.
In this, the rocket attacks against southern Israel - and I stress that I am against any attack from whichever side on civilians - served as the pretext.
The ending of the ceasefire against the background of the power games in view of the Israeli elections is an insult to a whole nation.
The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution.
Israel is a state, not an organisation; it is a member of the United Nations.
It has a responsibility towards the international community, and has to comply with this and all other resolutions adopted by the United Nations.
There should be respect for international law.
No impunity should be permitted any longer.
There should be a full international investigation.
The international community demands an immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of the military forces, access to humanitarian aid, and freedom of movement for the population.
Let UNWRA carry out its mission.
The EU has taken steps, but only at a humanitarian level.
It has to show decisiveness at the political level.
Use the clauses in the association agreements.
Stop the upgrading of relations with Israel.
Stop arms exports to Israel.
There can only be a political solution to this conflict.
There should be a full return to international law, which means ending the 42-year-long occupation of Palestine, and establishing a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, thus building a peaceful future for both Palestinian and Israeli children.
To save future generations, we need to stop the war now.
- (FR) Mr President, several thousand years ago, David confronted Goliath in order to find out whether the land was destined for the Moabites, the Philistines or the Hebrews.
Currently the same drama is continuing on this land, the source of one of the three pillars of our civilisation.
Today it is urgent, right, legitimate and necessary to ensure the security and recognition of the State of Israel.
To do so, a single solution is required, and that is to guarantee the birth of a truly sovereign Palestinian State.
Here, as elsewhere, multiculturalism has its limits.
Where there are two peoples, there must be two States.
If the European Union's aid is indeed effective, then it must be focused on one objective: that of ensuring the growth of this Palestinian constitutional state where the rule of law protects the weak and helps the strong.
There is a sense of urgency, since, on this land, the extremists on all sides are powerful and in the wrong, while the children are moderate and victims.
The solution for transcending the demands of 'an eye for an eye' is neither moral, nor military, but political.
So, it is time to get down to work!
Mr President, I abhor terrorism.
I repudiate the propaganda of terrorism.
Maybe coming from Northern Ireland heightens my awareness, so when I hear Hamas bleat because of necessary retaliatory action against its years of indiscriminate raining of rockets upon innocent citizens in Israel, then I am unimpressed because I know that Hamas, like the IRA in my country, are masters of the twin arts of terrorism and propaganda.
The situation is demonstrably clear.
Israel accepts a two-state solution.
Hamas cannot even abide the right of Israel to exist and thus unleashes endless relentless terrorist attacks upon its territory.
And when, after much forbearance, Israel hits back, they cry victim.
Sorry: they are the perpetrators and if they want peace the answer lies in their own hands.
Stop shelling Israel.
(EL) Mr President, we all realise that the situation in Gaza is tragic.
It is bordering on a humanitarian disaster and it requires immediate action.
I would like to congratulate the European Commission on having stepped up its efforts, the Presidency on its initiatives and on coordinating national action being taken in this sector, and Egypt on the important and sensitive role which it is playing.
There is now an urgent need for a ceasefire and for a cessation of hostilities on both sides, for corridors from Israeli territory and Egypt to address humanitarian needs and for border controls to stop the illegal movement of weapons and people.
As the Commissioner said, the signs for a truce plan are encouraging and I hope that it will be accepted immediately and will be respected in practice.
So what are our next moves?
Both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have already said that we need to support our objectives for viable peace and the creation of a Palestinian state which will live in peace and respect next to Israel.
They are not new.
We have announced them and we have supported them without result.
The vicious circle of violence continues with negative consequences not only for the people of Israel and the Palestinians, but for all peoples in the area and for the security of the international community.
Now we need to take stock of our actions, our political choices and our practices and take more courageous and different steps.
There is an urgent need for us to engage at bilateral level with Israel in an honest, in-depth dialogue and self-criticism within the framework of our friendly relations and partnership and for us to identify the mistakes made in promoting mutual trust between these two peoples.
We also need to strengthen this sort of dialogue with all Palestinians, to make them understand the importance of peace, cohesion, human life and unity between them.
(DE) Mr President, after Prime Minister Topolánek made some joking remarks today, I can say that, as an Austrian MEP, I am pleased that both the Commission and the Czech Council Presidency are represented by Austrians.
I wish you a very warm welcome!
President-in-Office, I realise of course that your loyalties lie with the Czech Republic.
Ladies and gentlemen, when, shortly before Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, I travelled to the country as part of a delegation with Mr Schulz, as Chairman of the delegation, the Deputy Prime Minister at the time said, 'do not interfere, this will work well'.
Others - such as former Minister for Foreign Affairs Josip Elin - said, 'this will lead to chaos' - and he was and remains right.
Unilateral disengagement without negotiations, without having a negotiating partner, does not make sense.
However, neither was it very well-advised of us to decide against entering into dialogue with even moderate representatives of Hamas - who may not even have belonged to Hamas, but rather have been nominated by it in the joint government.
By taking this position, we helped to destroy this joint government.
I know that there were some who wanted to hold talks but were not allowed to - that, too, was a mistake.
We need dialogue!
I do not like Hamas, firstly because it is a terrorist organisation and secondly because of its fundamentalist views, but this is not a matter of liking or disliking; it is a matter of solutions.
Therefore, we must return to dialogue and talks, as many of our fellow Members have already said today.
Also, the people in Gaza must be given the chance to live half-decent lives.
Why are they voting for Hamas?
The answer is that they see them as the only chance, the last chance, of even surviving - and this must be changed.
We must give these people an economic basis for survival, too; we must lift the boycott and end their isolation.
That is the only real requirement.
Mr Brok, whom I hold in very high regard, said that the principle of proportionality was not applicable - but that is not true.
The principle of proportionality applies to private as well as international law.
Anyone violating it also violates international law - and that is something this House really cannot accept.
(Applause)
Mr President, a friend who knows I was in Gaza just three days ago challenges me.
'Have you never seen pictures of five-year-old Jewish children facing Nazi rifles with their arms above their heads?' she writes.
'They break your heart.'
And her words highlight why we make allowances for Israel that we would not make for any other country.
They do not, however, explain why a people that suffered so much in the 20th century should now inflict so much suffering on another people in this one.
Israel has turned Gaza into hell: the ground is shaking with explosions, even during a ceasefire; there are donkey carts on the street and F-16s in the sky, 21st-century killing machines just dropping bombs; 300 children are dead already, hundreds more torn apart limb by limb.
This is not a proportionate response of a civilised power.
It is evil.
It is evil.
Yes, the Hamas rockets must stop.
I have said so to Hamas representatives in Gaza myself before now, but let us have no more sanctimonious talk from Israeli officials about the need to fight terrorism, because Palestinians being bombed could name terrorists and they would name Olmert, Livni and Barak.
We have some responsibility for Israel's actions.
On no occasion in the past, on no occasion I can think of, has the European Union ever backed up its criticism of the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis with any kind of action.
We give a green light to Israel to proceed as it would wish and we have compounded that failure by ignoring the lessons of history.
You cannot make peace without talking to your enemies, yet we refuse to talk to the elected representatives of the Palestinian people.
Now we are completing negotiations with Israel on an enhanced cooperation agreement.
We do not plan to condemn Israel: we intend to reward it.
Those who want peace in the Middle East, those who want to see justice for both sides, must recognise that it is time to think again.
- (GA) Mr President, the war in Gaza is frightening and scandalous.
Everyone knows that a military solution will not work in the Middle East.
A political resolution is the only way to re-establish peace and reconciliation in the area.
In order to do this, the violence must be ended immediately.
I support the creation of an independent, sustainable Palestinian state, but a reasonably good economy and a proper political plan must be but in place.
It should be our aim to ensure that those two states exist in the region and have respect for one another.
Israel is entitled to protect itself, but it has gone too far with these attacks.
The attacks are immoral, and the international community cannot accept them.
The peace process in the Middle East must be put in place immediately.
I hope that America's newly elected president, Barack Obama, will be working on this.
We wish him every success with this important duty and with the challenge ahead of him.
(ES) Mr President, I too was in Gaza a few days ago, and it was a very intense experience.
We also went to Egypt.
I believe that we are at the end of an era: the Bush era, and that the last throes of President Bush are proving particularly bloody and painful.
We are at a turning point when we can adopt a different policy towards the Middle East, in which I want the European Union to take the lead.
Mr Obama is also taking this line as he says that he will talk to Iran.
Yes, Mr Obama is going to talk to Iran and we must talk to everyone, including Hamas, in the Middle East.
This new policy in the Middle East must be a policy of cooperation and, at the very least, it must abide by our values and by international law.
The hundreds of children whom we saw in Gaza, who clung onto our arms and who looked at us with eyes full of hope deserve an answer, just like the children of Israel.
This requires concrete action; it requires action on the ground, to give hope to the moderates.
The most regrettable aspect is that Prime Minister Fayad, President Abbas, President Mubarak and King Abdullah are currently being accused of treachery in the streets of the Arab world.
When I stopped my taxi in the Sinai desert to have a coffee, we only saw Khaled Meshaal on the huge screens.
That is the result, the collateral damage of this attack on Gaza.
It will not bring peace to Israel or the security that we want, and even less so will it bring anything good for us.
If we do not stop this conflict, it will bring hatred to Europe's own streets.
(PT) One thousand is the number of the day, one thousand deaths to teach a black lesson.
Excuse my frankness: how many more lives will it cost to elect Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak in the February election?
We are here today to demand a cease-fire and an end to the slaughter of civilians.
However, the resolution also raises issues about our own liability.
It reminds us that the Council decided to upgrade diplomatic relations with Israel, against the opinion of this Parliament.
This was complicity by anticipation.
Today I hear: 'It is necessary to talk to Hamas'.
We would have saved years if we had respected the elections in Palestine.
The role of Europe is not to support the politics and the destruction imposed by the stronger side.
It is to listen to the clamour that is filling the streets and squares of our cities.
We demand a cease-fire now, but we must realise that peace depends on an end to the occupation.
This word has fallen into disuse, but it has to come off the list of banned words where it was put by power politics.
Mr President, what is happening in Gaza is heartbreaking.
That the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable.
I agree 100% that Israelis have a right to live without the threat of rocket attacks.
But what is being done in Gaza is not justice: it is slaughter.
There is no excuse; there is no possible justification.
The most shameful thing for us in the EU is that it is being carried out by one of our preferred trading partners.
In 2007 the value of EU-Israel trade was EUR 25.7 billion.
Given the amount of money we contribute to Israel's economy, we carry a grave responsibility when that money contributes to the death of civilians and children.
If we do not act, the blood of those in Gaza will equally stain our hands.
I call on this Parliament and all EU bodies to impose trade sanctions on Israel immediately and to keep them in place until a meaningful ceasefire is agreed.
If we do any less than our utmost to stop this killing, we become accessories to the slaughter.
- (FR) Mr President, once again, weapons are doing the talking in the Middle East.
Once again, the main victims are women and children, of whom thousands have been wounded and hundreds killed.
Once again, history is repeating itself, in all its horror, on Europe's doorstep.
However, we note that, in spite of its initiatives, Europe is not making an effective contribution in this major conflict, even though it is taking place in its immediate area of influence.
An overwhelming majority of the public are finding this difficult to understand, and they are increasingly refusing to accept such powerlessness.
Commissioner, we must vigorously and authoritatively take up the leadership in order to bring about peace.
The Union for the Mediterranean must play a major role, as must the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
In line with this, the European Parliament must support the Franco-Egyptian peace plan in favour of an immediate ceasefire, the securing of the borders between Israel and the Gaza Strip, the re-opening of the crossing points and, above all, the lifting of the blockade of Gaza.
We must also call for the immediate application of the UN resolution.
Once this first stage is over, we must go further by proposing the implementation of a military force, not a multinational one but a Euro-Mediterranean one.
This gesture would be the founding act of a confirmed political will to achieve a 'European peace', something for which all the peoples of the Mediterranean have been waiting for so long.
I should also like today to draw your attention to a new situation.
With the Middle East conflict, we are little by little entering very dangerous territory, that of the clash of civilisations.
Indeed, ever since the start of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there has always been a groundswell of Arab public opinion.
Today, it is Muslim public opinion, which extends far beyond the geography of the Arab states.
This suggests a radical change in the nature of the conflict.
Europe has an historic responsibility, that of urgently strengthening the dialogue between civilisations.
- (FR) Mr President, I have taken the floor so many times in this House to say that we should seize any opportunity of peace, however slight, and that, in spite of everything, we should talk to Hamas, because it won the elections, that I no longer wish to return to these subjects.
I am overcome with sadness and anger, and while I do not wish today to let myself become overwhelmed with emotion in the face of this massacre, in the face of the war propaganda that I hear around me, in the face of the confusion, in the face also of the wave of hatred and anti-Semitism that is beginning to sweep through our streets, I have but a few words to say: Europe must go back to basics, and for me, these are obvious facts, but sometimes it is good to point them out.
Firstly, a Palestinian's life is equal to an Israeli's life, but not only his life, his future and his freedom, also.
Secondly, international law must be respected, and international law of course means an immediate ceasefire.
There are all the UN resolutions and the Geneva conventions as well, however.
The fact is, this region, today, has become a lawless region where everything is seemingly permitted and where a population is being held hostage.
Thirdly, justice will have to be served for all these crimes, no matter what they are or where they are committed.
There will never be security without peace, or peace without justice.
Transitional justice does exist, it is made for that, and, if it is not applied, the hate will continue to spread.
Over the last few days we have built up a capacity for hate that will prove more dangerous than the bombs.
Europe must enforce the application of the conditions of its partnership agreements, including paragraph 2 of its association agreements on respect for human rights.
This is an obligation of these treaties from which it cannot be exempt.
Lastly, Israel is not a special case.
It has responsibilities as a State and it cannot be put on an equal footing with Hamas.
When it comes to international law, there is no such thing as a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card.
On Sunday we left behind us in Gaza a population that was caught in a trap, imprisoned in a ghetto below the bombs, and hundreds of thousands of children whose futures are today in our hands, and we came out of Gaza simply because we are Europeans.
The only Palestinians leaving Rafah are those who go feet first in ambulances, because they are dead or because they are wounded.
Europe will no longer be Europe, and no citizen will recognise himself as European if we forget these basics.
(Applause)
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by echoing the words of Mr Cohn-Bendit.
It is despair that grips us today; this war is a tragedy.
The images of suffering and of death that have flashed across our screens non-stop for three weeks now are unbearable, as are, I hasten to add, all the images of war, all the conflicts, including those that are spoken of much less, if at all, such as Congo, Darfur, Zimbabwe and, before that, Chechnya, the horrors of which took place amid a deafening media and, I would stress, political, silence.
I have already stressed on several occasions in this House the fact that the indignation of some of my fellow Members varies according to circumstances.
However, as Mrs Morgantini has also often pointed out, there are no accounts to be kept when it comes to people dying; there is no hierarchy in suffering; every casualty, be it a man, woman or child, from whichever side, is one victim too many.
So, what should we do now to ensure that our debate today is not what it often is - a somewhat pointless, futile confrontation?
Continuing to hurl abuse at each other about the historic responsibilities of the different parties seems to me to be a perfect example of such futility.
I have taken the floor late in this debate, so the arguments have been heard.
Questions can certainly be asked about the scale of the Israeli crisis and of the Israeli counterattack, but not, under any circumstances, about Israel's right to security.
Which of our western governments would agree to watch thousands of missiles fall on its citizens without reacting?
The question answers itself.
Above and beyond the call for an essential negotiated ceasefire, for a guarantee, of course, of the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for an end to the supply of weapons via the tunnels, the real issue, today, is necessarily aimed at the future.
The fundamentals of peace are well-known: they have already been identified at Taba, Camp David and Annapolis.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has made this point.
Most, though not all, of course, of the elements are on the table, and this involves sacrifices being made on both sides.
And, when I talk of sacrifice, I agree with Mr Schulz, who is not in the Chamber at present.
It is not a question of knowing whether a dialogue will be held with Hamas, but of knowing how it will be held, and under what conditions.
Most of my fellow Members have exceeded their speaking time by 50 seconds, so allow me to finish, Mr President.
The answer is that given by Yasser Arafat, in May 1989, when he declared his freedom-destroying and deadly charter null and void.
Those words, moreover, have become part of the Palestinian vocabulary.
Inter-Palestinian reconciliation, above all, comes at this price, and our role as the European Union is to get the protagonists in Palestine and Israel, but also their Arab neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, to become partners of a lasting peace agreement.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, on Sunday, 11 January, we visited the border city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, which is completely sealed off.
This means that the civilian population has no chance of escaping the daily bombardments by the Israeli army.
If you have not seen it with your own eyes you cannot imagine how much the people of Gaza are suffering and how urgent it is to reach a peaceful, definitive solution to the conflict.
We were all deeply affected on a personal level by the immensity of the suffering of the Palestinian people, and also of the devastation.
Therefore, I wish to reiterate, in the strongest terms, that the Israeli bombings must be brought to an immediate halt, as must Hamas' rocket fire into Israel, and the smuggling of arms into the Gaza Strip from Egypt must also be stopped.
In addition, the borders must be opened immediately to allow into the area the aid deliveries that are ready and waiting to supply the civilian population.
We also saw doctors at the border ready to travel into the area to provide help, but being unable to as the border was closed.
Therefore, I would appeal once again for the borders to be opened to allow the assistance to be provided.
- (CS) Mr President, who would not experience anguish on seeing children killed by a missile?
This is a terrible feeling, but it should not warrant hypocrisy.
Which European countries would show as much restraint as Israel and, for years, put up with an attack of more than 7 000 missiles, at each moment threatening the lives of more than one million civilians?
However, the inhabitants of Gaza are not just innocent victims.
They enthusiastically, knowingly, freely and democratically elected Hamas and its charter.
When they spoke of liberation, they did not mean the liberation of Gaza, which is already free, but the liberation of Tel Aviv and Haifa from the Jews and the destruction of the State of Israel.
Anyone who elects criminals must logically share their fate.
Especially when these criminals hide behind the skirts of women and children as they would hide behind hostages, when they fire missiles from schools and transform mosques into huge weapons depots.
I remember the bombing of Dresden in 1944, when British aircraft razed the city to the ground and killed 92 000 civilians, mostly women and children.
There was no hypocritical umbrage.
The Germans freely elected Hitler and shared in his fate.
The Gazans also knew who they were electing and why.
By the same token, a significant portion of the funds flowing from the EU into Gaza ended up in the hands of Hamas.
Perhaps this was so that Gazans, with full bellies and well provided for by the EU, could devote all of their attention to excavating tunnels for smuggling in increasingly lethal weapons to be used against Israeli civilians.
Proportional indeed!
(SV) Mr President, there are two important things that characterise the debate here today.
The first is that an overwhelming majority of this Parliament wants to bring about a quick ceasefire.
The second is that there is overwhelming support for the requirement for all parties involved to accept the state of Israel's right to exist within peaceful borders.
This is the starting point that is important for the European Union.
It is important, because it is a tragedy that we are witnessing in Gaza.
Every life that is lost is a tragedy, whichever side of the border they are on.
Let us not think that this tragedy would be any less if those who deliberately kill civilians succeed in reaching even further in amongst civilians by means of rocket fire.
It is also a tragedy because it creates obstacles to the realisation of a Palestinian state and thus a peaceful solution.
It is a tragedy that is also befalling the international community, because what is happening now has not happened overnight, but has been built up through rearmament, through the smuggling of weapons and through rocket fire over a long period.
What is important for us to see is that this is not a tragedy that is built on conflict between Jews and Palestinians.
I strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation.
When I heard Mr Davies trying to lay the blame on a nation, I heard a tone that I do not think should be heard in this Parliament.
It is not a conflict between Palestinians and Jews, it is not a conflict between Israel and the Palestinian authority, it is a conflict between extremists and moderate forces in the region.
Let us support the moderate forces by making it clear to everyone who is pursuing hatred and wants to eliminate the state of Israel that they will not succeed.
If Europe sends out this message, we will also strengthen the moderate forces and lay a better foundation for peace.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to address those who have detonated their charges of deception and demagogy in this House.
This is one in a series of wars, each of which has its similarities, but also its differences.
The conflict we are discussing today is an asymmetrical conflict.
For three years, Israel was bombarded with home-made missiles, and not a single word of censure was uttered in this House against those who fired them. Today we are condemning Israel.
It is easy to condemn Israel, because it is a member of the UN.
It has something to condemn, it has authorities.
There is a government that can be condemned and censured.
On the other side is a terrorist organisation whose real identity is not known.
An organisation which plays with the lives of innocent people by acting behind their backs.
Another asymmetrical element is that we count the Palestinians who have been dramatically killed while being used as human shields, without countering this with the Israelis who have been killed and the thousands who live under threat, because bloodshed cannot be compensated by more bloodshed.
But the worst thing in this House is the asymmetry between words and actions.
It is easy for us to talk, but very hard to take effective action.
Without an international presence, this conflict will never be resolved.
Finally I would like to address those protesting against Israel's disproportionate action.
Ladies and gentlemen, would you want a terrorist organisation to fire 7 000 missiles from Israel into Gaza?
Would that be proportionality?
Because this is a disproportionate conflict in which the law is ineffective, we will have to simply get used to it, otherwise we will just be going round in circles and using words which are not backed up by reality.
Opinions uttered in front of the television by a warm fire are not adequate to the truth about this conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, I really must insist now that you keep to your speaking time.
I have never interrupted speakers, even when their speaking time had elapsed, but Mr Schwarzenberg is already giving us more of his time than we were expecting.
He has until 5.20 p.m. at the latest, I have been told.
I would entreat you to bear in mind the time for which you applied.
Being a general, Mr Morillon will set a good example.
- (FR) Mr President, achieving a lasting calm in Gaza will be possible only if a multinational intervention force is deployed under UN control.
For the first time, Israel seems resigned to this solution, which has been demanded time and time again by the Palestinians.
I do not know when this force will be able to intervene; intervention will not be possible before an agreement has been reached between the parties to the conflict, but we all hope that this will be as soon as possible.
I do know, however, that this mission will require those conducting it to be completely impartial.
I believe that the European Union will therefore be in the best position to take action and - why not, Mr Pöttering? - to do so within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean.
It will be in the best position to take action since, rightly or wrongly, the Americans are considered to have sided with the Israelis, and the Arabs, with the Palestinians.
Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we ought to prepare ourselves for this?
Mr President, long-lasting conflict and occupation give rise to anger, rage and disappointment at the efficacy of legal authorities, producing something we call the 'Hamas effect', as a serious factor.
The denial of Israel by Arabs, Islamics and Hamas is unacceptable, as is using children as human shields.
Neither should the constant threat under which Israeli children live be allowed.
The question is whether, in this vicious circle of aggression, the present Israeli authorities are able to take the lesson from the six-year-long history in the area, and apply the scalpel-like strategy for two states.
I know that they fear the threat from an aggressive and unpredictable neighbour shelling them with rockets, but in this matter the international community, including the EU, could come with help.
Is this risky solution acceptable, today, to Israel?
But is there any other solution?
If there is, tell me.
To expect Hamas to die out naturally, or by bombing them out, looks like a naïve expectation, so more courage is needed by Israel.
The Western powers did not create two states in 1948, but they should do so now.
The core responsibility does not fade away.
Let us be more courageous in this strategy.
(SL) The Israeli state has ordered the Israeli army to destroy Hamas in Gaza.
However, the Israeli army is eradicating Hamas by killing Palestinians in Gaza.
One third of all the dead are children and half of all the dead are women and children - but they are not members of Hamas.
The extent of the military violence is huge and disproportionate.
And how can a ceasefire be achieved when neither party recognises the other's legitimacy?
The enemy needs to be perceived, not as the object of attack and destruction, but as a subject, a partner with whom a ceasefire is possible and who will be responsible for preserving peace in the future.
Israel has to recognise Hamas and initiate dialogue with them, and vice versa - Hamas has to recognise Israel.
There is no other way.
Any kind of peace is better than bloody conflict.
Military violence must immediately give way and priority to a political solution.
However, Mr Ehud Olmert, the Israeli Prime Minister, is still trying to boost his bedraggled reputation by not allowing a ceasefire.
- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, let me congratulate you on the results of your joint negotiations, the troika negotiations in Israel.
Unlike the press, we know that it was your mission which led the Israeli side to debate the opening-up of humanitarian corridors and a daily ceasefire.
I think this is the first time the Israelis have accepted Europe as a major partner and the Czech Presidency as an important representative.
Despite enormous pressure from the left, the European Parliament yesterday agreed on a quite exceptional resolution.
Even in such extreme circumstances, this is a balanced resolution, a resolution that can be supported by the right, a resolution which is not just a pamphlet or a political victory for the left.
We have avoided inserting an equals sign, however notional, between an existing State and a terrorist movement.
Recognising the existence of the State of Israel, renouncing violence and the entry of Hamas into PLO agreements remain the key objectives, as does the requirement of achieving a permanent ceasefire as soon as possible.
Yet we have provided no added value.
The three leading Israeli representatives, Barak, Livni and Olmert, are currently at odds over the conditions and guarantees under which they are willing to implement a ceasefire.
The key is clearly Egypt and it consists in a guarantee of tunnel checks and smuggling checks which would be acceptable to the Egyptian side.
What is the Council doing at this time?
How is it proceeding in negotiations with the Egyptian side on the technical mission, international monitoring, technical surveillance, and the opening of the EU BAM Rafah?
What can the MEPs meeting tonight with the Egyptian ambassador demand of the Egyptian side, or vice versa, how can we contribute to the negotiations with Egypt?
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to step up pressure on both sides of the conflict in order to stop the ongoing violence.
We have here Security Council Resolution 1860 and we must comply with its provisions.
It is necessary to adopt safeguards ensuring the long-term ceasefire and to allow a humanitarian corridor to be opened.
It has been stated repeatedly here that there is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The road to lasting peace leads only through political negotiations.
Here it is necessary for the European Union, in cooperation with the new United States government and the League of Arab States, to play a much more prominent political role than has been the case thus far.
The long-running conflict must be ended through a political agreement based on a two-state solution, enabling Israelis and Palestinians to live together in peace within secure, internationally recognised borders, and striving to build a peaceful system of regional security throughout the Middle East.
Mr President, we are debating yet another humanitarian tragedy in our neighbourhood - next door to my country - by two of our partners in the Mediterranean.
Alas, the Palestinians have not yet accepted that suicide bombs or Kassam rockets will never deliver liberation from the occupation of their land.
Israel does not realise that such an extensive military response nourishes new potential suicide bombers and invites new Kassams at the first possible opportunity.
What about the innocent civilians, the non-combatants, women and children?
Nobody cares about them.
Nobody cares about children killed, mutilated, burned and traumatised by the hundreds - children of Israel and of Palestine.
We, from the comfort of our television sets, feel nauseated watching them.
How about those on the ground?
What can we do?
Just entering into the classic blame game does not help the civilians.
Making calls and resolutions does not help the civilians.
How can we pass from words to deeds?
The time is right to negotiate with the interested parties the formation of an international force - as was suggested by other colleagues - to go into Gaza with a large police component composed of Arab countries to train and help a Palestinian authority police force in a large UN mandate to impose law and order, as well as a military European force to ensure there is an end to rocket firing and weapon smuggling, and that there is the full opening of the crossings.
We can no longer leave the fate of the civilians in the hands of the opposing sides.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great Italian anti-fascist, Piero Gobetti, said that when the truth lies all on one side, to adopt a Solomon-like position is to be totally biased.
That is the case for Gaza at the moment; I hope that Parliament will be able to say the right words to stop Israel.
If it does not do so, it will be seen as shameful by history, the Palestinians, European public opinion and Arab public opinion.
Israel is bombing and decimating a ghetto.
The sons of those who were exterminated have become exterminators.
There is no excuse for this, nor is the argument that Israel has a right to its own security enough.
Anybody, if he wishes to, can see that nobody is today able to threaten Israel's security or its existence.
This is clear from the imbalance of forces on the ground; it is clear from the numbers of the dead and wounded; it is clear from the support that the West continues to lavish on Israel.
The only purpose of this massacre is to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state.
In this way, peace is being killed, and therefore we need to stop Israel.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Czech minister for foreign affairs, because they are still with us; we are not very used to a strong presence in this Chamber, such as that demonstrated today by the Czech Presidency.
I believe that Mrs Muscardini is right; I advise those who do not know what things are like in that area and who need to be able to express precise opinions to go and see how things are on the ground, by going either as a tourist or for other purposes.
Some of us have been to Palestine under various circumstances, as observers for the Abu Mazen elections or other elections, and I believe that only seeing things in person can give one an accurate idea of how things stand.
I believe that throughout these events, which date back decades and are not just recent, the only losers have been ourselves in the western world, because we have never seriously tackled this problem and never sought to resolve it; we continue to see it as a problem between two opposing parties.
I have been to Palestine several times, and I have been to Israel several times, so I know the situation, not perfectly, but well enough, and I believe that in reality there are not two parties involved there but three.
In this specific case the problem is between the terrorists and the state of Israel, and the Palestinian people are the victims caught in the middle.
Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people; perhaps it represents a section of it, but it certainly does not represent the entire Palestinian people.
I have a film, which I believe that many Members will have had; the film shows all the Israeli victims, including children and people of all ages, victims of all the rockets that have been fired and are still being fired by Hamas.
It is no accident that there is a large difference between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
I address this comment to the President-in-Office of the Council, and to our fine Commissioner, representing Europe.
I believe that we need to tackle the situation properly.
I believe that the most important thing of all is that today the position of Abu Mazen should be reinforced; he is the weakest figure of all in this situation, together with the Palestinians, who count for nothing in this affair.
I believe that the real losers are all of us.
(EL) Mr President, public opinion throughout Europe is calling for one thing from the Union: to put a stop to the slaughter of the Palestinian people.
We must condemn blind violence whatever its origin, but we need to be consistent in recognising that Israel is responding with state terrorism on a massive scale.
The asymmetrical retaliation, the blatant disregard for any concept of international and humanitarian law on the part of Israel cannot be tolerated.
It is unacceptable for white phosphorus bombs and experimental weapons to be used against civilians and it is inhumane for innocent women and children to be targeted.
If this happened in Africa or some other part of the world, our reaction would be immediate and the UN Security Council resolution would be binding.
However, in the case of Israel, we confine ourselves to statements and fruitless discussion.
I believe that we should use every political tool, including the Association Agreement, to persuade Israel to stop the illegal violence against the Palestinian people and to stop prohibiting access to humanitarian aid.
We cannot be bystanders because that makes us complicit in the slaughter.
The only solution is an immediate ceasefire and the opening of humanitarian corridors to Gaza and the start of dialogue with all sides.
Mr President, the horrific events in Gaza during the past two weeks have brought international condemnation against Israel.
We have witnessed colleagues during this debate today lining up to see who could express the strongest outrage against the Jewish State.
However, for one country in the Middle East, this was exactly the outcome it had sought: Iran has supplied missiles, munitions and other sophisticated weaponry to Hamas for years.
It has provided money and training for Hamas fighters.
Its objective was to provoke Israel into a ground war and the bloody result, with gruesome photos of dead children on TV screens and in newspapers around the world, is the best possible recruiting sergeant for fundamentalist Islam and the Iranian mullahs' vision of a global Islamist movement united against the West.
The fascist regime in Tehran is the main sponsor of war and terror in the Middle East, and the tragic outcome is exactly what Tehran wanted.
It distracts domestic attention in Iran from the economic crisis caused by the collapse in the price of oil, and it distracts international attention from the mullahs' rush to produce a nuclear weapon.
Iran's foreign policy objective is to become the dominant regional power in the Middle East.
It wants to unite the Islamic world in submission to its own austere and disturbing vision of a totalitarian Islamic brotherhood, where human rights, women's rights and freedom of speech are ground into the dust, and, shamefully, the West has done nothing to confront or expose Iranian aggression.
Faced with mounting evidence of the mullahs' sponsorship of terror, the West has gone out of its way to appease Tehran, even agreeing to its primary demand of disabling the main Iranian opposition movement, the People's Mujahedin of Iran, by placing it on the EU terror list.
This must stop.
Mr President, firstly, let us be clear that this Parliament will today support the UN Security Council Resolution 1860.
It should be implemented without delay.
As one of the MEPs here who has been in Gaza through the blockade, a ceasefire and a withdrawal are not enough.
Of course we want the rockets to stop and the terrorists to stop their movements, but we must see a ceasefire and an end to the blockade so that the people of Gaza can begin to live their lives.
This is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law.
Human Rights Watch and Islamic Relief have told me that the three-hour daily pause is simply woefully inadequate to get in and to distribute aid.
It is an issue of proportionality.
Save the Children say that the killing of 139 children since the conflict began, with 1 271 injured, cannot be justified as self-defence.
I welcome the statement today by the EU envoy in Israel, Ramiro Cibrian-Uzal, who said that the EU and Israel have put negotiations on the upgrading of relations 'on hold' at this time for these reasons.
So they should.
(DE) Mr President, first we need an immediate and permanent ceasefire on both sides - there is a broad consensus on this in this House.
However, afterwards, we - the EU and the international community - cannot leave the fate of the people in the Gaza Strip in the hands of Hamas and Israel alone.
Hamas does not have the interests of the inhabitants of Gaza at heart, as it knew very well that Israel would respond to constant rocket attacks - and not only during election campaigns.
During the last year, surveys in Gaza have shown a fall in political support for Hamas in favour of Fatah.
It seems that Hamas is cynically counting on political support for Hamas increasing again with the large number of Palestinian victims, out of victim solidarity.
Israel, on the other hand, has almost exclusively the interests of its own citizens in mind, and so international criticism is directed mainly at the extent of Israel's military operation and at the country's acceptance of the large number of civilian casualties.
Therefore, we Europeans should not stop at negotiating a further ceasefire and financing the repair of the infrastructure.
I can already see the Commissioner's letter of amendment: I am sure the draft is already finished and ready for submission to the Committee on Budgets.
Nor is it sufficient to keep an eye on whether Egypt closes the tunnel system at the border with the Gaza Strip to arms smuggling.
I call for the whole Quartet, including a strong Arab presence, to make a joint commitment to sending troops with a robust peacekeeping mandate to the Gaza Strip and the surrounding area - in the interests of the people in Gaza, Israel and Egypt.
In parallel, the peace process itself must be driven forward rapidly.
Otherwise, I fear that we shall see the kind of incidents we have been seeing in Gaza with ever greater frequency, and neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis deserve this.
(ES) Mr President, the Spanish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament view the situation in Gaza with horror, pain and shame, but also with a commitment to defend peace, protect those who are suffering most and maintain dignity and hope.
Our horror is at the repeated scenes of murdered children and women heartbroken in their endless suffering following the bombing of the ghetto that Gaza has become.
Picasso depicted this same horror in his Guernica painting of our Guernica razed to the ground by the Junkers of the Condor Legion seven decades ago.
Our pain is at the enormous suffering of so many victims.
Our shame is at the inability of everyone - our countries, the European Union and the international community - to firstly prevent and secondly end the criminal aggression which we condemn.
Our shame and also indignation are at so many lies, so much ambiguity and so much hot air.
Our shame is because we know exactly what is happening, yet we are not acting with the necessary forcefulness and coherence.
History will therefore demand an explanation from many as accessories to the crime, at the very least due to their failures.
As it is always 'better late than never' and as it is vital to keep open a door to hope, the European Union must support the belated Security Council resolution.
However, it must ensure that this is strictly observed, just as our association agreement with Israel must also be strictly observed, which provides for its suspension in the event of behaviour such as that which is occurring.
Incidentally, is Hamas also responsible for the media blackout that I have not yet heard anyone condemn?
Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy for all the innocent people, both in Israel and in Gaza, who have suffered in recent weeks and months as conflict rages.
But we need to take care that our natural humanity, our very justified concerns, do not distort our view of the true nature of the situation that we are dealing with.
In Gaza, Hamas has created a terrorist fiefdom: it tolerates no opposition to its views, it has murdered those Palestinians who opposed it, it has split the Palestine Authority, it refused to stop terror attacks on Israeli civilians, it refused to recognise the right of Israel to exist, it refused to acknowledge the peace agreements previously negotiated.
I recall the words of Hanan Ashrawi three years ago, when I was monitoring the Palestinian elections.
She foresaw the imposition of rule by the forces of darkness - how right she was!
We should not be surprised that a Hamas MP should take pride in stating that death was an 'industry' for the Palestinian people.
He was referring to the use of suicide bombers and the deliberate use of civilian human shields to protect potential military targets.
It is, of course, a direct contravention of international humanitarian law to use civilians in this way.
Faced with such an intractable, callous and hateful enemy, what do we expect Israel to do while its citizens are constantly subjected to terror attacks?
The international community took little notice.
When Israel took non-violent action, such as imposing blockades or cutting electricity, it was castigated.
Now that it has taken military action in reaction to Hamas provocation, it feels the weight of international disapproval.
The sad reality is that the Palestinian people have been atrociously served over many years by those who have control over Palestine Authority areas, by the international community, which has tolerated extremism and corruption, and by the Arab world, which has done nothing practical over many decades to improve their lives or prospects.
We need a Marshall Plan for the Middle East.
It is not just peacekeepers that the Palestinians need but a decent civil administration, free from corruption.
The civil administration needs to be put under international control but first of all the terrorist lifeline - weapons, monies and political indulgence - must be cut.
Mr President, I could agree with what Mr Van Orden says about Hamas, but the fact is that none of what he says justifies the bombing of civilians by Israel.
That is the fundamental point: we have to stop the bombing, whether it is coming from Hamas or coming from Israel.
I hope the resolution accompanying this debate will receive a strong vote in this House tomorrow, and I hope it will strengthen the hands of the Commission and the Council in pressuring both Israel and Hamas to stop the killing.
Since Israel withdrew from Gaza, it has turned it into the largest prison in the world, and for the last three weeks it has turned it into a slaughterhouse, illegally using terror against terror, killing civilian men, women and children, and killing the possibility of a viable two-state solution in the process.
There can be no upgrading of Europe's relations with Israel so long as it fails to engage in constructive and substantive negotiations with its neighbours and all the Palestinian elected members, including Hamas.
It should be made clear by Europe that any escalation of this war on Gaza will be followed by an escalation of our reaction to that war.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioners, members of Council, fellow Members, I find the behaviour of the parties in the Gaza conflict to be cynical.
I consider it cynical and unacceptable that Hamas uses the civilian population - even children - as a human shield.
I consider cynical and inhumane the Israeli stance which, on the pretext of self-defence, uses disproportionate means, shooting masses of Gaza residents and most severely affecting the civilian population, including children.
I consider cynical and mendacious a foreign diplomacy which, with notable exceptions, strives to maintain appearances and yet even after so many days is unable to secure protection for the civilian population or aid agencies, and unfortunately is unable to protect children either.
I speak up for the children, because no end can justify the means of unnecessarily ending innocent lives.
We must consider each child's life to be of equal value, on either side of the border.
This is the fundamental axiom which each party to the conflict must hold equally important, if there is ever to be true peace in that region.
Acceptance of the values of respect for human life, protection of civilians and promotion of humanitarian aid can form the foundation for reaching a lasting ceasefire, achieving peace within Palestine and between Palestine and Israel.
Mr President, Hamas unleashed terror on Israel's citizens and has provoked retaliation.
It seems from this distance that some of them relish the new civilian - including child - martyrs and the publicity it gives their cause, no matter how horrible it is for right-thinking people to take that in.
I have never given succour to terrorism, nor am I a critic of Israel, which has a right to peaceful coexistence in the region, but we would have to be turnips not to feel emotional upset and moral shame at what is happening at present in Gaza.
The Israeli response is totally disproportionate and the deaths of young children are particularly shameful.
I have not, to date, opposed the new EU-Israel agreement.
I believe the advice of the Dalai Lama last month here in Parliament that the best way to influence China on Tibet is to keep good relations with them.
I think that also applies to EU-Israel relations, but how can we get their attention to express the level of revulsion felt here at the scale of what is happening?
I may add that yesterday a note on the humanitarian needs of the region was distributed to those of us who attended the joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Development Committee.
I urge the Commission and the Council to ensure that a totally comprehensive humanitarian aid package is ready so that we can move in there and help these suffering people at the first opportunity.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, one thing that was mentioned at the beginning was whether we should contact Hamas.
I do not think it is yet time to do so.
In the last months, Hamas still definitely behaved as a terrorist organisation.
As long as it behaves as such, it cannot be officially contacted by the representatives of the European Union.
I admit, being an old man, that I have seen many terrorist organisations during my time growing up from their beginnings, becoming more or less acceptable, and being accepted by the international community.
I have seen it in Africa.
I have seen it in Ireland.
I have seen it in many places.
That happens.
But first of all they have to stop acting as a terrorist organisation.
Then I will be ready to speak with Hamas or with anybody else, but not before they have given up acting as a terrorist organisation.
I think it is important to state this, because the European Union cannot give up its principles.
There are ways of hearing what their ideas are, there are indirect contacts with politicians in the region who are in contact with them, which is important and good, but it is not yet time for the European Union to have direct contacts with Hamas.
I think we should be adamant about that.
In other respects, we should praise Egypt very much for its important role in the last weeks and days for its efforts and hard work on achieving a ceasefire and maybe even an armistice with, at the very end of the process, peace in the region.
I know how difficult the question is.
We are in contact with the Egyptians the whole time.
We know what important work they are doing, and I would like to congratulate them.
There was a question on how we can assist in the region.
First of all, those who are on the spot will tell us clearly what they need.
It is not for us to decide what we should give them.
They have to ask us and the European Union.
Many European Union Member States have stated their readiness to help in every possible way - technical ways, sending advisors, preparing whatever means are necessary - but this must, first of all, be with the consent of the relevant states there.
That is the first task to be carried out.
I heard one important suggestion, which was to prepare a Marshall Plan for the Middle East.
I think it is a very good idea and we should follow it.
This region really needs a genuine build-up of the ideas which helped Europe so much after the war.
Ms Ferrero-Waldner and others mentioned what the mission achieved.
I think we achieved a lot, and I would like once again to commend Ms Ferrero-Waldner, who did the main work in our delegation in the humanitarian sphere, where what we have achieved still works today.
But, let us be clear, even these very difficult negotiations in the Middle East are based on the design already structured during our delegation's visit to the Middle East.
This basically deals with how to organise peace and what is necessary.
Our plan is based on what we found out then and discussed with our partners.
There was a discussion about upgrading our relations with Israel.
As you know, that was a decision taken by the Council of Ministers of the European Union in June 2008.
This can be changed only if the ministers of the European Union decide to alter the decision.
It cannot be changed, even by the words of a very respectable representative of the European Union in Jerusalem.
I admit that in the current situation it would be premature to discuss how to upgrade our relationship with Israel and whether there should be a summit in the foreseeable future.
For the moment we really have more urgent and more important questions to solve.
Again, I would state that the decision was taken by the Council of Ministers, and that is it.
What can be done to stop Israel?
Let us be frank - very little.
Israel acts as it acts and, being a lifelong friend of Israel, which I state today and I state quite frankly, I am not so happy with what it is doing at the moment.
I think its politics are also harming Israel.
That is one thing, but the European Union does have very few possibilities, other than speaking very clearly and very honestly and asking our partners to stop it.
The solution has to be found by our partners in the Middle East, by Israel, by Egypt and the others involved.
The European Union can help there.
The European Union can assist by offering every type of help if a ceasefire is agreed to achieve the stated aims: closing the smuggling passes, closing the tunnels, guarding the sea etc.
It can help in Gaza in many ways, such as reconstruction or assisting with humanitarian aid.
The European Union can do all that, but, to be quite honest, we do not have the power and means to say 'stop'.
Does Parliament think we can send a huge armed force to the Middle East to stop the fighting parties?
No.
We do not have the possibilities, and both Israel and Hamas are dependent on powers other than European powers.
Israel has mighty allies outside of Europe too.
There are limits on our power to achieve something.
We can help, we can assist, we can offer our good services and we can be very engaged.
In that respect, we have achieved quite a lot.
But do not overstate our possibilities.
Mr President, Israel states it is exercising its right to self-defence.
In that case, the rudiments of the just war principles, including proportionality, must be adhered to.
The fact that Israel is ignoring this is patently clear, and for us to ignore this fact is patently wrong.
The use of phosphorus on civilians with the claim of civilisation is not compatible.
Clearly, the EU alone cannot resolve this.
But there is a white elephant in the room.
We need the resolve of the USA.
Their disappointing response has been imbalanced and unjust.
The timing of these actions by Israel has been strategically calculated, but, Mr Obama, 20 January is fast approaching.
The world is waiting and the EU is a willing partner!
Will you restore those values we share with you or will you allow such injustice to prevail - yet again?
Will you work with us to provide protection for all concerned?
The Palestinians ask you - how can it be right that your country asks for humanitarian aid on the ground, but remains silent when there are only bombs from the skies?
Colleagues wanting to break Hamas with military means alone: go and see Gaza and the West Bank.
Reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why Hamas gains strength.
This is not the way to help Israel or Palestinians.
An immediate ceasefire is only a necessary start.
Mr President, it is very clear that the parties to this conflict are failing to respect international humanitarian law and that the civilian population of Gaza is consequently paying a very heavy price.
There must be accountability in international law where such warfare principles as proportionality and non-discrimination are not respected.
One of the tenets of a just war provides that conduct should be governed by the principle of proportionality.
The force used must be proportional to the wrong endured.
Unfortunately we have seen a large degree of carelessness by the Israelis.
While acknowledging the fact that Hamas began the rocket attacks against Israel, the Israeli reaction has, in my opinion, been disproportionate.
The numbers speak for themselves: over 900 Palestinians have been killed in contrast to a much smaller number of Israelis.
Israel must realise its responsibility to measure its use of force right away in compliance with international law.
On the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that Hamas is still listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and continues to refuse to renounce its arms struggle.
Not only that, but Hamas has consistently declined to recognise Israel's right to exist.
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups must recognise that the people of southern Israel have a right to live without bombardment.
Mr President, for all those who observe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this might be a time in which we are tempted to put our hands in the air and scream in despair.
I do not think we should, however, because I think the greatest test of our humanity today is to really understand the issues at hand.
The first issue is that there can be no lasting solution to this conflict without stopping the bombardment of Israel.
The second issue is that there cannot be a lasting solution to this conflict without opening Gaza to humanitarian aid.
Indeed, President Peres has been absolutely right in saying that Gaza should be open for aid and not enclosed for rockets.
I think this is quintessential, and everyone agrees to this.
There cannot be a return to the status quo ante, and I think we could do a number of things here.
Firstly Parliament can bring both sides together to talk; secondly we should stand behind the Commission and the Council and support their efforts; and finally we should firmly support the Egyptian track of negotiations, because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to the ceasefire which we currently all hope for.
Mr President, it is not just the Members of this House who have been outraged by developments in Gaza.
The European public have also been outraged by the suffering of the people in Gaza and the Israeli blockade for far too long.
Added to this are the constant attacks and the terrifying Israeli military assaults on innocent civilians, especially women and children.
The calls by the world community for an immediate ceasefire are falling on deaf ears.
Palestinians need urgent access to food, medical aid and security.
Israel must, at the very least, respect the principles of international law.
Unless it does so, Israel should lose any remaining support it has from the international community.
It is unfortunate that the UN's resolution has been sidelined.
It is also regrettable that the EU still needs to find a role.
Perhaps it can do so if it takes stronger measures than it has done so far.
It is not enough just to put the upgrading of the relationship on ice.
We have leverage.
We are a major trading partner.
We are a major funder in that region.
So we are able to exercise that role.
Mr President, is it ethically acceptable and is it excusable in international law that, in its endeavour to neutralise Hamas terrorists, the State of Israel can embark on a major military campaign of terror and gross violation of UN conventions and human rights against 1.5 million trapped, innocent civilians?
Is such action consistent with our own EU values of justice and democracy?
Is the Israeli lobby so strong that it can cause the US and the EU to - in effect - stand idle and just watch unspeakable atrocities being committed in the name of the fight against terror?
If the answer to these questions is yes, then we should all commend as brave the Israeli Government for their action in Gaza. If the answer is no, then we should strongly and clearly condemn Israel and must take swift and effective steps against it, including trade sanctions, in order to end the carnage in Gaza today and in the future.
I disagree strongly with the minister who left, who said that we can in effect do very little.
We can do a lot and we must.
Mr President, I was elected to this House 25 years ago.
This is probably the most important debate in which I have taken part.
Madam Commissioner, I hope you listened very carefully to the Foreign Affairs Committee last night and to this Parliament today.
I hope you may reply in your debate to say, unlike President-in-Office Schwarzenberg, that there is moral power that the European Union may exert on the aggressor on this particular occasion.
The Israeli people are a just and honourable people who have suffered miserably throughout the centuries in this continent.
They will understand your recommendation to the Council of Ministers now that the EU should withdraw any contact with the Israeli authorities until they stop the bombing.
(ES) Mr President, we must tell Israel with absolute conviction to stop killing and to allow the wounded to be treated and the victims to be fed.
It must be told that its attitude towards international law will have consequences for its relations with Europe.
I want to congratulate the few young European voluntary workers who are suffering together with the people of Gaza, in particular Alberto Arce.
They represent the best of the values of solidarity and freedom held by this Europe of ours, which needs to act accordingly in such a terrible conflict.
(DA) Mr President, I just want to say two things.
First of all, I would like to remind everyone that our decision expressly states, and reiterates, that we have put our support for upgrading on hold, and I very much hope that we will not merely carry on as if nothing has happened just because the Presidency says so.
My second point is that Israel has at no time delivered what it promised in connection with the negotiations.
There was no ceasefire because Israel did not actually lift its blockade during that period, and I feel I must also raise Annapolis, where Israel promised to freeze settlement activity.
What actually happened?
It simply went and increased the rate of settlement.
The rate of settlement building has never been as rapid as it has been since Annapolis, and I believe that as long as no progress is made on the ground we will never get Hamas to act in accordance with the rules we want it to play by and that, for that reason, we must ensure that Israel fulfils its side of the bargain.
Mr President, yesterday we had a joint meeting of the Delegations for Relations with Israel and with the PLC, and one can imagine the intensity, emotion, accusations - and the suggested solutions - after 18 days of war in Gaza and around 1 000 deaths.
The fact is that Israel, after eight years of waiting and absorbing around 8 000 missiles that terrorised one million citizens along the Gaza borders, finally ran out of patience.
They began securing safety for their citizens, as is their full right and obligation.
Hamas is a terrorist organisation and is the clear culprit and a burden for the Palestinian people in Gaza.
The solution lies in an invigorated Quartet and particularly in redoubling the joint effort between the new US administration and a stronger and more integrated EU.
I welcome the Czech presidency, its priorities and its immediate and active involvement in the region.
(RO) This conflict, which has lasted a very long time, is based on problems to do with territory, as well as cultural differences which are sometimes treated in an exaggerated manner.
The long-term solution is a protected, secure Israeli state, along with a sustainable Palestinian state.
This solution cannot be achieved, however, through terrorist attacks or armed actions.
In order to achieve a normal way of life, the Palestinian people need to create for themselves a state based on democratic institutions and the rule of law, which would ensure economic development.
They need to renounce terrorist acts and turn their concerns to creating a normal political climate, facilitating the election of politicians to lead the state, who genuinely wish to resolve this conflict through negotiation.
(GA) Mr President, I would like to lend my support to those condemning the attacks and to show my solidarity with the people of Gaza.
Minister Schwarzenburg says that the European Union cannot do very much.
The European Union should abandon the upgrade of relations with Israel and the agreements that are currently in force should be cancelled until Israel fulfils its duties under international law.
Even before the recent immoral attacks, we saw years of collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
The scale and type of attacks carried out on Gaza by a modern army against a besieged people, who are already weak as a result of isolation and siege, is absolutely horrific.
The blame that was put on those same people was wrong - we must be clear in saying that the biggest victims here are people, the innocent people of Gaza.
(PL) It is with great pain that we observe what is going on in the Gaza strip.
We do not support Hamas' methods of fighting and provocation, but Israel has chosen a disproportionate means of resolving its dispute with the Palestinian people.
There has been a definite violation of the principles of international law.
Neither party to the conflict is interested in peace for the other party.
Both parties see only their own interest - that is national egotism.
International opinion is against the continuation of this war.
The European Union and the UN, supported by many countries, should intervene decisively.
It is time to end this unfortunate war.
Israeli troops should return to their barracks.
Hamas has to stop firing rockets at Israel.
We must guarantee more urgent humanitarian aid to the civilian population and administer care to the casualties, of whom there are said to be approximately 3 000.
We need to build the country up and help it return to normal life.
That is the scenario I ask from the current leadership of the European Union and the European Commission.
Mr President, I would just like to ask whether we will still be having a debate on gas today or whether it has been deleted from the agenda.
We are waiting here.
There is not only a Middle East debate but also one on gas on the agenda.
Has it been deleted from the agenda?
That is the next item on the agenda.
(SL) I was disappointed by the last announcement by the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, which is currently heading the Council.
Of course, we can pin all our hopes on our Commissioner.
But the death toll is rising.
If we continue to talk in this manner, in a week's time 1 500 people will probably be dead.
Speaking to Hamas is difficult.
It is on the list of terrorist organisations and it is difficult to take action against it.
Israel, on the other hand, is our friend, Israel is our partner and an important member of the international community.
Israel has to abide by international decisions, the resolutions of the United Nations and also by the recommendations of its friends and partners.
If it fails to do so, its friends and partners must be able to condemn its actions and to threaten sanctions against it, as well.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be brief because it was a very long debate.
Let me say first of all, as a member of the Middle East Quartet for four years now, the European Union has a role to play, but of course we do not have the strongest role to play.
That is sometimes frustrating for all of us, particularly in such a difficult moment when you would like to immediately achieve a durable and sustainable ceasefire as we have proposed, but when it can, unfortunately, not be achieved so quickly.
I would like to give you, at least tentatively, the latest information that I got now, which is in the news, saying that sources in Egypt close to negotiations report that Hamas is reacting favourably to the latest Egyptian proposals.
There is movement in any case.
I am not yet sure whether this is really confirmed, but there will also be a Hamas press conference in the evening at 20.00.
Hopefully things will go forward.
At least, this is what we all want.
Second, despite all the frustrations, we have no other possibility than to go on working for peace.
This is what we will do.
I am committed to that as long as I am a member of this Middle East Quartet.
We can only achieve it together and we also have to help and enhance Palestinian reconciliation efforts, because only then will it be possible to totally avoid the anomaly of Gaza.
Third, as soon as there is a ceasefire we will try to do everything to totally restore the basic services to the population that have been so badly disrupted.
I think, most importantly, what is necessary now is to put an end to this destruction and to go for reconstruction and try to come to peace.
We have talked at length about this, so I will not extend myself, but this is my spirit and I hope there is a good moment.
To conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Given the barbarity that has struck the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, which the recent resolution of the UN Human Rights Council denounces and condemns, what is required and demanded is the following:
A firm denunciation of the violations of human rights and of the crimes perpetrated by the Israeli army, the state terrorism of Israel!
A clear condemnation of the cruel aggression of Israel against the Palestinian people, which nothing can justify!
An end to the aggression and the inhumane blockade imposed on the population of the Gaza Strip!
Urgent humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian population!
The withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Palestinian territories!
Respect for international law and the UN resolutions by Israel, the end of the occupation, the settlements, the segregation wall, the assassinations, the detentions, the exploitation and the innumerable humiliations that are inflicted on the Palestinian people!
A just peace, which is only possible by respecting the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign state, with the 1967 borders and its capital in East Jerusalem!
In Palestine there is a coloniser and a colonised, an aggressor and a victim, an oppressor and an oppressed, an exploiter and an exploited.
Israel cannot continue with impunity!
in writing. - The reaction to the conflict in Gaza has to be more balanced than it currently is.
No excessive violence can be excused, yet we have to look deeper into the origins of the conflict.
Negotiations with Hamas as it is are not possible.
A terrorist grouping which is cynically using its own people as a shield against attacks is not interested in negotiating a true peace.
Furthermore, we need to take into account that Hamas has assumed an important role in the chain of terrorist movements which lead to Hezbollah and the Tehran terrorist regime.
So Hamas has to be seen as part of wider efforts to destroy the fragile stability in the Middle East and substitute this with fundamentalist extremist regimes that allow in principle no right of existence for Israel.
Indeed, we need to understand that the question of Israel's security is also linked to the EU's security.
The EU must exercise its authority to address first and foremost the roots of the conflict.
To avoid further killing of Arabs and Israelis, the Arab partners have to recognise unconditionally Israel's right to existence and contribute to stopping the infiltration of extremist movements and even more deadly weapons to this region.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, it is an incontrovertible fact that the civilian population in Gaza and southern Israel have been deprived of the right to an existence worthy of human beings.
One news agency told a story of two children who were about to cross the road in Gaza.
They did not look right or left to see if anything was coming - they looked up because they were afraid of what might come down from the sky.
There are clearly two guilty parties when it comes to Gaza's massive humanitarian crisis.
The irresponsible action of Hamas in the Palestinian territories, the cowardly way in which it hides among the civilian population, and the provocation it engenders with its rocket attacks are all indications of the unsustainability of the Palestinian government.
Israel's disproportionate attack on the already frail and desperate Palestinian enclave is another indication of its indifference to international humanitarian obligations.
We must call for an end to this madness in the shape of an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
As a first step, Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, where an improvement to living conditions would also constitute one of the paths to peace in the long term.
The Middle East Quartet needs to make a move in the right direction, with the new US administration showing the way.
Egypt has a special responsibility, because of matters to do with borders, and its role as mediator with the Union has given us hope.
World history shows that the quest for peace pays off in the end.
We cannot give in, adapt or become accustomed to the notion of an unresolved conflict, because there is no such thing.
According to Nobel Peace Prize Winner Martti Ahtisaari, peace is a matter of will.
The international community may try to encourage and foster this will, but only the parties concerned can produce it, and lasting peace.
Commissioner, could you take this message from Europe: 'People of the Holy Land, show that you want peace.'
in writing. - There is something disturbing about a world apparently helpless to save innocent children from being blown apart in war.
Despite all the words, there has been no let-up in the bombardment of Gaza, which has, so far, resulted in the deaths of 139 children and injury to 1 271.
Sadly, these shocking numbers will increase.
Hamas rocket attacks on Israel have provoked the response it desired - counter-attacks and the loss of civilian life and a further entrenchment of positions.
I deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields.
This has to stop.
I do not apportion blame - there is wrong on both sides, but I do stress the need for an immediate and effective ceasefire.
It is vital to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance and aid to Gaza without delay.
Would that humanity could only see the futility of such wars.
Every image of the dead in Gaza inflames people across the Arab world, and I am worried that the essential tenet of the Middle East peace process is slipping away: the so-called two-state solution, an independent Palestinian state coexisting in peace with Israel.
It is incumbent on the international community to redouble its efforts to find a solution.
in writing. - (FI) We are all now witnessing the wholesale slaughter of civilians by Israeli soldiers in Gaza.
We, or more precisely many Members on the right, are closing our eyes to what is happening.
It could not happen without the political right-wing elite in the United States of America and the EU closing their eyes.
The eye-closers are also the ones arming the killers of civilians.
It is time we raised the matter of severing diplomatic relations with the perpetrators of genocide and the ethnic cleansers.
in writing. - (HU) The situation in the Middle East fills me with anxiety.
What will it take to have peace?
How many civilian casualties will it take before there can be a true ceasefire? In Bosnia-Herzegovina it took at least 10 000 for peace negotiations to begin, for peacekeepers to arrive on site and for disarmament to begin.
A few days ago we commemorated the destruction of Nagyenyed (Aiud).
160 years ago, several thousand innocent civilians, including women and children, were massacred in this Transylvanian city and its environs.
Since that time it has not been possible to remember these victims together with the majority population.
There may come a time when Israelis and Palestinians not only remember each other's victims together, but join forces to build a lasting peace and future.
Until then, the task of the European Union is to serve as a responsible example.
There is a lot for us to do in building peace within Europe, too.
We need cooperation between majorities and minorities on an equal footing.
At the very least, we need to join together to remember the victims.
There is still a lot to be done in the EU in the area of respect for individual and minority rights.
in writing. - (PL) During January's plenary session, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the conflict in the Gaza Strip.
Both sides in the conflict were urged to implement an immediate and lasting ceasefire and to halt military activities (Israeli's military action and Hamas' rockets), which had for some time prevented aid and humanitarian assistance from getting through to the citizens of the territory where the conflict was being played out.
It has already cost thousands of victims, with civilians, including women and children who have been suffering for almost three weeks.
There is a shortage of basic necessities such as drinking water and food.
UN facilities have been attacked.
The resolution calls for observance of international law, which would resolve the existing conflict.
Israel is our friend, and is entitled to defend itself as a state, but it must be firmly stated and underlined that in this case the means it has used are highly disproportionate.
Israel needs to talk with Hamas, to negotiate, because the previous methods have not worked.
The European Union also faces a difficult task: it needs to find mechanisms which will lead to dialogue and understanding between the parties which will permanently end the conflict as soon as possible.

Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Dumitriu, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries - C6-0313/2008 -.
I am pleased that we have this opportunity to debate in a plenary session an issue which is important not only for the Community's agricultural sector, but also for the European economy's competitiveness as a whole.
At a time when the economies of our countries are suffering as a result of the global crisis and when increasing the demand for agricultural products is an imperative, amending Regulation No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries offers us additional leverage to support agricultural producers and, by extension, the EU economy.
European Council Regulation No 3/2008, which combines in a single text regulations 2702/1999 and 2826/2000, has accommodated the European Commission's new political approaches on simplifying legislation, while also achieving the objective of facilitating administrative procedures within the European institutions.
Based on this regulation, the Community can take information provision measures for a certain number of agricultural products on the internal market and on the markets of third countries, while also preserving the specific nature of the measures, according to the market in which they are implemented.
This policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, nutritional value and food safety standards, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries.
It also helps open up new market outlets and has a multiplier effect for national and private sector initiatives.
The amendments initiated by the European Commission are aimed at allowing interested Member States to devise a relevant programme where the organisations involved in drawing up proposals do not wish to present programmes to be implemented in third countries.
As a result of this, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and also seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures.
The draft report we are discussing proposes certain additions and adaptations to the Commission proposal, which are necessary in order to clarify and supplement the logic of the regulation.
First of all, we are proposing to introduce consultations with professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States, which are involved in the process of devising information programmes for agricultural products, both on the internal market and in third countries.
In view of their expertise and the important role these associations and organisations also play in guaranteeing and controlling quality, it is absolutely paramount that they are consulted.
At the same time, we support these programmes being drawn up based on an assessment of the need for them and their timeliness, providing us with the assurance that the funds are being spent effectively in programmes which meet the objective of helping promote Community products.
We are also proposing to extend the areas where international organisations can be assigned the implementation of information programmes for third countries.
Promotion and publicity measures are also relevant to the wine sector, both on the EU internal market and in third countries.
As is the case with the olive oil and table olive sector, international bodies exist in the wine sector, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which can ensure the implementation in third countries of programmes proposed by Member States, thereby disseminating information about the characteristics and advantages of wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication.
Another amendment which we are proposing to you is aimed at increasing the European Union's cofinancing percentage from 60% to 70% at a time when it is increasingly more difficult for small producers to gain access to financing due to the financial crisis.
Without any financial support, they risk going bankrupt as they do not have the leverage to promote their products and are facing a drop in market demand.
The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole.
Attaining this goal will help us overcome these difficult times we are going through.
The quality of the European Union's agricultural and food products is an advantage which we need to utilise in order to guarantee the European economy's competitiveness and higher incomes for producers.
I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely deep economic recession.
The measures being proposed will obviously not resolve all the problems linked to marketing and promoting the Community's agricultural and food products.
Simplifying the red tape involved with registering traditional products, introducing a 'Made in the European Union' label and solving the problem of products imported from third countries of lower quality and safety standards are just some of the areas which we need to consider in order to boost the market share for Community products.
Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments and questions.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, and the members of the Agriculture Committee, for an excellent report on the Commission proposal on information and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal and external markets.
I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report.
I think we all agree that the promotion of European agricultural products is of huge importance, both internally and externally.
I am convinced that trade in agricultural products will continue to grow in the future - even if we have to admit that we face a setback at the present time owing to the economic crisis.
However, there will be huge opportunities for our European products in third-country markets, and our promotion campaign should help European producers explore those new markets.
Before going into the content of the report, I would like to put it into perspective.
In 2008, the Commission adopted 42 programmes on the internal market and on third countries, representing a budget of EUR 128 million over three years.
According to the rules, half of that amount was then to be financed by the Community.
The aim of the Commission proposal is to make it possible for Member States to launch programmes cofinanced by the European Union in third countries - as described by the rapporteur - because today this possibility only exists for the internal market.
It should also be possible for those programmes to be implemented by international organisations.
The three most important amendments from the rapporteur and his colleagues are as follows: firstly, to make it compulsory for Member States to consult trade associations about the proposed programmes; secondly, to specify that implementation by international organisations is not only a possibility reserved for the International Olive Oil Council, but a general possibility, for example - as mentioned here today - also in the wine sector; and, on the budget side, to increase the cofinancing rate.
With regard to those amendments, I would emphasise that Member States do, in fact, already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers.
I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis.
My mentioning of the International Olive Oil Council is only meant as an example, because of the discussions that have recently taken place on the whole olive oil sector.
It certainly does not exclude other international organisations, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.
Regarding the funding of the budget, there is, of course, ongoing discussion on the level of cofinancing by the Community, but we discussed this issue when merging the two regulations dealing with promotion and information in 2008, so I do not think we should re-open the discussion on this issue.
Could I just take the opportunity to say that, when we agreed the wine reform, we did recognise the importance of promoting our products on third-country markets.
Therefore, in the interests of spending the budget for wine in a smarter and more intelligent way, we proposed the earmarking of EUR 120 million each year for the promotion of our wine products on third country markets as a special budget line.
However, since Member States - and especially the new Member States - did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that, if it was not spent, then it was lost, we included the EUR 120 million in the national envelopes, so that Member States can decide for themselves.
In any case, this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products.
I look forward to the discussion here today.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, for his objective report which reflects the real needs of this Community sector in terms of promoting European producers.
The report contains measures which will help open up new markets and make our farmers' agricultural production profitable.
This policy meets the actual needs of Member States wishing to promote their agricultural production, both among the Community's consumers and among those in third countries.
It provides an excellent opportunity for the emphasis to be placed on quality, nutritional value, production methods and the safety of the food produced.
I support the rapporteur's proposal offering the opportunity to interested countries to put forward information programmes for third countries if the latter do not have this facility.
This amendment will allow European countries to extend the practical scope of the measures envisaged by these programmes and to seek assistance from international organisations in implementing them.
I believe that during the process of devising these programmes, consideration should be given to the important role played by the associations and industry organisations in the individual countries, which have an objective view of what is happening in the individual industries.
We must note the importance of certain international bodies in promoting the specific characteristics and advantages of food products typical of particular EU regions.
I support the rapporteur's proposal for increasing the percentage rate for the Community's financial participation so that additional assistance can be provided to the projects selected by Member States.
I urge you to support Mr Dumitriu's report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I sincerely congratulate Mr Dumitriu on a good report - a continuation of the reports which were drawn up earlier, in which we talked about promotion and sums of money allocated to promotion of the European Union in third countries.
Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries play an enormous role in creating a positive image of the 'Made in Europe' brand.
I have been stressing this for a long time, and for several years I have been active in efforts to simplify the entire information provision and promotion system.
In my speeches I have repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting the 'Made in Europe' brand in third-country markets.
This is especially legitimate in the formal and legal conditions of today.
In accordance with the Declaration of the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, the use of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect will be eliminated in 2013.
In view of the complicated nature of organising promotional campaigns in third-country markets and the higher costs of such measures at a significant distance, particularly in Asia or America, the mechanism for supporting promotional activities did not attract much interest from trade organisations.
The proposal of the European Commission allows for stimulation of their activity.
Promotional programmes carried out by Member States offer the opportunity for entities to work together, where they have not managed to run and finance these activities on their own.
Nevertheless, efforts to increase the percentage share of the Community in financing this type of project should be continued.
I will mention as an example the United States of America, where several times more is spent on promotional activities than all the money allocated to wine and to activities in the area of other promotional products in the entire European Union.
In the face of liberalisation of the commercial flow of agricultural products, an instrument to support the promotion of Community production in third-country markets might be the only tool available which accords with the guidelines of the Agriculture Framework Agreement in the WTO Doha Development Agenda Round.
Promotion of the 'Made in Europe' brand is the chance to maintain competitiveness and, on a longer time-scale, even to strengthen the attractiveness of European agricultural and food products and to extend their market.
I would like to thank the Commission for these measures, which we have repeatedly spoken of in Parliament, and which have been included, and especially for the reduction in contributions from trade organisations from 20% to 10% and for increasing the funds available for promotional activity.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with you that advertising is important.
Yet advertising comes about not only as a result of professional offensives but also of occurrences in the region from which the foodstuffs originate.
When the world associates us with BSE, when we have turned our heraldic animal mad, or when, as now, countries are issuing product recalls because of the dioxin problem - which, of course, is also going around the world - and when millions of slaughtered sick cattle are shown on television news around the world, this is also a kind of advertising: negative advertising.
We must be careful to avoid contradiction here.
On the one hand, there is our talk of good products but, on the other, there are the negative reports - but we are working on this, as we have just seen with the debate and what we have concluded.
If we wish to advertise externally - yes, that is right, we have good reason to do so, as we have good products - I do not want it to be generalised advertising, but advertising showing European diversity.
As you know, we have the situation in Germany where the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled against a kind of compulsory advertising with a compulsory levy.
It pointed out that advertising that does not differentiate between the individual qualities does not increase sales, and that instead, it is important that the individual producers be able to advertise for their specific products.
In addition, it is increasingly important - not only within Europe but also externally - to describe not only the quality of the end product but also the quality of the process.
What is the situation with regard to animal protection, to the environment, to the ingredients, to the structure of the farming, to fair trade?
These are all criteria that do not necessarily affect the quality of the end product, but are becoming increasingly important to consumers.
We must incorporate this into our advertising too, therefore, and must see that Europe's reputation in the world is further enhanced as a result.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to bear in mind that it is important to improve the conditions and support for information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products, both in the European Union and in third countries, broadening the scope of the proposals that the European Commission has presented.
We therefore support the proposals of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, namely those aimed at greater intervention and strengthening the role of trade associations and organisations operating in the sector, in view of their expertise and the important part they also play in ensuring quality control, including the associations and organisations of the Member State that draws up the programme, as well as increasing the percentage of the Community's financial participation.
It is important that there is additional aid, especially for projects selected by the Member States.
Likewise, we believe that promotion and advertising actions in third countries should be able to benefit other important products in addition to olive oil and olives, with emphasis on wines with designations of origin or protected geographical indications.
In this respect, I will also mention here the important role of farmers' associations, with emphasis on cooperative wine cellars and other associations of small and medium-sized farmers, whose existence is fundamental in ensuring the flow of the produce of farmers who, on their own, would not be able to survive.
Once again, I would call for there to be enhanced support for these farmers' organisations to be able to completely fulfil their role in upholding family farming and promoting the high-quality agricultural products they produce, which are essential in guaranteeing a healthy diet for the population of our countries.
We will therefore vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is a significant exporter of many agricultural products, but the future of EU agriculture will be determined by consumption in the internal market.
Stimulation of this may bring benefits to farmers, consumers and whole economies.
In many Member States, the consumption of food products essential for good health is not high, and its growth, by means of good information and promotion, is most desirable.
However, it is important that EU farmers benefit from the programmes under discussion and, in particular, small and medium-sized farms, which comprise 95% of all farms.
These programmes should enrich consumers' knowledge of healthy eating and, at the same time, leave the choice to them.
This is why it is worth taking the following steps: organising consultations with specialists in the field of healthy diet and training salespeople, who should also be consumer advisors in matters of healthy diet.
Good presentation of information about the health benefits of the products being promoted, and about the way the foods are produced, is essential.
Information on food labels is insufficient.
This programme may be threatened by the promotion of food mass-produced by large food corporations, which can prepare effective programmes and which have the best specialists at their disposal.
Except will this not then compromise the promotion of high quality foods?
Legibility of the expiry date on products is also very important, as is a rise in consumer awareness of the significance of all the information which is to be found on product labels.
(RO) I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague for all the hard work he has put in as rapporteur in terms of simplifying EU legislation to reduce the administrative burden, something we very much need to do.
The information provision measures taken by the European Union are a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries, especially as regards quality and nutritional value, as well as food safety and safe production methods.
As quality rapporteur, I greatly cherish this competitive edge that our European products have.
This legislative amendment will offer interested Member States the possibility to propose information programmes, including when there are no programmes put forward for third countries.
As a result of this amendment, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures.
The percentage rate of the European Union's financial participation needs to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.
I support the idea that the organisation tasked with implementing the selected programme should be an international organisation, especially where the programme is aiming to promote the olive oil and table olive sector, not to mention the sector for wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication in third countries.
At the same time, we must bear in mind the important role which professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States have in devising information programmes for agricultural products.
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again, and especially Commissioner Vassiliou, because she has accepted all the proposals we have made within the report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, above all during this parliamentary term, we have witnessed a steady decline in direct support for our farmers and in the rules that used to protect our industry from cheap imports from outside the EU, in order to free up the resources needed to meet the new environmental, economic and social challenges of this millennium and to comply with international trade agreements.
As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, most importantly, as a representative of a country that has earned worldwide recognition and respect for the quality of its agricultural produce - I am thinking of olive oil, wine and cheeses - I cannot help but approve of any action whatsoever that the Commission may propose to safeguard high quality European produce and to promote, where possible, the marketing of this produce both on the internal market and abroad.
This information programme is, in fact, particularly significant, since it is to make clear to European and other consumers that our produce is not in competition with that, which may be cheaper, from other countries, but rather that it represents an alternative that focuses on quality and on a production model that respects the environment and social and animal welfare standards which, in turn, naturally benefits human health.
The legislation that we vote on in this House every day can come at a price, above all for our producers.
That is why we must offer them all the help we can, so that the richness and quality of our produce is not lost and does not become ironed out in an ever-more homogeneous global market.
For this reason, I support the rapporteur's amendments, which are aimed at increasing Commission cofinancing, adding to the activities that can be funded and, most importantly, increasing participation in producers' associations, which are best-placed to defend the qualitative features of their produce to ever-more exacting consumers.
(RO) Today we are discussing a report that is extremely important for European agriculture.
As the rapporteur himself has emphasised, the quality and safety of European products provide a competitive edge which has not been sufficiently utilised yet.
Measures aimed at providing information about and promoting these products, their quality and the food safety standards they comply with may trigger a chain reaction by boosting demand, increasing farmers' production and profits and creating new jobs, which also implicitly means economic growth.
These measures must be directed equally at consumers in the internal market and those in third countries.
Let us not forget the competition we are facing on the internal market from producers from other countries, offering products which are sometimes cheaper, but where, very often, the quality and safety standards are much lower.
Consumers need to recognise Community products and know why they are healthier than others.
Last but not least, they must know that buying these products supports European farmers and agri-food producers and, therefore, the European economy.
I particularly appreciate the initiative from the rapporteur on recognising the important role which professional associations and organisations play because, in most cases, they have the expertise which the country's institutions do not have.
They are also much more familiar with the real situation on the market and its requirements.
At the same time, I think that the proposal to increase the cofinancing percentage is an absolute necessity in the current credit crisis.
I strongly believe that this will increase the rate of use of these funds.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, on all his hard work and his proposals, a view which I believe all my fellow Members share.
(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu.
The agricultural sector is important for the Member States' economies because it provides food for the population, agricultural products for export, not to mention a large number of jobs.
The European Union must be able to provide sufficient quantities of food for its population at affordable prices.
It is obvious that in a competitive market, information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries are becoming increasingly important.
Professional associations or organisations must be consulted when it comes to drawing up the programmes for promoting agricultural products.
I believe that this regulation will encourage European farmers to promote their agricultural products.
Romania has a huge number of agri-food products which we do not, unfortunately, come across on European markets, even though many of them are environmentally friendly.
A campaign to promote these products will benefit both European consumers and Romanian agricultural producers.
Particularly at times of economic crisis, the agricultural sector obviously remains one of the sectors which must be given special attention, along with adequate programmes and funding.
In a crisis situation, Member States must focus greater attention when setting their priorities.
This is why I believe that agriculture must remain an area which is supported because it is important for the European economy.
(RO) I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on all his hard work on this report, which raises a very important issue.
There is a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, both among European Community consumers and those in other countries.
I would like to highlight two proposals mentioned in this report.
A request is being made for the percentage of the European Community's financial participation to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.
The second paragraph of this amendment seeks a financial participation of 70% from the European Community for measures to promote fruit and vegetables specifically for children in schools.
I feel that these amendments are appropriate and I hope that this initiative will be supported by as many MEPs as possible.
(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for all his hard work and for his contribution to expanding the area of application of the programmes for providing information about and promoting agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries.
One of the most important amendments being put forward by this report is the 10% increase both in European cofinancing for programmes promoting European agricultural products and in the budget allocations for promoting the consumption of dairy products, fruit and vegetables in schools.
On the one hand, Europe will benefit from a larger number of agricultural products being promoted more actively while, on the other, the biggest beneficiaries of the Community's aid will be children and pupils.
I think that the measures which have been proposed are extremely important as, now more than ever, we need investment in the areas which are developing rapidly and can lead to economic recovery.
Agriculture is one such area and the European Union can make a significant contribution to promoting it.
Mr President, the major food manufacturers around the globe spend billions promoting themselves - maybe using EU-produced food, but concentrating not on its origin but on their own brands.
We have celebrity TV chefs promoting their particular version of food production, with access to the airwaves and budgets of millions.
And here we are talking about a relatively small amount of money to promote all of Europe's food, both throughout the world and internally.
It is a big ask!
It is a very good report, which I fully support, and I endorse the comments of our Commissioner here today.
I am particularly interested in the idea that we need to promote outside our borders, and I would agree wholeheartedly with that, but we also have to be realistic about how we are going to compete, and whether we are competitive on a global market.
Perhaps the Commissioner would take that up in her responses.
The question of our standards has got to be acknowledged and recognised.
Is that being acknowledged and recognised at the WTO?
Mr President, I very strongly support promotion of our high-quality food.
In today's difficult market, the quality product is the best refuge, but it does need fulsome promotion.
60% cofinancing would be good if it can be obtained, and I regret that the Commissioner was unable to be as forthcoming as we hoped she would be in that regard.
In respect of my own region, I would very emphatically call upon the regional government - not one blessed with much initiative or with funds given how much it wastes on its top-heavy administration and needless cross-border bodies - to exert itself to draw down this EU funding, and thereby give our excellent local produce the best chance in the marketplace.
Along with what I hope will be 70% support from Europe to promote food and vegetables to our schools, I trust this opportunity will not be lost by a lackadaisical local department.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for the recent approval of 50% funding for An Bord Bia's proposal on information provision for meat in Asia over the next three years, which is much appreciated.
While I am very supportive of this proposal, could I be allowed two commercial caveats.
Firstly, some countries, such as Ireland, may be unlikely to draw up information programmes if the trade does not show an interest.
Secondly, while the proposed increase in funding to 60%, and to 70% for fruit and vegetable promotion would be very welcome in the current economic environment, realistically, the incentive to expand generic promotion may be limited as contributors and non-contributors alike will benefit from the programmes.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
(RO) I wish to express my support for the report presented by Mr Dumitriu on the information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market.
I believe that we need to increase the percentage rate of the European Community's financial participation in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States.
In particular, it is vital to increase the European Community's financial contribution to 70% of the real cost of the new programme for promoting fruit and vegetables specifically for children in the European Union's schools.
This measure will make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the programme for promoting fruit and vegetables in schools, which is an effort that must be made for the benefit of our children's health.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report.
Commissioner, I would like to endorse what you said.
I believe the future of European agriculture policy is very much with the market.
We have got to go out there and promote our high-quality products.
You mentioned the wine reform - previously, we were taking a lot of low-quality wine out of the market, buying it into intervention and then making it into biofuel, which was absolutely the wrong way to go.
What we should be doing is promoting quality food.
We have got a great diversity of wines, cheeses, meats, olive oil, fruits, vegetables - you name it.
Europe is rich in all these and we must go out and market them in the future.
I think, as we move beyond the Health Check into the new agriculture policy in 2013 and beyond, we have got to make sure that we use more money to promote our products and to link into the marketplace, because that is where the future lies.
As one last comment, can I say to the Commissioner that perhaps he should go to America and convince President Obama that Roquefort cheese is extremely good and that perhaps he can reduce the tariff that President Bush put on it before he left office.
(PL) Mr President, European and third-country consumers receive too little information about the quality and standards of European food.
The requirements which we place on European producers are exceptionally high.
Consumers should be aware of this, because it will affect their decisions concerning the choice of suitable products.
I am for promotion and information, although I more often speak of information as a more objective form of message.
We must also have specific requirements and standards concerning the quality of information and the method of promotion.
Finally, I am in favour of the EU and also national budgets supporting information provision and promotion programmes in the field of food.
At a time of crisis, it is important to have promotion and information which will counteract the fall in demand and consumption, including food consumption.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, my thanks for all the contributions.
It is great to hear such enthusiasm and interest in this important issue.
I think that all the comments here are, to a certain extent, very much in line with the Commission's view on the proposal.
I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the questions or issues raised here.
First of all on the financing - this has been raised by quite a few of you - to increase the cofinancing rate.
I think, though, that we have to be very cautious and careful when we try to monitor the benefit of the Community financing because I fear that if we increase the cofinancing, the bottom line will be that there will be less promotion.
That would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal.
Quality has been mentioned quite a few times today and I agree with you.
I think we have a golden opportunity to discuss this quality issue that is also linked to how we promote our products in the Third World, how we explain to consumers what they get when they buy European.
Last October, we presented a Green Paper on quality and we have had lots of contributions; there are more than 1 000 contributions on the website from all over Europe.
We are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in May.
We should take this opportunity when the discussion takes place here in Parliament on communication to make a link - how do we improve our possibilities to make it visible and make it understandable.
Here the labelling issue, which is both difficult and important, comes into the discussions, so I am looking forward to having a discussion with you on this issue in the autumn.
Finally, regarding the school fruit scheme which has been raised here today - it is not part of the proposal, but just to keep you updated - we introduced a school fruit scheme with a cofinancing rate of 70% to increase the awareness of young people and to take the opportunity to underline the importance of good eating habits among school children.
Once again, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, for a very good report.
I think it is very well mirrored here today by the dynamic discussion that we have had.
I wish to apologise if I run over my allotted two minutes by a few seconds.
Thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report.
I am confident that our remaining fellow Members will consider that the new regulations being proposed are appropriate and that we will vote in favour of them.
I would like to advise fellow Members that I will support their suggestions, especially those aimed at promoting European diversity, introducing European quality labelling and more consistent financial support from the Community.
I have been asked: why wine, along with olive oil among the international organisations which can implement promotion projects?
I would like to respond with another question: why olive oil then?
My response is positive on both counts.
They are highly successful export products from European Union Member States.
They have powerful, experienced international organisations which have already demonstrated their ability to manage complex programmes.
Indeed, the report's provisions do not exclude other areas.
As regards the second question about the 70% rate for cofinancing, the initial percentage rate was 60% and I felt that, in the current economic climate, it was necessary to increase it.
As experience from the uptake of European funds has shown so far, one of the biggest problems remains how to obtain cofinancing, especially at the moment when we are faced, on top of this, with a credit crisis.
This is why this rate needs to be increased, otherwise we risk ending up with the funds not being used.
Mrs Fischer Boel, I would like to thank you for the importance you have given to this report, in particular for the views you have expressed.
Although this is a consultation report, I hope and I would like these amendments to be included in the Commission's new proposal.
To finally sum up, there are two reasons why this report is necessary.
Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek assistance from the international organisations in implementing these measures.
It assigns a greater role to professional organisations and associations in the process of drawing up and implementing product information and promotion programmes.
Last but not least, it is part of the logic of the proposals for adapting European legislation in order to make the use of European funds more accessible by increasing the cofinancing percentage rate during a time when it is extremely difficult to gain access to credit.
As a further recommendation, I would also like to mention that the report was adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Committee for the support they provided.
I would personally like to thank Neil Parish for the support he gave me and, last but not least, Lutz Goepel for the trust he placed in me when he assigned me this report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place later today.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 February 2009.
Applied research relating to the common fisheries policy (short presentation)
The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on applied research relating to the common fisheries policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reconciling the correct preservation of ecosystems with sustainable exploitation of marine resources, preventing and controlling the impact of human activity on the environment, improving knowledge and technological development and innovation are tasks that cannot be tackled if we do not have the support of the European scientific community.
Fisheries research is also vital when drawing up recommendations and providing scientific advice to legislators.
Greater investment in research and development, and in the collection and processing of reliable data, would result in a more solid and sustainable Common Fisheries Policy.
However, although the phrase that I heard from the mouth of a scientist ('Not money, but human resources are the problem') paints a good picture of the situation, I will not be the one to say that research in fisheries has plenty of financial resources.
Instead, I will say that we have a dual problem.
Firstly, Commissioner, the amounts laid down in the Seventh Framework Programme for marine research, which should have been a cross-cutting issue, seem to be insufficient for the integrated approach that is currently desired for this issue.
Moreover, Commissioner, scientists - and I assure you that I have talked to many of them in order to draw up this report, both before and during the process - have problems when submitting projects to the Seventh Framework Programme.
These problems can partly be attributed, on the one hand, to the different focus that is required for aquaculture, which is basically industrial in nature, and on the other hand, to research into fisheries and marine science, which is multidisciplinary in nature and more long term.
Up until the Seventh Framework Programme, both of these fields were covered by the same funds, and reported to the Fisheries Directorate-General, which enabled them to complement each other.
Currently it is the Research Directorate-General that is responsible, and the result is that it is becoming difficult for the scientific community to communicate the concerns and needs of the sector to those that draw up the guidelines for the calls for proposals.
In addition, within the scientific community there is a perception that the Directorate-General appears to have opted to prioritise basic research without making room for research focused on public policies.
I will give you an example: to enrich, from a scientific point of view, Community maritime strategy, or to investigate the relationship between fisheries and climate change.
To summarise, the objective of European Union maritime policy of achieving productive fisheries in a clean marine environment requires that the scientists that work in this field have access to horizontal funding mechanisms in the Seventh Framework Programme.
To conclude, I would like to mention the second problem: the worrying shortage of young scientists in fisheries research, which appears to be the result of professional courses that are not very attractive in comparison with other basic sciences.
It is vital that we establish interesting and rewarding university courses that offer good professional opportunities.
It also seems that we need to standardise the different research models applied in the various Member States in order to be able to better compare the results and facilitate the aggregation of data, and to increase cooperation between national research institutions.
Of course, I also think that better incorporation of the experience and expertise of fishers into the process of drawing up scientific opinions, on which political decisions as part of the CFP are to be based, is vital.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I appreciate being able to talk about my own area of responsibility.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's report on applied research relating to the common fisheries policy and would also like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Rosa Miguélez Ramos, and the Committee on Fisheries, for their excellent work.
The report comes at the right moment with the preparation of the joint call on marine and maritime research under way.
It also coincides with the work programme 2010 for FP7 and the launching of the Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, which includes a chapter on research.
The Commission agrees in principle with the main elements of the report.
We welcome the support expressed for the European strategy for marine and maritime research, where priorities are given to increasing capacity building, new infrastructure, new skills and education initiatives, developing integration across established marine and maritime research disciplines, promoting synergy between Member States and the Commission and new research governance.
The Commission acknowledges the importance of ensuring that a sufficient budget is allocated to fisheries and aquaculture research in FP7, while maintaining a good balance with the other research sectors, particularly in agriculture, forestry and biotechnology: Theme 2 - KBBE, and Theme 6 - environment.
The annual budget for FP7 will progressively increase during the last three years of the programme and both the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will certainly benefit from this increase.
The Commission will pursue its effort to support research in line with the report by giving more visibility to fisheries and aquaculture research in FP7, securing a good balance between research in support of policy and more basic research, reinforcing social science in the work programmes, promoting dissemination of results and encouraging more coordination between national research programmes.
Finally, the Commission will facilitate the integration of fisheries and aquaculture research in the broader context of its strategic research agenda, the European Research Area and the new European Union strategy for marine and maritime research.
Bearing in mind the initiatives I have just described, I feel that there is now a solid base upon which we can improve our fisheries and aquaculture sectors through innovative research within the framework programme.
They, in turn, will also benefit from improved cooperation and coordination of national research, through the different European Research Area initiatives and within the direction of the common fisheries policy.
If I can add a sentence of my own, I can guarantee to you that it is not more complicated than it was before, simply because the same people are working on it and the cooperation which we have with my colleague, Mr Borg, is really excellent.
I think that is how research should be done in the future.
We are cooperating across sectors and this is really bringing better results, which could hardly have been the case if this were done in a more sectoral way.
I honestly thank you for the great work you have done.
The item is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 February 2009.

Croatia: progress report 2008 (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 13:
Thank you, Mr President.
There have been a lot of discussions between the groups over the last few days, right down to the last minute in fact.
The following amendment now seems to me to be the one that has the broadest agreement in this House and also, according to direct information which I have received, was voted on with the agreement of both Croatia and Slovenia.
The amendment reads as follows in English:
'Recalls the informal agreement reached on 26 August 2007 by the Prime Ministers of Croatia and Slovenia on the submission of their border dispute to an international body; welcomes the readiness of Croatia and Slovenia to accept the mediation offer made by the Commission and takes the view that this mediation should be based on international law; in this context, looks forward to a rapid advancement of the accession negotiations;'.
Artistic studies in the European Union (short presentation)
The next item is the report by Mrs Badia i Cutchet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on artistic studies in the European Union.
Mr President, although artistic education is now a mandatory subject in almost all Member States, there are substantial differences in the way it is taught.
Historically, artistic studies were linked to education during the earlier years.
Today, however, the lifelong learning approach and the development of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have expanded the area traditionally devoted to art and culture, and have generated new forms of access and display for the sector.
The constant advance of ICTs has also favoured the promotion of a knowledge-based economy, in which intellectual capabilities and creativity occupy a pre-eminent place.
The motion for a resolution, which we will vote on tomorrow, is based on the idea that artistic education forms the basis for vocational training in the field of the arts and promotes creativity, as well as physical and intellectual development in that sphere; it considers artistic education to be an essential component of learning in childhood and adolescence and argues that teaching it in schools will lay the foundations for truly democratising access to culture.
In addition, it values training as a very important factor for the success of professionals in the artistic and creative sector, since artistic studies that focus on developing a career and profession require of the students, in addition to talent, a solid cultural basis that can only be acquired through multidisciplinary and systematic training.
This increases the opportunities for access to employment in the sector in so far as it provides a general education, a research methodology, entrepreneurial abilities and business knowledge, as well as skills in various areas of activity.
Also, in a very special way, it recognises the economic and employment potential of creative, cultural and artistic industries in the European Union, which make a greater contribution than other highly recognised industries such as both the chemicals and the foodstuffs industries.
What is more, we should not forget that schools and centres for art and design education help to create new artistic styles and movements and to open up different cultural worlds, which strengthens the European Union's image in the world.
The draft report considers that artistic education should be a compulsory element in syllabuses at all school levels and encourages the Member States to coordinate their policies with regard to artistic education at European Union level and to promote mobility of both students and teachers in this sector, paying increased attention to the recognition of qualifications among Member States.
We are also calling on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to define the role of artistic education as an essential pedagogical tool in enhancing the value of culture, to establish joint strategies for the promotion of artistic education policies and policies for training teachers specialising in this subject, and to recognise the important role played by artists and creativity in our society, as demonstrated by the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
Lastly, the report emphasises the importance of using the resources provided by new information technologies and the Internet as channels for modern teaching geared to contemporary practice when introducing the artistic dimension into school curricula, and recommends that a European portal for artistic and cultural education be developed jointly in order to safeguard the development and promotion of the European cultural model.
For all these reasons, I would ask for majority support for the report, which will send out a clear message of support to professionals, students and businesses in the creative and cultural sector.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank Mrs Badia i Cutchet for her own-initiative report on artistic studies in the European Union.
This issue is occupying an increasingly important place at European level.
In fact, we all agree that culture and the arts form a fundamental part of education.
They help to develop sensitivity and self-confidence, essential qualities not only for our role as citizens but also for the role of economic operator that is in each of us.
There can be no doubt about this.
Artistic education is a vector of well-being, creativity and social integration.
It is essential that it be promoted in Europe's education systems from as early an age as possible.
We share this vision and we are glad that your report refers to a number of significant initiatives taken at European Union level, such as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
The importance of the arts and artistic education in building a better society goes hand in hand with its impact on economic life.
According to recent estimates, the contribution of the cultural and creative industries to the creation of economic wealth is estimated at 2.6% of European GDP.
In addition, any economic activity can benefit from the arts and cultural education.
Innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones.
Today we must combine technology and design, whilst integrating the principles of sustainability and economic viability.
This combination requires a redefinition of the ways in which knowledge is transmitted and acquired.
These different issues are set out in the European Reference Framework document that defines key competences for lifelong learning in 2006.
In this framework, it is stated that artistic and cultural expression is essential to the development of creative competences, which are so useful in the context of working life.
The European Agenda for Culture has introduced new methods, particularly the structured dialogue with civil society and, recently, new open methods of cultural coordination.
The implementation of these methods has been made possible thanks to an initial three-year work plan, adopted by the Council on 21 May 2008, which defines five priority action areas.
In this framework, a working group made up of experts from the Member States was set up around the theme of synergies between culture and education.
This group will be drawing up recommendations to identify good practices at national level and will also make a number of recommendations to the Member States and the European institutions.
In addition, it will provide methods for assessing the progress achieved in the policy areas that fall under its mandate.
Finally, this group should make a valuable contribution to the European Forum for Culture scheduled to take place on 29 and 30 September 2009, in Brussels.
I have just been reading an answer from my fellow commissioner, Mr Figel.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 24 March 2009.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
The European Parliament report on artistic studies in the EU is part of the continuing efforts to develop intercultural dialogue and is vitally important in the context of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
Greater and more specific attention must undoubtedly be focused on artistic studies.
It is important that it is a compulsory part of the education programme and from the earliest age too, because it stimulates emotional and cultural development in the young generation.
Giving these studies a stronger practical purpose and including interactive teaching would result in a deeper understanding of national and European cultural values.
Providing greater mobility for students, teachers and professionals employed in this sector is the direct way to create an awareness of European identity and foster cultural and religious tolerance.
Member States must invest in creating better opportunities for informal and independent artistic studies and prevent a drop in the number of programmes in this area.
Their support for artists' professional life will increase the general interest in different forms of artistic studies.
Public-private partnerships in this area will help modernise the education programmes and encourage more active integration of new technologies in the teaching process.
The majority of resources for a coordinated European policy on artistic studies take the form of investments for boosting Europe's cultural influence globally, for creativity and, indirectly, for the EU's economy.

rapporteur. - (RO) Parliament reached an agreement with the Council and this agreement is supported by five political groups.
I am referring to the two reports which follow.
Thanks to the amendments submitted by two of our fellow Members - incidentally, the content of these amendments has already been included in the compromise agreed with the Council -, we must vote today on a number of articles.
Rules which I regard as incorrect have meant that the order of vote includes in some articles the text from the Committee on Transport and Tourism first and then the compromise text.
I would like to request for us to vote on the compromise text today as it is actually supported by the five political groups, so that the two regulations come into force by the end of this legislature.
- Thank you for your comments.
We will in fact get to where you would like to be by following the voting list and voting on the amendments.

Future of the car industry (vote)
- Before the final vote:
- (DE) Madam President, I refer to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure and thank you for having given me the floor.
I ask my fellow Members from the Federal Republic of Germany in particular for their indulgence of my having asked to speak now.
At the beginning of this vote, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen took the floor.
Mr Le Pen repeated in his leave to speak that the existence of the gas chambers in Auschwitz was a detail of world history.
With reference to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure, which describes how members of this House must behave here, I ask Parliament's Bureau to check if such a statement is permissible in a chamber of deputies, which is bound by a spirit of reconciliation and understanding and respect for the victims, especially of Hitler's Fascism.
I would be grateful if Parliament's Bureau could advise on the necessary measures.
(Applause)
- (FR) Please, show a little respect for the victims who died at Auschwitz and elsewhere.
We still have two minutes left.
Show a little respect.
All I wish to say is that I completely agree with Mr Schulz and that what we have heard today, in this House, is uncalled for.
(Applause)
- (FR) Mrs Wallis, I find it extremely regrettable that you have given the floor to Mr Daul and Mr Schulz, but not to me.
It is true that you testified in a report that you were the expert in interpreting the one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another Rules of Procedure.
Therefore, just to follow on from what Mr Schulz said, I should like to propose that we rename the Winston Churchill building, since in his 12 volumes of memoirs dedicated to the history of the Second World War, Winston Churchill wrote not one line on the history of the gas chambers.
White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules (debate)
- The next item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules -.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first may I thank the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sánchez Presedo on behalf of the socialists and Mrs Bowles on behalf of the liberals, who worked very successfully with me on the compromise text being tabled today as a report on the Commission's White Paper.
We have managed this time to achieve a very large, cross-group majority and a really viable compromise, which can also be used as a guideline for future work by the European Commission and later, during the law-making process, by Parliament and the Council.
We have made clear in this report - and rightly so - that, where competition rules are infringed, Parliament stands by the view that, according to the European tradition, it is primarily the task of the authorities - both the national competition authorities and the European competition authority - to take action and that this is not creating a second arm, as it were, on an equal footing with official action in the fight against cartels.
We have deliberately chosen a different path in Europe from the US, with which the situation is often compared.
There is political consensus in the House that we need a solution for so-called mass claims.
If the illegal conduct of individuals damages a very large number of persons who suffer comparatively minor losses, then a separate solution is needed for such proceedings, for which normal procedural law is simply not effective enough.
The creation of such an instrument is also part of providing access to law and further developing the internal market.
On this we are agreed.
There was also consensus that we do not want a litigation industry to develop in Europe as it has in America, with turnover of USD 240 billion, which is ultimately of no advantage to consumers and, as we all know from simply reading the relevant books, mainly profits American law firms.
None of this has much to do with the rule of law, nor do we want it to.
We agreed that the procedural torture instruments of the American system should not be adopted in Europe.
This applies in particular to the taking of evidence and costs.
That is a very important point.
We also agreed that we were basically of the opinion that, from a point of view of principle, legislation at European level can only be an opt-in solution and that an opt-out solution would only be permissible here where the Member States already have a similar solution and national constitutional law so allows.
An opt in is not allowed under every country's national constitutional law and it also contradicts the principle of the adult consumer.
As we insistently complain, the European Commission has completely forgotten to deal with the question of out-of-court settlements in its White Paper.
The Directorate-General on Competition and the Commission have gone straight for litigation.
However, as we have known for years from the debate in this House on legal policy, that is not always the ideal way forward and, as a rule, out-of-court settlement mechanisms are often much more suitable for resolving problems.
Moreover, parallel work by the Directorate-General on Consumer Protection on the same issue has progressed much further.
This Directorate-General used a broad margin for these alternative settlement instruments in its Green Paper, which is one consultation stage before this.
We are convinced that the European Commission urgently needs to rework this question.
One last point, which is also crucial: we do not want fragmentation of the law.
Now competition law is going off and creating such an instrument.
Consumer protection is coming along on the same issue.
We know that at some point something similar will be considered in relation to capital market law, environmental law and social law.
We consider it absolutely necessary for a horizontal approach to be considered as well and for us at least to support the procedural instruments which are more or less the same in all areas with a horizontal instrument.
That is also of decisive importance.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome, on behalf of the Commission, Mr Lehne's report, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and adopted as a sign of strong consensus across the political groups.
We are also pleased that this report strongly supports the white paper.
The Commission notes that the report agrees with the findings of this paper, that victims of European Community competition law infringements currently face considerable difficulties in claiming compensation for the harm suffered by them.
We agree that measures must be taken to ensure full compensation of those victims.
We also share the view that collective redress is crucial for consumers and small businesses in order to give them a realistic and efficient possibility to obtain compensation in cases of scattered damage.
The Commission also fully agrees with the ECON Committee report, that excessive or abusive litigation must be avoided.
To this end, therefore, collective redress mechanisms must include appropriate safeguards.
Finally, we fully agree that its approach to collective redress must be consistent and that compatibility must, therefore, be ensured between initiatives targeted at various areas, such as competition law or consumer protection laws.
At the same time, the Commission welcomes the acknowledgement that a consistent approach to collective redress does not necessarily mean that all areas would have to be dealt with in one single horizontal instrument.
The call for consistency must not unduly delay the development of measures identified as necessary for the full enforcement of the European Community competition law.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (RO) The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has formulated its position based on a certain reality: the negative effects resulting from the breach of antitrust legislation can be felt economically very often at the end of the commercial chain, affecting end consumers and small enterprises.
In this case, damages for the losses suffered are important but, at the same time, they are difficult to obtain, as many have been affected and small sums are involved.
As a result, we have requested a package of legislative and non-legislative measures to provide the tool which all European citizens affected by such a situation can use to defend their right to full, proper damages.
We support all measures designed to eliminate difficulties in achieving this objective: facilitating access to documents, reducing the costs of legal procedures and reversing the burden of proof.
We welcome the Commission's proposal to combine representative actions brought by qualified entities with collective actions, with explicit agreement expressed.
However, we consider that 'opt-out' collective actions must continue to be discussed, given the benefit they provide: a 'once and for all' settlement and less uncertainty.
Although the EU Treaty clearly prohibits cartels and other infringements of competition law, it is still difficult for affected consumers in the European Community to claim their rights to compensation.
In Romania, for example, a cartel set up in the cement industry was recently fined several million euro.
However, the current legislation in force does not oblige authorities with the powers to monitor competition to get involved in compensation for victims.
I would like to stress the need for these authorities to take into consideration the compensation paid or which should be paid when they calculate the fines imposed on companies which are found guilty of abuses, so as to prevent discrepancies between the harm caused and the punitive measures applied, and especially to ensure damages are paid to those affected by such practices.
This is why I welcome the Commission's intention to improve the methods for guaranteeing the rights of consumers affected by infringement of the law throughout Europe.
Parliament stated very clearly that there must not be any 'opt-out' system in Europe.
Therefore, the victims must be identified as quickly as possible at the time a complaint is made.
The 'opt-in' system guarantees that victims affected by the infringement of competition law will actually be compensated.
Parliament does not want anyone else, be it lawyers, trade associations or the Consumer Protection Office, to benefit as a result of private actions.
I also believe that Parliament is adding a new important element which the Commission's proposal has omitted.
Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are in many cases much more effective for victims who are entitled to compensation than judicial procedures.
I am referring to the fact that at the time when compensation is being sought, settlements must be initiated first of all outside the courts.
They are much less costly than private actions as consumers will be compensated for the losses suffered much more quickly.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Not only is this an excellent outcome, but also, given the difficult, complex and controversial nature of the issues in question, it is an exceptional one, which should give impetus to and solidly cement the new pillar of private actions, which is vital in making the policy of Community competence effective.
This is a new step in the direction of a more advanced and effective policy of responsibilities, which will be more respectful of the rights of victims and more effective in imposing liability on the infringer.
I would therefore like, firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who has had the principal responsibility for bringing this task to a successful conclusion.
The quality of his ideas, his open spirit and readiness to engage in dialogue, and his intelligence in extracting the best compromises have been vital in achieving this.
I would like to extend my congratulations to the draftsmen of opinions, the shadow rapporteurs and those who tabled amendments, who have made such a positive contribution to enriching the report.
The Commission's White Paper entitled 'Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules' is a response to a request made by the European Parliament in its resolution on the Green Paper, the content of which it accepts in large part.
This is the case when, among other aspects, it endorses the complementary nature of public and private legal actions, and positions itself in favour of group actions, although avoiding the excess of US class actions, thus facilitating the claiming of damages; when it proposes access to relevant information under judicial control, although avoiding a fishing expedition, and when it recognises and calls for the bringing of independent actions or follow-up actions and a voluntary compensation system.
The report stands up for codecision by the European Parliament in the establishment of the legal framework for the bringing of damages actions for breach of EC antitrust rules.
This position should not be understood as a denial of the policy of Community competence as a legal basis for the legislation, but as an upgrading of the requirements of the ordinary procedure in this sphere, to meet the higher values recognised in the Treaty.
When a regulation has a significant effect on a fundamental right, such as the right of citizens to effective legal protection - which forms part of the European system and that of the Member States - the democratic principle and respect for national legal traditions - which require that such matters may only be regulated by means of provisions at the legal level, or, in other words, with action by the direct representatives of the public - demands the legislative participation of the European Parliament.
It also establishes a horizontal, integrated approach for tackling the shared problems which the bringing of private legal actions within competition law may have with other realms, thus avoiding a fragmented, inconsistent approach.
Private legal actions may be brought by a public body and also by individual or group actions.
This second arrangement may be carried out directly by the victims or indirectly, through qualified entities, whether appointed in advance or designated ad hoc, such as consumer or business associations.
Where actions are brought by qualified entities, the group of victims must be defined in the submission of the application, but the identification of each one can be done later on, although it must be clearly established as soon as possible, avoiding unnecessary delays and complying with the existing legislation.
This solution is very important for cases of lower and fragmented damages.
The report raises in a balanced way the question of access to the information necessary for bringing follow-up actions.
The protection of business secrets should be safeguarded, as should the effectiveness of clemency programmes, for which guidelines are requested.
Conditions are set so that the decisions taken by an authority which is a member of the Community competition authorities network can become binding in another Member State and so that, with full compliance with the principle of liability, the burden of proof is reversed and it is presumed that fault or blame exist when the existence of a breach has been established.
It is also worth highlighting the acceptance of the 'passing-on' defence for indirect victims and a system that simplifies and reduces the costs of proceedings.
I would also like to emphasise the positive interaction between public and private actions, both in incentivising compensation for victims and in establishing the five-year period for the bringing of actions.
I would like to end by expressing my gratitude to the Commission for the dialogue that has been maintained throughout this procedure and by asking the Commissioner to submit without delay the initiatives required for its developments.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Lehne for his report and to confirm that my group will be supporting that report.
I would also like to say that I find it a little odd that we are having this debate late at night when we have a question on the same subject tabled for tomorrow morning.
It would have made a great deal of sense to have put both together.
However, in complimenting the report, let me say that my group's starting point will be 'doing justice' - doing justice for SMEs and consumers across the European Union, where they have to face inappropriate and anti-competitive action.
A few weeks ago my group organised a seminar at Parliament in Brussels, and I was very struck by certain of our visitors who were at the sharp end of such anti-competitive action, ironically in the cement industry.
What did they say?
Please, please, get on with this: we need something that will allow us to pursue these inappropriate operators in the European market.
We want a European solution, and we want it sooner rather than later, because, if we do not get it, my forecast and my warning is this: some of our Member States will develop systems that will lead to forum shopping as a result of free movement of judgements.
So, please - a European system as soon as possible.
- I shall make sure that your point concerning the agenda is communicated to the Conference of Presidents, which fixes the agenda - sometimes it makes mistakes.
Mr President, the internal market is the EU's absolute greatest contribution to freedom and prosperity in Europe.
Among other things, it requires effective antitrust legislation.
What we are now considering is the issue of damages actions for breach of antitrust rules.
There are good fundamental reasons for citizens and companies to be able to claim damages.
Mr Lehne's report indicates, to some extent unintentionally, the problems and the risks involved.
The white paper talks of a European legal culture, but this does not exist.
We should not create regulations based on wishful thinking.
The rapporteur intends us to avoid an 'Americanised' compensation culture.
This is also wishful thinking.
On the contrary, the risks of such a culture occurring are high.
The division of responsibility between the EU institutions and the Member States has been ignored.
There is no objective analysis of what is required by the subsidiarity principle.
The principle is quite simply not taken seriously.
There are also many other unclear points and points that are at risk of being completely arbitrary.
Paragraphs 7 and 11 together instil a sense of misgiving.
An obvious starting point must be damages actions on the basis of a breach of antitrust rules.
It requires the crime to have been established in court, after which res judicata would presumably have to apply, even in the context of an individual claim, so that judgments relating to a single case cannot be revisited.
Paragraphs 15 and 18 together allow the plaintiff to choose the legal system that is most favourable.
This creates legal uncertainty and will result in 'forum shopping', which will be a real threat.
The information asymmetry is to be reduced by forcing companies to provide information to the plaintiff.
This will result in the subjective handling of important business information, which can be misused.
There are far too many risks and points that are unclear at this stage.
The Chamber should therefore reject this report and request a more detailed analysis of the issue before we take a decision.
- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first a very big thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who has done a magnificent job and has found appropriate solutions to a very difficult question in agreement with the Members from the other groups.
I see from the debate that we are all agreed that we need a horizontal approach for all collective claims and I therefore ask the Commission not to table separate proposals by individual Directorates General for each separate area, but at best to give us a truly collective legal redress mechanism covering all areas for the European internal market and for European citizens and of course - as Mrs Wallis said - for European SMEs.
We are united in the thought that the interests of those damaged by a cartel must be effectively upheld and that we must subject the European economy to cartel control in accordance with the principle of the social market economy. Nor do we want any abuse of the various national regulations in the form of forum shopping.
However, this evening's debate has not afforded me very much information on the most effective way of achieving this, because I believe that the potential of collective claims is often overestimated.
That is why it is important to lay down again certain benchmarks against which we have to measure all collective claim procedures.
We must answer the question of whether additional legal protection for consumers or victims in mass claims, cross-border litigation and litigation which affects more than one Member State really is necessary.
We must allow for the Member States' procedural constraints - opt out, opt in and numerous other points - in the European procedure.
If this is simply not possible, as the Commission itself has already partially conceded, then we need the Member States' legal instruments on board and a common procedure with the Member States' parliaments in order to serve the interests of European consumers.
We definitely want to avoid collective claims in Europe along the lines of the US model.
We want to ensure that compensation is awarded, but only to those who actually sustained losses.
We want to advise as emphatically as possible against unjustified claims and we want to promote alternative settlement procedures.
- (SV) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Lehne for a constructive and thorough report, which addresses important issues within competition law and increases consumer protection.
The European Court of Justice grants individuals and companies the right to damages for breaches of the competition rules, but in spite of that fact the reality is that individuals who have suffered loss as a result of a breach of EC antitrust rules rarely receive compensation.
We must therefore create mechanisms that increase trust and make it easier for individuals to be able to assert their rights across borders.
We know that consumers and small businesses are frightened of instigating proceedings because of concern about long drawn-out processes and, in particular, high costs.
Changes in this regard will promote cross-border trade.
If we are to have a functioning internal market throughout the EU where people can rely on their case being examined in a legally certain manner and on receiving full compensation for the damages caused, in other words the loss, we must also find new mechanisms to facilitate group claims.
When we talk about group claims, the subject of the US and its experiences and extremes always comes up.
We must, of course, learn from this, but we should not allow ourselves to be intimidated.
Europe must have a European system, not an American one.
If we do nothing the situation will only get worse.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you all for very interesting contributions, especially the introductory exposé of Klaus-Heiner Lehne.
This was very interesting, and I now see why you are so consensual and working not only together in committee but also in plenary on these issues.
There is not much I can add, except perhaps on the legal bases.
Of course it depends on the objectives and the content of the action proposed, and I want to assure you, as a Commissioner - for another portfolio, perhaps, but I speak on behalf of the Commission - that, in principle, we seek very close cooperation with Parliament.
How to establish this with regard to a practical, concrete item or issue remains to be seen, but we will strive for close cooperation or as close cooperation with Parliament as is possible under the applicable legal basis.
On what you have said about fragmentation and a horizontal approach, I think the answer from the Commission - and it is very visible in the white paper - is a consistent, coherent approach, and I think that the European legal tradition and the roots of our legal culture are different from the oft-quoted American ones.
But I think that we can learn from the others and further build up our system.
On public enforcement and justice, of course, I think it is very important that we are not going towards lessening this enforcement, and, of course, Articles 81 and 82 are very important pillars of the EU single market and policies.
They are about justice, and damages actions are complementary to this law enforcement.
Last - but maybe not least - what was said about out-of-court settlements.
The Commission is in favour, but the precondition or the base for such an approach, which would be welcome, is an existing and functioning efficient litigation system on damages actions at the level of Member States.
So I think we need to not only encourage but help our Member States so that such issues and systems are running in the EU of 27.
Then I think we may also come to these points.
But, in principle, thank you very much for what was, for me, too, a very interesting debate, and all the best.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, first may I thank my honourable friends for their very helpful contributions.
I think that we all pulled together and achieved a good result.
However, I also want to say quite clearly to the Commission, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: from Parliament's point of view, there is no question of your tabling a bill that is probably already fit for nothing.
Absolutely no question.
We expect the Commission to take account of what we have decided today and for it to be included in the actual legislation proposed.
The horizontal approach is not only an important aspect on the basis of the arguments which I expounded earlier; the Commissioner personally also addressed the question of the legal basis.
With such an important project, an approach must be chosen which ultimately guarantees that Parliament is involved as a legislator on an equal footing.
If an approach based purely on competition law is chosen, that would not be the case under the Treaty of Nice currently in force.
This is also a very fundamental political argument in favour of why we consider a horizontal approach to be the right one.
I think the Commission should consider this very seriously.
Another decisive point in my opinion is that we still need something on the question of out-of-court settlements.
You spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the Directorate-General on Competition.
However, if one compares the Green Paper on consumer protection with the White Paper on competition, one does not necessarily get the impression that there is really any such convergence.
The most blatant example is the different treatment - or to be more exact the lack of treatment - of out-of-court settlement mechanisms in the White Paper.
There is still a series of other problems which we expect to be resolved.
I just want to refer briefly to the question of access to the European Commission's files.
It is possible in all criminal proceedings in which compensation is being claimed to inspect the public prosecutor's case files.
Why does this not apply to the European Commission?
It is beyond me.
The same applies to the question of fixing penalties: this also needs to be taken into account from the point of view that it must be possible to claim compensation in future.
Here too the Commission urgently needs to rework the text and table more specific texts and proposals than those included so far in the White Paper.
May I say quite clearly from Parliament's point of view, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: we expect more than what is contained in the White Paper and we also expect the Directorate-General on Competition as a whole to follow our suggestions, otherwise there will be resistance in this House.
- I should like to thank you all for your contributions on this important topic and also thank the Commissioner, the staff and the interpreters.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (ET) Parliament's report emphasises the usefulness of leniency programmes in exposing cartel agreements, and I am glad to be able to say here that a draft leniency programme is presently being discussed in the Estonian parliament.
This should become an important part of the struggle against cartels, which is important both for the better functioning of the common market and in order to protect consumer rights, because consumer prices may rise as much as 25% due to cartel agreements.
I do, however, believe that representative actions can also play an important role in the effective implementation of competition law and the improvement of consumer protection, and thus we must also devote attention to this, both at the Estonian and European Union levels.
Research has proven that representative actions would significantly improve consumers' willingness to stand up for their rights, and in countries where consumer activeness is low because of the fear of the complexity and cost of such undertakings, measures such as representative actions are of crucial importance.
Collective redress (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on collective redress.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, since the beginning of my mandate, redress has, as you know, been high on my list of priorities.
I believe that substantive rights show their strength only when they are backed by enforcement and effective redress for consumers.
More and more often, large numbers of consumers lose out as a result of the same or similar illegal practices by a trader and do not receive redress.
The Commission has been examining the problem that consumers face in obtaining redress for mass claims.
We have commissioned studies, discussed the issue with stakeholders, conducted surveys and an Internet consultation, and recently published a green paper to which we have received more than 170 responses.
Although the consultation officially ended on 1 March 2009, comments are still coming in and I can already tell you that, the more evidence we gather, the more our belief that there is a problem is confirmed.
This is why we need to find a solution in the interests of justice and a healthy European economy.
The green paper on consumer collective redress proposed various ways of tackling this problem.
A preliminary analysis of the replies received indicates that stakeholders recognise the unsatisfactory present situation on collective redress in the Member States.
There is consensus about the necessity of further action to achieve effective redress for consumers and thereby restore their confidence in the market.
Consumer organisations favour binding measures for a collective redress judicial scheme in all Member States in combination with other options, such as the extension of existing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to collective claims.
Business would favour ADR mechanisms.
In a few weeks' time, once we have properly analysed all the responses, we will publish the replies, together with a statement on the feedback we received, and before the summer we will outline the different ways of addressing the problem of mass claims.
This will not simply be a repetition of the four options in the green paper.
Our thinking is developing further in the light of the responses to the green paper consultation.
Based on the outcome of all the consultations, the Commission will carefully examine the economic and social impact on stakeholders, including the costs and benefits generated by the possible options.
On 29 May we will hold a hearing to share our preliminary conclusions with stakeholders.
Let me stress that, whatever route we take, we will not go down the path of the US experience.
Instead, we will follow our European legal cultures and take into account the existing experiences of Member States.
Once the options become clear, the European Parliament, Member States and stakeholders will be convinced, as I am, that not only is there a problem but also that an effective solution must, and can, be found at European level.
Why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated?
And I stress 'compensated'.
This is the very nature of redress that we are aspiring to.
Why should consumers give up their legitimate expectations of compensation, and why should society put up with the welfare and justice gap?
I am confident that we will find a solution that strikes the right balance between improving consumer access to redress and avoiding unfounded claims.
Effective redress will boost consumers' confidence in the internal market and in what Europe can do for them.
This is particularly important in the harsh reality of today's economic and financial crisis.
As you know, the coming months will be marked by many institutional changes, and this may influence the timing and the delivery of our work on collective redress.
Concerning the initiative taken by the Commission on damages actions for breach of the European anti-trust rules, I can assure you that the Commission shares Parliament's view that these two initiatives related to collective redress should be consistent.
Indeed, being consistent does not mean that different policy initiatives have to use the same tools to reach the same goals.
I can equally assure you that I remain personally committed to this issue and will continue to work on it until the end of my mandate with the same energy and vigour that I have devoted to it thus far, and of course with the kind help and support of Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it is a pleasure to welcome Commissioner Kuneva to the House once again.
Commissioner, I only need to use your own words about your energy and vigour in pursuing the interests of consumers, which, I think from our side of the House and, indeed, for all members of our committee, we have admired, and we encourage you very much to continue that work.
As far as the collective redress proposal is concerned, I think you are approaching it in exactly the right way.
We have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue.
It involves not just European-level measures but also very difficult issues about engagement with national law and regional law and, above all, as you indicated, the consumer has to be at the heart of it.
You have been really consistent in saying that consumer confidence in the internal market and cross-border trading is one of the fundamental issues that we have to raise, because otherwise consumers are not getting their rights of access and being able to use and exercise their choice across borders.
I think that remains at the heart of what you are discussing today.
Above all, I think the timing and complexity of solutions is important, because you have evoked a wide range of solutions here, but it is quite clear that solutions that may involve some new European-level judicial mechanisms will clearly take far longer and potentially be more controversial than picking up some of the alternative dispute resolution measures or also using the existing consumer cooperation measures that have been put in place.
I think all of us on this committee recall that, in fact, the enhanced cooperation on consumers was an aspect that was put through our committee in the last Parliament, and we would like to see that become more effective.
I think there is a vehicle there that can be used to give consumers the sort of redress that we are looking for, not just in collective claims but also in dealing with cross-border claims themselves much more effectively.
If we can get that sense of priority there and timing and speed to come up with the best solutions quickly, I think that is the way that I commend you to think about moving forward.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for taking up the Socialist Group in the European Parliament's initiative and addressing this matter, as this issue is important to citizens.
I have my mobile phone here.
I have heard from many young people that they have a lot of problems because, for one contract or another that they have completely unwittingly entered into - for ringtones for example - a sum of money is deducted each month for five, six, seven, eight months.
No one goes to court for the sake of EUR 5, but if a million citizens experience the same thing and an undertaking unduly pockets EUR 5 million, that is a case of unfair competition in relation to those competitors within the European Union that behave correctly.
For this reason, it is very important that we address this issue.
However, it is also important for the people, for the young people, for parents, who are confronted with this to be provided with legal instruments to truly strengthen their hand.
At a time when Europe is growing together, when people are shopping on the Internet, it is important that we establish these as cross-border instruments to enable them to really be used appropriately.
Therefore, in the opinion of my Group, it is precisely the group action provided for by such instruments that must clearly be examined in order to ascertain whether they can be used in the European Union.
However, as you have also said, Commissioner, we need to design these instruments in such a way as to prevent the extremes seen in the US, for example, from creeping in, and instead tailor them to our own legal system.
We must work on this and we wish to pursue this matter further in the coming months.
Commissioner, you know that we are on your side with regard to this matter.
When it comes to enforcing the rights of citizens, we Social Democrats are always involved.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.
I am pleased, Mrs Kuneva, that at the request of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats you have been instrumental in getting the proposal relating to collective redress from the DG Competition, which to start with planned to regulate this according to the practice in the US, to be developed using a horizontal approach and to actually treat everyone equally within the European Union - small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers, workers and entrepreneurs.
This is an important step forward, which we wish to support in a very constructive and positive manner.
We are aware that in many individual cases, of course, a Community claim for the enforcement of collective rights appears to be more successful than individual enforcement.
However, we remain convinced that the way of skimming off summary actions that protects the consumer the most is not collective redress, but public enforcement of such claims, for example by means of a skimming claim as in the German Law against unfair competition, because individual consumers will consider very carefully whether in fact to file a collective action with a lawyer for EUR 4.99 or whether it would actually be more helpful if, for example, these claims were continually monitored at public level by an ombudsman and enforced by appropriate means.
Thus, with regard to the question of how to link these two elements, I believe that we need to consider carefully how we can help consumers in the most effective way, as consumers often do not have the time to go to a lawyer, but instead want to find help quickly and easily.
The second point that I see as important - and here, too, your Directorate General has done a very good job - is that the most interesting element was a discussion in the Bavarian representation in Brussels, where in response to the question of whether, by using European legal means, we can actually rule out the type of collective redress found in the US, a representative of your Directorate General clearly said 'no we cannot'.
That in our opinion means that we must not disregard this model completely.
We must continue to discuss it, but to do so with great care and to include the Member States and their legal options in the discussion so that ultimately we achieve what it is we all want, and that is a real European model that is particularly attractive to consumers and that also protects small and medium-sized enterprises.
Mr President, I know the Commissioner is aware that tomorrow 4 000 consumers will go to the High Court in the UK to seek compensation for severe allergic reactions, hospitalisation and death as the result of the use of a chemical in sofas and household goods, which has now been banned in the EU.
France, Sweden and Poland have reported similar cases and injuries.
Across Europe there are potentially many thousands of consumers who have suffered severe injuries as a result of this toxic chemical.
I believe that citizens support European intervention when it is seen to give real help to consumers to tackle real problems.
Real help in such cases means giving them the right to take action collectively, wherever they buy goods and services.
So our committee launched an online consultation on the Commission proposal for consumer rights.
We received many responses, many of which - from businesses and consumers - highlighted the need for effective access to cross-border remedies and redress.
There are, I believe, enough cases like the toxic sofa case with enough compelling evidence to prove that a range of options for collective redress is needed, not only to improve access to justice, but equally to deter illegal or unfair business practices.
Of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap, affordable means, such as ADR, but I believe today's debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens, to ensure they get a fair deal, real redress and real remedies.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that we, too, in principle welcome the European Commission's proposal and this Green Paper.
As previous speakers have said, there is no doubt that there is a 'mass' phenomenon in which relatively small losses affect a large number of people.
The individual losses are small, but taken together the overall amount is large.
We need an instrument to deal with this problem.
In my opinion, it is right to consider something like this.
Staying with the positives, I also very much welcome the fact that, in its Green Paper, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition, which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms.
I think that the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has come further in its Green Paper than the members of the Directorate General for Competition.
However, I would like to make two things quite clear, which in my opinion should definitely be viewed as critical comments.
In a few minutes at noon, Parliament will adopt my report on the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition.
With a huge majority in this House we will demand that the European Commission choose a horizontal approach in dealing with this issue.
We must not end up with sectoral instruments: one for the area of consumer protection, one of the area of antitrust law, another one for the capital market, perhaps another one for the environment, perhaps another one for social affairs, all contradicting each other, all encroaching on the legal systems of the Member States and leading ultimately to legal confusion that can no longer be managed by any practitioner.
We have often seen such examples in the past.
I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive, which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable.
The Commission should not make the same mistake again in this case.
It should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset.
That is the clear position of Parliament, as will become apparent in a few minutes.
One last point: I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed that we do not want a claims industry based on the American model with a turnover of USD 240 billion a year from which ultimately only lawyers profit and the consumers get absolutely nothing.
We want the genuine rule of law in Europe and we want to keep our traditional system and our understanding of the law.
(ES) Mr President, in a market without borders such as Europe, it is important that, as well as ensuring healthy competition, we equally zealously safeguard consumers.
Throughout the last half century, trade barriers have been breaking down for products, but largely these barriers still stand for the consumers.
Abusive commercial practices are often not reported by consumers or pursued by consumer organisations because of a general awareness that it is difficult to obtain compensation.
Collective redress saves effort when many people are affected and offers a much better chance of reaching a compensation agreement.
Due to the cross-border nature of a large part of economic transactions in the European Union, this right of collective action cannot be restricted to national limits
We need a real initiative spanning all of Europe, which would have to bring about a certain degree of harmonisation or alignment among existing national systems in order to be effective.
The model of choice must aim to provide easy consumer access to the system, and avoid exaggerated costs and bureaucracy.
Therefore, I consider that we must prioritise alternative conflict resolution procedures, since they offer more flexibility, as well as simplified and less costly legal proceedings.
(DE) Mr President, there is a large consensus in this House that we must provide better protection for consumers, particularly where, in the case of small losses for individuals, large numbers of these losses cause a problem, because they cannot see any possibility of a meaningful individual claim.
The question is how should consumer protection and the improvement of the same be organised?
In this regard, I think it is very important - and I am very grateful to the Commission for this - that we should quite deliberately say that we want to examine all of the alternatives and all of the aspects of this complex issue and only after careful consideration decide on the solutions.
I would like to address one aspect in this context that has not yet been mentioned.
We have already found - and in future this may increasingly be the case - that, for many non-governmental organisations and many consumer protection associations, the possibility of arranging mass claims is becoming advertising material.
This danger should be included quite deliberately in our considerations so that we do not ultimately help those who do not need help and leave those who do need help out in the rain.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank you for all your valuable opinions.
In a way, I am familiar with most of them because we have been discussing, point by point, the most important parts of your concerns and hopes for having collective redress in Europe.
I should like to reiterate once again that I am totally with you in not wanting US-style class actions to be introduced into European culture.
I know that is one of your most important preoccupations.
As Ms McCarthy also mentioned, this is about damages.
This is already happening in the UK, but this has nothing to do with what we are discussing and what I am proposing as our future steps in this direction.
In this respect, I would like to stress the following.
Checking to see whether there is a real need for collective redress: yes, we are doing that and we will continue to do so after the green paper.
Respecting constitutional constraints: yes.
Avoiding US-style class action: yes.
Ensuring that damages are compensated, including all costs incurred by the consumer but, at the same time, excluding any element of punitive damage: yes, that is what we have in mind.
Discouraging unmeritorious claims, as referred to by Mr Rack: yes.
Promoting alternative dispute resolution schemes: of course, because this is less time-consuming, more affordable and easier for both consumers and businesses, and also respecting subsidiarity.
With these few words, I would like to say that we are fully aware of the challenges and we are ready to face these challenges and make a good proposal, step by step, building consensus and common understanding with you.
What I really appreciate today is that all of us recognise that we have a problem and that we are ready to address this problem.
So this really is a very good starting point for the next stage of debates.
As this is a challenge we face, I would like in particular to stress what Mr Lehne referred to - the common approach, the horizontal approach with Commissioner Kroes.
Commissioner Kroes and myself, as well as our respective services, are cooperating very closely in order to ensure that our initiatives are consistent and produce synergies.
The consistency principle does not necessarily rule out that specific situations require specific solutions.
Each of the two initiatives has a distinct focus.
Whereas the consumer green paper deals with redress for breaches of consumer protection law, the competition white paper is strictly about competition law infringements.
Another major difference between the two initiatives is that, whereas the consumer green paper only covers redress for consumers, the redress mechanism suggested in the competition white paper is designed to benefit both consumers and businesses.
So my challenge is to achieve effective redress for our consumers and thereby restore their confidence in the market.
From previous discussions, I know that the European Parliament is supporting us in our efforts to achieve this goal.
Let me stress again that Parliament, together with Member States and stakeholders, will be convinced that not only is there a problem but also that an effective and balanced solution must and can be found at European level.
I should like to thank you for this fruitful debate and your valuable opinions, and I look forward to working with you on this file over the coming months.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I would like to congratulate the European Commission's efforts to improve the methods which consumers can use to exercise their rights throughout Europe.
The options presented in the Green Paper must be discussed in detail.
However, one thing that is already certain is that option No 4, which would introduce a class of 'opt-out' type actions, offering consumer organisations a share of the compensation payments, is not sustainable (viable).
If we want to boost consumer confidence in the internal market, we need to consider a combination of options 2 and 3.
In other words, we must create a European network of national executive public authorities which will enjoy greater powers to intervene effectively in the case of international claims (abroad).
Furthermore, we must review alternative mechanisms for resolving existing disputes and, if necessary, introduce a new mechanism enabling consumer rights to be applied (exercised) more effectively outside the courts too.
I would like to conclude by emphasising that we must ensure that we adopt a horizontal approach with regard to the collective redress mechanism, thereby avoiding the fragmentation of national legislation and establishing a single, common instrument for all Member States.

- Before the vote:
Mr President, I am sorry to trouble colleagues in a long voting session, but it has been newly marked on the voting list that Amendment 80 to a recital falls if Amendment 37 is passed.
The first half of the amendment is exactly the same but the new bit - the second part - is consistent.
Amendment 81, which is the corresponding amendment to the article, is not marked as falling when the corresponding article amendment, 55, is passed.
Therefore, I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37, if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81.
Thank you, Mrs Bowles.
It is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I do not think this can be added as an addition.
It should be taken separately.

Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B6-0227/09).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Subject: Anti-Lisbon rhetoric
The global financial crisis has shown us just how imperative it is to have a strong European Union.
We have learnt quickly in Ireland that myths and disinformation about the Lisbon Treaty will be small comfort in a shrinking economy and with rising unemployment.
With the EU Presidency held by the Czech Republic, and the country's own President espousing anti-Lisbon rhetoric, how does the Council intend to reconcile these messages with the patent need for greater, rather than less, EU cooperation?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has always made plain its determination to strengthen cooperation within the EU, particularly in times of crisis.
The Czech Presidency, following on from the activities of its predecessor, is working hard to resolve the problems caused by the current financial and economic crisis and in this context has adopted measures at various levels. It has established a joint framework for Member States, as can be seen for example from the bank rescue plan, the European economic recovery plan, the regulation and supervision of financial markets.
The European Parliament has also contributed to these measures by supporting investment in infrastructure, and not least through its efforts on the international scene. The Council at its meeting of 19 and 20 March focused on overcoming the financial crisis and the problems of the real economy and made it very clear that Europe can confront these problems and stop the current crisis only through unified and coordinated action within the framework of the single market and economic and monetary union.
The Council decided at its meeting on 19 March that a closely coordinated EU response within the framework of the European economic recovery plan should mobilise all available instruments, including Community resources, and that it should fully integrate the strategies of growth, employment, social integration and social security.
As far as the Treaty of Lisbon is concerned, the Council reached an agreement in December last year concerning further progress.
At the request of Ireland, the Member States agreed to provide specific legal guarantees relating to the issues that were a source of concern during last year's referendum in Ireland.
The Council also agreed that if the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, then in accordance with essential legal procedures a decision would be adopted on the continuing national representation of each Member State in the Commission.
With the exception of the completion of detailed related activities focused on this topic by mid 2009 and assuming a satisfactory implementation, the Irish government at the same time committed to work for the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of the current functional period of the Commission.
The European Council in its meeting of 19 and 20 March was informed of the current situation regarding this matter and decided to return to it at the June 2009 meeting.
Madam President, may I thank the Minister for his reply.
I think we are far too defensive in this House - and in institutions generally - when it comes to Lisbon and the European Union in general.
It is time that we put some of the people who are attacking Europe on the defensive.
Where would we be without the European Central Bank?
Where would we be - those of us who are in the euro zone - without the euro zone?
The one thing we do not have is an identifiable head of the European Council who can speak on matters of economic recovery, and I think it is clear that the provision in the Lisbon Treaty to provide for such a person is really essential.
If we had that person in place now we would not have the zigzagging that goes on between the six-monthly presidencies.
Perhaps the Minister might say in his reply what he sees as the prospects for the ratification of the Treaty in the Czech Republic.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) I will respond to all of the questions later, in one go.
It is our normal procedure for you to reply firstly to the questioner and his supplementary question and then, normally, I will - and that is my decision - take the other supplementary questions together and put them to you.
I should be obliged if you would answer first.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Thank you, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will answer the question.
I would like to emphasise that in the Czech Republic, as far as ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is concerned, the two-chamber Parliament made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate is working very hard on this Treaty and on 18 February this year it was passed by the House of Representatives.
Here I must stress that under Czech constitutional rules it is essential to have a constitutional majority to pass this Treaty.
The Senate of the Czech Parliament will probably vote on the Treaty on 6 May, but the Senate has made its approval conditional on the drafting of an appropriate law under which the transfer of powers from the level of qualified majority voting requires the consent of both chambers of Parliament.
This amounts to a so-called conditional mandate.
The relevant law has already been drafted and approved, and we expect that on 6 May the Senate will vote on this law and that, once it is passed, the Treaty of Lisbon will receive parliamentary ratification.
Does the Czech Presidency not agree that the problem in the case of the Lisbon Treaty is not so much a lack of information about it, since the information is there and is available, but the considerable amount of misinformation wilfully put about by the opponents of the Treaty?
Given that the Treaty is not being signed by the European institutions but was negotiated by the Member States, does it not also agree that the national governments must do much more to counter the myths and misinformation that Mr Mitchell referred to and get their act together in this vital debate for the future of Europe?
Minister, I am sure that in your country, as in Ireland, voters sense and worry about the Orwellian feel to the EU at the moment.
They are not stupid, and they know that the Commission gerrymandered its legislative agenda so that no bad news entered the Irish media's bloodstream.
It is a shame that Mr Mitchell, Mr Corbett and others are so blinded by the glittering prizes of being successful Eurocrats that they miss the point: that the people of Ireland have delivered their decision.
Perhaps, sir, you could get the Council to instruct the Commission to stop the massive growth of its communication and information - otherwise known as propaganda - departments, and allow the results delivered by the wonderful Irish people to stand and prove that democracy lives in the European Union.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) I must emphasise that we should all have the courage to admit to ourselves that EU citizens have very little awareness of how the EU operates.
The EU affects EU citizens very often in an abstract way and its institutions are very difficult to understand. The lower the level of awareness the easier it is for conditions to arise that are conducive to, for example, misinformation, which takes a hold on people's minds more readily precisely because they are not sufficiently informed about how the EU operates.
In my opinion, addressing the democratic deficit and addressing the fact that citizens do not always identify with the EU and its institutions would ensure that disinformation and lies do not have a chance to take hold.
I firmly believe that every EU Member State government has a fundamental duty to speak out against disinformation and falsehood. At the same time EU Member States' governments should inform their citizens regularly about all matters relating to European integration.
I firmly believe that only then will we achieve real democratic progress.
Subject: Double taxation
In view of the recent case-law of the Court of Justice concerning double taxation, what measures does the Council intend to propose in order to harmonise European tax law so that European citizens do not have to pay twice for the same taxable transaction?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the current state of affairs in the Community is concerned, no measures have yet been adopted at a Community level to eliminate double taxation in the area of direct taxation except for Council Directive 90/435/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States, the convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises and Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments.
This arises from the fact that the area in question falls within the responsibility of Member States, provided that they respect Community law.
Agreements on eliminating double taxation which are concluded bilaterally between Member States in accordance with the aforementioned autonomous powers and consistent with the OECD sample agreement do not appear to be sufficient for eliminating all legal double taxation in the EU.
The Commission, which has the exclusive right to initiate laws in the Community in relation to direct taxation, at present clearly prefers a pragmatic approach to this matter in view of the principle of subsidiarity that applies to Community legislation in the area of direct taxation and in view of the requirement for unanimity.
This pragmatic approach should encourage Member States to cooperate in ensuring that their domestic taxation systems, including bilateral agreements on taxation, are functioning smoothly.
This is mentioned, among other things, in the Commission communication on coordinating Member States' direct tax systems in the internal market, especially in the final version of document COM 2006/823.
The Council confirmed this coordination-based approach of the Commission in its conclusions of 27 March 2007.
It emphasised that the functioning of the internal market can be improved through cooperation in the area of taxation at a Member State level and, where appropriate, at a European level, while respecting Member State powers at the same time.
The Council declared that acceptable solutions could take various forms, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
(ES) Mr President, the information that you are giving us is correct, but we as Members of this House, and most definitely the citizens of Europe, get the impression that there is a very dangerous gap in Community law.
At present, whilst tax demands continue to be intensified in every one of the Member States, mobility is almost impossible.
When we ask the Commission to explain this pragmatic approach, it seems that the Commission does not have any support in the Council.
We seem to find ourselves in a vicious circle, in which the Commission refers us to the Council, and the Council refers us back to the Commission, but, meanwhile, the reality is that the citizens of this Europe that we are trying to build do not have the option to reside in different countries or to establish relationships, due to the heavy tax burden caused by the lack of harmonisation in the fiscal system.
Could the Council do something to put an end to this vicious circle?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) First of all I would like to emphasise that the long-term objective is a solution in the form of a directive or a multilateral treaty.
Only thus can we develop this system effectively from the standpoint of legal principles.
The Commission is proposing a solution for the most pressing problems arising in connection with the internal market, through improved coordination of Member State tax regulations and improved decision-making processes.
The Commission in its communication 823 on coordination put forward a proposal to create a mechanism for an effective resolution of disputes connected with international double taxation problems in the EU but due to insufficient support from the Member States, as the MEP mentioned here, the Commission abandoned this request in favour of other initiatives.
The Commission is fully aware of the impact of double taxation agreements on the internal market and it will start preparing public consultations in 2009. Based on these consultations the Commission will draft a communication on its findings together with a proposal for an acceptable solution to existing problems.
The Council has repeatedly grappled with this problem within the framework of various initiatives.
The first one was the expansion of the framework of Directive 90/435/EC on the common system of taxation for parent and subsidiary companies through Council Directive 2003/123/ES, which eliminates the economic and legal double taxation of cross-border flows of dividends within the framework of the Community.
In 1990 an arbitration treaty was adopted with the aim of eliminating double taxation arising from the setting of transfer prices between related enterprises.
Nevertheless this directive did not prove very effective, partly because it has the character of an international treaty concluded between Member States and not the character of a Community legal instrument.
In 2003 Directive 2003/49/EC was adopted, eliminating double taxation for interest and royalty payments between associated enterprises from different Member States, which authorises only the country of the beneficial owner of the payment to tax that payment.
The question of expanding the framework of this directive should form the topic of further negotiations in the Council.
In connection with the two communications from the Commission on coordinating Member State systems of direct taxation on the internal market and retirement tax, ECOFIN adopted the December 2008 Council resolution on retirement tax. This resolution endeavours to eliminate double taxation and coordinates state procedures in the area of retirement tax so that, with the transfer of economic activities from one state to another, when assets of physical or legal persons are transferred from the state which applies the tax on exit, then the recipient state should apply the market value of the asset which was exchanged at the time of the asset transfer from the exit state as an expenditure when the asset is sold.
We all understand that these issues on taxation can be very technical, but in general will the Minister agree that anyone who understands these issues will surely see that tax harmonisation is not essential to avoid double taxation?
All that is required - I know it is quite technical - is a will for better cooperation between Member States.
Given the amount of money that governments are currently taking away from hard-pressed taxpayers, surely it is time to encourage more tax competition to reduce the burden on working families across the European Union.
(DE) President-in-Office, I think that the Czech Presidency is taking a very positive and proactive approach to this issue.
I should like to congratulate you on that, because naturally it is important to protect citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises so that, when they provide services, they can also recover their income accordingly.
Double taxation is something for which there is no social justification whatsoever.
Hence my question: do you believe that the European Court of Justice could set standards here?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Court of Justice has decided that the direct application of community law, of freedom of movement and the principles of non-discrimination do not oblige Member States to eliminate legal double taxation arising through the mutual interaction of different taxation systems in cross-border situations within the Community.
This position arises from the decision of the European Court of Justice in case C-513/04 Kerckhaert Morres.
The court has already ruled on this matter and I firmly believe that very little scope remains here.
According to the case law of the Court of Justice, treaties eliminating double taxation must fulfil the requirements of the internal market, and in particular they must not introduce discrimination or discrepancies in relation to basic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty on the European Communities.
On the other hand I firmly believe that the risk of double taxation enormously complicates the tax systems and above all it complicates things for small and medium-sized enterprises, who sometimes find it very difficult to penetrate the complicated systems of individual national laws.
It is precisely SMEs that are most exposed to this risk, because SMEs have higher costs because they cannot afford to hire expensive consultancy or law firms in the way that large corporations - and particularly multinationals - can. Therefore SMEs are more burdened by these complicated tax systems.
I am personally convinced that the fairest solution is for all Member States to have the simplest, most transparent direct taxation system, and as far as I am concerned, the lowest possible taxes.
Subject: Poultry meat
In light of Commission proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets as regards the marketing standards for poultry meats, would the Czech Presidency agree that in the interest of food and consumer safety, traceability and product quality that all poultry meat sold as 'fresh' must provide consumers with a guarantee of freshness.
Would the Presidency agree that there is a serious problem with regard to poultry meat that is slaughtered and frozen in a third country, transported and defrosted - and in some cases processed - in an EU country, and subsequently marketed and sold as 'fresh' EU produce.
Would it agree that this is not acceptable and is misleading to the consumer and unfair to EU producers who adhere to strict EU guidelines?
What steps is the Czech Presidency currently taking to ensure the smooth adoption of this regulation?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency would like to assure the honourable Member that it places great importance on a high level of food safety and consumer protection within the framework of the Community regardless of whether the food is produced locally or imported from third countries.
In this context the Presidency would like to refer to the conclusions of the Council meeting of 18 and 19 December 2008 on the safety of imported agricultural products and food products.
In accordance with Community rules the Council in its conclusions invited the Commission to submit a report to the Council and to the European Parliament by the end of 2010 concerning the effectiveness and the application of hygienic and phytosanitary checks on imported foods.
As a result of its obligation to ensure high levels of human health protection when implementing Community policies, the Council in December 2008 rejected a proposal from the Commission for a Council regulation implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, regarding the use of antimicrobial substances to remove surface contamination from poultry carcases.
The Council took the view that the use of these substances could potentially mask poor hygiene practices.
The European Parliament expressed its opposition to the proposal in a resolution of 19 June 2008 and asked the Council to reject the proposal.
Regarding the Commission's proposal concerning trading standards for poultry meat, the Presidency would like to confirm that the proposal is at present under negotiation in the Council with the aim of ensuring a high level of protection for consumers and of preventing poultry being sold as fresh when it has previously been frozen.
The Presidency can assure the honourable Member that it is taking all measures to enable the rapid adoption of this regulation as soon as the European Parliament has issued its opinion.
I thank the Presidency for that reply because it was indeed my understanding that the Czech Presidency was to take action in this matter.
I am pleased to hear that it is being discussed within the Council that you will take action to prevent poultry meat being frozen and subsequently sold as fresh, because of course it means that many EU producers - indeed all EU producers - are not operating on a level playing field.
So I suppose my question to the Presidency is: how soon can we expect some response from the Council on this, and can you give us any indication as to what particular actions you might take in this matter?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this problem has now been resolved by the working bodies of the Council within the framework of the negotiations over a proposed Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets with regard to trading standards for poultry meat.
The Czech Presidency has proposed a compromise text for which the Council's Agriculture Committee has expressed majority support.
The text will be submitted for WTO assessment within the framework of consultations with trading partners.
If there is a positive result and the European Parliament approves its report at the plenary session at the same time, which should happen, then the Czech Presidency will submit the compromise text to the Council.
The Council has a formal obligation to await submission of the European Parliament's opinion, although it does not have to refer to it in its decision.
The compromise text states that for products made from fresh poultry meat in accordance with this regulation, Member States may stipulate slight variations in the temperature requirements which are applied for an absolute minimum time and only to the extent required for allowing handling and cutting up operations in processing plants during the production of fresh poultry meat products.
We expect that the Council will address itself to this proposal in May and based on negotiations to date we expect positive results.
Following the BSE crisis in the beef sector some years back, we brought in full identification and traceability for beef products in Europe.
Would the Council not agree that we need to move swiftly, not just on poultry but sheep and pigmeat as well, to give consumers the same information and indeed to provide the same traceability if something should go wrong?
The Sommer report on information to consumers is wending its way through Parliament at the moment, and perhaps through added labelling - which would add to the traceability - the Council might agree with me that this would be a way of achieving this.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in December last year the European Council agreed on a European economic recovery plan.
This plan includes concrete measures for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, the most important of which are the measures aimed at improving access to finance and reducing the administrative burden on business.
At the same time the European Council expressed its support for increased intervention by the European Investment Bank in the years 2008 to 2011, particularly with loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, which represents an increase of EUR 10 billion compared to current lending in this sector.
Additionally, the European Council has supported temporary overruns of threshold values for at least two years in relation state support involving sums up to EUR 500 000 and adjustments in the state support framework which are essential for boosting support to companies, particularly small and medium-sized ones.
The European Council also called for the use of accelerated procedures allowed under European Community law for awarding public contracts and for a reduction in the administrative burden on companies.
The European Council also supports full implementation of the Commission action plan on the Small Business Act initiative that was adopted by the Council on 1 December 2008.
The action plan for the Small Business Act initiative should help small and medium-sized enterprises in the period of economic turmoil by improving access to loans, reducing the administrative burden, helping small and medium-sized enterprises to exploit the benefits of the internal market and increasing competitiveness on foreign markets.
On 5 March the Council concluded that the action plan should be fully implemented as quickly as possible at Community and Member State levels while complying with the principles of subsidiarity.
Additionally, the Council again mentioned the importance of further improvements in access to finance - I am thinking of loans, guarantees, mezzanine finance, etc - and also to venture capital for newly established innovative enterprises and for small and medium-sized enterprises where it is necessary to take account of the effects of the current financial crisis.
We must strengthen market access for small and medium-sized enterprises above all through more monitoring of the market and of individual sectors in order to identify and tackle barriers to the internal market.
Requirements for accounting and procedures for setting up new companies should be essentially simplified and speeded up.
At its meeting on 19 and 20 March the European Council agreed on the following measures: eliminating existing barriers and preventing the emergence of new ones, achieving a fully functioning internal market, further reducing the administrative burden, improving the framework conditions for industry in order to retain a strong industrial base for enterprise with particular emphasis on small and medium-sized firms and innovation, supporting partnerships between the different areas of business, research, education and training and increasing the quality of investments in research, knowledge, and education.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say that on 10 March 2009 the Council achieved a political agreement that all Member States would have the option, based on a change to Directive 2006/112/EC, to implement permanently reduced VAT rates on a range of labour intensive services, and these are usually services provided by small enterprises, of course.
Among the other legislative proposals arising from the Small Business Act initiatives the Council should adopt a regulation on the Statute of the European Private Company which would make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to conduct cross-border business activities.
The Council will also look at revising the late payments directive, with the aim of ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises are paid on time for all commercial transactions.
As far as the agenda for better regulation is concerned, the Commission last year presented 11 new accelerated measures for reducing the administrative burden on business with the aim of achieving a 25% reduction in the existing administrative burden caused by EU regulations by 2012.
According to estimates, this could lead to savings of about EUR 30 billion, and the greatest benefit would go to small and medium-sized enterprises.
On 10 March this year the Council called on the Commission to propose specific new measures for reducing the burden in respect of each of the 13 key priority areas in the action plan.
The actual steps in relation to this include the adoption of proposals for simplifying the third and sixth directives applying to mergers and breakups of commercial undertakings at the first reading in the European Parliament, and also approving a revision of the fourth and seventh directives.
However, this important work should continue with the aim of achieving the 25% reduction in the administrative burden and the Commission should complete its review of all existing legal regulations as quickly as possible.
(EL) Madam President, I thank the minister for his reply, which listed all the measures planned.
Of course, now the application of these measures needs to bring real results to all those in the European Union at present who have small and medium-sized enterprises which are suffering the consequences of the crisis and to all those who want to set up new small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is on this point precisely that I would like the minister to tell me if we have statistics on new business start-ups, alongside the statistics on the businesses which are disappearing.
I would be interested in having these comparative figures, if not today, then in a future reply.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the conclusions from the meeting of 19 to 20 March 2009, the Council stated that mitigation and adaptation measures would require considerable domestic and financial resources, both public and private, particularly in the most threatened developing countries, and that the EU would provide a fair share of the funding for these measures in developing countries.
Commission estimates based on recent studies indicate that by 2020 the additional public and private investments will have to increase to almost EUR 175 billion if emissions are to be reduced to a level compatible with EU objectives.
Current studies also show that more than half of these investments will have to be made in developing countries.
The secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change further estimates that in 2030 the cost of adaptation in the developing countries would be in the range of EUR 23 to 54 billion a year.
As concerns funding for mitigation measures in developing countries, the Council has adopted a clear position.
With the help of developed countries developing countries should draw up strategies and plans for building a low-carbon economy.
These strategies and plans should make a distinction between measures that can be adopted independently as they involve either zero or very low expenditure or even a net benefit in the medium-term, and measures which will lead to positive additional costs that individual countries themselves cannot easily afford.
In order to implement the Copenhagen agreement it is essential to have sufficient, predictable and timely financial support.
The international financial structure providing this support must be based on principles of efficiency, suitability, equality, transparency, responsibility, cohesion, predictability and proper financial management.
In relation to funding sources, the Council confirmed options which may be further examined in international negotiations and which involve an approach relying on contributions based on an agreed scope, a market approach based on contract auctions or combinations of these and other options.
Moreover, during the transition to a global carbon trading market, flexible mechanisms, the clean development mechanism and joint implementation will continue to play a significant role in financing emission cuts in developing and transforming economies.
In relation to this it will be important to strengthen integrity from the perspective of the environment, the contribution to sustainable development and fair geographical distribution.
It is also necessary to expand the carbon trading market in order to send clear signals about the cost of carbon.
This involves one of the most cost-effective ways of cutting emissions while at the same time providing an obvious stimulus for the transfer to a low-carbon economy.
In connection with the EU agreement on the climate-energy package the Council has also emphasised the contribution of this package to EU efforts to secure funding for measures aimed at mitigating climate change and adapting to it.
It is clear that we must do much more in the area of funding.
The Council has decided to return to this topic in its June meeting, in order to further define its position in relation to ongoing international negotiations.
I should like to thank the Czech Presidency for a fulsome response.
I actually got it in writing earlier today because they did not think we would reach Question 10.
Can I assume that really is the view of the Czech Government, as you have just put on the record, because it would certainly encourage me greatly if I thought so?
I thank you, because it means the Czech Government has come a long way on climate change matters since the start of its Presidency.
Apart from the Council meeting in June, could you indicate the rest of the timetable for coming to an agreement on the so-called 'fair share' from the EU in financing third-country mitigation and adaptation?
I fully agree with what you say, by the way, on the carbon market and its contribution.
Thank you, Mrs Doyle.
I am intrigued to know that you had the answer in advance.
That is a practice I have wished to encourage from both Council and Commission for a very long time, so congratulations to you both on achieving that.
(Interjection from Avril Doyle: 'That is because they thought we would not reach Question 10!)
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the less time is left for the Presidency of this Czech government, the faster it seems to pass and that is perhaps why we are trying to hurry on and to deal with all of the administration on time.
I would like to say in response to the question from the honourable Member that the Council will discuss this topic again in June this year.
In the opinion of the Council it important to focus more on the financial mechanisms of the fight against climate change.
In advance of the Copenhagen meeting the Council will publish the EU approach to different ways of financing mitigation and adaptation measures, to supporting new technologies and to creating the right environment for implementing these plans.
The Council will also show how the EU will make a concrete contribution to these plans and it will explain how the costs will be shared out between the Member States, as well as the efforts towards implementing these aims.
All of this will be based on actual proposals from the Commission.
Concerning certain other problems related to financing the global agreement on combating climate change, the EU has made it clear that it wants to assume a proportionate share of responsibility in this matter.
Moreover, the EU has established basic principles relating to funding and has made it clear that it intends to discuss these options with its global partners.
However, it is obviously too soon to reveal our cards by publishing some of the numbers.
It would not be sensible, it would not be prudent, it would not be tactical.
We have an idea of how much funding will be needed to implement the global plan.
However, we must know at least approximately what sort of mitigation measures third countries are planning to implement.
In this context I would like to say that in 2007 the EU set out a voluntary commitment to cut emissions by 20% - and in the event of a successful global agreement by 30% - and this was long before any other country in the world had published anything at all on mitigation proposals.
While I have the opportunity, I will press the point, because it does seem to me that if answers to questions that we think we are not going to reach can be provided in advance then there is no reason why the questions that we are going to reach should not have the answers in advance, so that we can have - as we just had now - a better and more helpful exchange.
Thank you both for demonstrating that, which has made the point that many of us have long sought to make.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (debate)
The next item is the report by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities - C6-0354/2008 -
rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, Directive 2002/15/ΕC really did need revising and, following a report which it was obliged to present, the European Commission tabled suitable amendments to help this industry, in order to safeguard the health and safety of its workers and, at the same time, to facilitate healthy competition.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs accepted the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, despite my recommendation, rejected the Commission proposal; in other words, it did not agree to exempt self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive.
I must point out that the 2002 directive made provision for self-employed drivers to be included as of 23 March 2009.
Developments are not as they appear in the wake of the impressions and excitement caused by the debate on a directive on road transport.
As far as driving times and rest periods are concerned, there have been significant developments since 2002, because Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, which entered into force in 2007, applies to all lorry drivers and ensures they have suitable driving times and rest periods.
Therefore, to include self-employed drivers in a directive on working time would be to misunderstand the concept of self-employment, because when someone is self-employed, they set their own working time.
This would therefore be a serious, harmful action against small and medium-sized enterprises, it would restrict entrepreneurial freedom and we would be helping to create additional administrative burdens.
This would set a precedent for starting a debate on the integration of self-employed persons in other sectors, thereby limiting their ability to work as long as they like.
This leaves a serious problem: who is self-employed and who is a 'false' self-employed person?
It is clear that certain workers claim to be self-employed but are not.
The European Commission had proposed that we lay down criteria so that we can distinguish 'false' self-employed persons.
However, this would not be possible, because controls are still carried out nationally.
If, therefore, European legislation stipulated who was a 'false' self-employed person and who was not, this could not be made visible from national controls.
Thus we have the facility now, with our new proposals, to determine at Member-State level who will and who will not be included in the directive on persons performing mobile road transport activities.
We also call on the European Commission in our proposals to re-determine the results of the application of the directive.
I call on my fellow Members to reject the amendment which aims to refer the proposal back to committee and to support my group's proposals, which are also supported by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Independence and Democracy Group.
Madam President, honourable Members, you know that road safety is one of the priorities of my work as Commissioner for Transport.
It is also important to emphasise from the outset that, while road safety is of course a key element when discussing an issue such as drivers' working time, our debate today is not about road safety but about social legislation, not driving time but working time.
The question we must answer today is this: should self-employed contractors be subject to restrictions on working time on the same terms as employees?
This is something we must look at very carefully, because there are no precedents in European law establishing how long a self-employed person can work for in an office or laboratory.
In 1998, when the Council and Parliament first debated the directive on the working time of mobile workers, the situation in the road transport sector was totally different from what it is today, as the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, said: at the time it was common practice to dodge the rules in force on driving time, meaning that professional drivers spent far too long at the wheel.
On the basis of the previous regulation on driving time, introduced in 1985, it was nigh on impossible to control driving time effectively.
In that context, between 1988 and 2002 legislators discussed a Commission proposal aimed at regulating the working time not only of employee drivers, but also of the self-employed.
As a result of that discussion, the sectoral directive on the working time of mobile workers was adopted.
The hope was to reduce the negative consequences for road safety arising from inadequate driving time rules by extending the scope of the laws on working time to include self-employed drivers.
The problem was not resolved, however, and following a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council, the Commission was invited to weigh up the pros and cons of extending working time rules to self-employed workers and thus present a proposal in 2008.
The Commission met this request, publishing a detailed study in 2007 that came to the following conclusions.
Firstly, that working time must not be confused with driving time.
As far as the latter is concerned, the situation has changed radically.
As you know, this House, together with the Council, has adopted new rules on driving time.
Among other things, these rules provide for the use of the digital tachograph, an extremely reliable monitoring device, and a specific implementing directive.
The new rules, which have been in force since 2007, apply to all lorry drivers, thus including self-employed drivers.
With the new digital tachograph, which records a lorry's every move, minute by minute, a driver cannot drive for more than nine hours a day and an average of 45 hours a week.
In essence, it is now possible to monitor the application of these rules much more rigorously than it was in 1985.
Secondly, there are no precedents in Community social legislation governing the work of the self-employed.
A self-employed worker cannot in fact be forced to do extra hours insofar as he is, by definition, free to organise his own work as he wishes.
What is more, it is virtually impossible in practice to control the working time of this group of people.
Thirdly, the overall balance between the advantages and disadvantages of extending the rules on working time to the self-employed is very uncertain, and it is not possible to demonstrate that applying the directive in question to self-employed drivers will bring clear advantages.
Lastly, it is very important to point out that the application of working time rules to self-employed drivers is ineffectual and very difficult to achieve, since these drivers do not have to record their working time for salary purposes, not to mention the fact that the administrative costs of applying such rules would be very high.
Fourthly, one aspect where intervention is needed, however, is that of 'false self-employed drivers', that is to say drivers who are formally self-employed, but in reality are not free to organise their own working activity, because they are entirely dependent on a single company that provides their income and their orders.
In social terms, they are vulnerable.
Now, in theory, they are covered by the directive, but the failure to apply it means that this does not happen in practice.
The Commission's proposal is therefore to step up the implementation of the directive and provide 'false' self-employed drivers with the social protection they need.
At a time of economic crisis, to impose an additional administrative and financial burden on small and fragile businesses, which must face the consequences of the recession, would not send a good message.
For this reason, in conclusion, the Commission welcomes the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Independence and Democracy Group, which are in line with the Council's common position adopted during the last Transport Council, and, through these amendments, is sending a clear message to the industry: the phenomenon of 'false' self-employed drivers will not be tolerated, and legislators will ensure that the rules are applied throughout Europe.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (NL) Madam President, the moment of truth is fast approaching.
Tomorrow afternoon, we shall be voting on the report by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou.
The rapporteur and I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, share the same perspective on free enterprise, and so together we have signed 10 or so amendments that the Council, too, can accept.
I am grateful that Commissioner Tajani can support them.
Tomorrow, we shall first have to deal with the amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that seeks to reject the proposal.
I am still highly indignant about this amendment.
Last week, however, this indignation turned to horror when I saw the position paper of the European trade unions.
For fear of a stray Romanian or Bulgarian self-employed driver, it dusts off untruth upon untruth to persuade MEPs to vote against the Commission proposal.
The paper intimates that self-employed drivers work 86-hour weeks.
Drivers, both employed and self-employed, are permitted to drive for an average of 45 hours per week in a two-week period, as Commissioner Tajani has also pointed out.
Are we to understand, then, that they are spending 41 hours per week working on their businesses?
Nor does the paper's argument about road safety hold water.
There is no evidence of a correlation between road safety and exempting self-employed drivers from the rules on working time; in fact, the reverse is true.
Incidentally, it is clear from the position paper that the trade unions know full well that their position is extremely tenuous.
The environment and the internal market are dragged in kicking and screaming to supposedly demonstrate that we should vote in favour of the rejection proposal, when the Commission's very extensive impact assessment shows that the proposal will actually be beneficial to the functioning of the internal market, the transport sector and the environment.
That is why, tomorrow, we must vote against the amendment tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that seeks to reject the proposal, and in favour of the rapporteur's amendments.
I trust that common sense will prevail during the vote.
Finally, I wish to add that I thought the email Mr Hughes sent last Saturday completely inappropriate.
Making politics out of the fatalities of ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, working time restrictions should not extend to self-employed entrepreneurs and drivers, and, fortunately, both the Commission and the Council have reached this conclusion.
In my country, Finland, a restriction on working time would have a very adverse effect on self-employed drivers.
Drivers in Finland tend to be small-scale entrepreneurs.
Over half own the vehicle they drive.
They therefore do everything themselves: they maintain their vehicles and do their own accounts.
Self-employed drivers are already bound by the same limits on driving time and compulsory rest periods as drivers who are employed by someone else.
This is important for the future.
Driving times themselves should not be extended, but if this amendment by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament were to enter into force, drivers would not be able to maintain their vehicles or do their accounts during their time off, for example.
In any case, how would compliance with such a regulation be monitored?
It is vitally important to aid employment and entrepreneurship during an economic crisis.
I hope that everyone will agree with the Commission and the Council of Transport Ministers to keep self-employed drivers outside the scope of regulated working time under this Directive.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament considers the proposal for the revision of the rules on working time in road transport insufficiently well thought out and inconsistent.
Poor transposition of and compliance with the legislation cannot be a reason to relax the rules.
As the Commission says, legislation can be efficient and effective only if it covers all parties concerned.
In questions to the Commission, I have endeavoured to obtain clarity as to what action the Commission plans to take against the use of 'false' self-employed workers.
In this context, the intention that has now been voiced in the Council not only to exclude self-employed drivers from the scope but also to omit to take satisfactory action against 'false' self-employed workers finds no favour with the PSE Group.
The activities of both employed and self-employed drivers are equally relevant to their own and to other people's safety.
Making a distinction is out of the question in the eyes of our group.
I must support the Commissioner: it is not the first time that self-employed workers, too, have been included in the coordination of safety on construction sites in order to guarantee their own safety and the safety of others.
During its last session of this parliamentary term, Parliament must adopt the directive on the working time of mobile workers.
As rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I think that it is irresponsible of us to support the rejection of the Commission's text in its entirety, as was suggested.
We Liberals support and firmly stand behind the need for the tens of thousands of self-employed mobile workers to retain their competitive advantage and the purpose of being self-employed.
The current situation is alarming.
The current directive removes a fundamental principle of the free market, namely, entrepreneurship and support for it.
It is unacceptable for us to treat those working according to a labour agreement on an equal footing with those who are self-employed.
Unlike salaried workers, the self-employed work on the basis not of a specified number of hours, but of the goods which they handle as well as the number and type of shipments.
Including them in the new directive will actually destroy their entrepreneurial drive.
Legislation stipulating the working time for the self-employed would mark a dangerous, unjustified precedent.
There is no similar kind of regulation in any other sector.
Adopting such a decision would have an adverse impact on the European economy.
The definition of night work is also of great practical significance.
At the moment, Member States can define night time themselves.
This enables them to maximise the number of working hours for transporting passengers and goods according to the varying daylight.
As you know, night time in Finland is different to night time in Italy.
Flexibility helps reduce congestion during peak hours, while also reducing the majority of harmful emissions from traffic.
I would finally like to add that the Liberals, supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and many other fellow Members, would like to continue the debate on the basic elements of the directive.
In other words, we support the flexible, pragmatic position which was approved in the Council and proposed by the European Commission on excluding the self-employed from the directive.
I strongly urge you to vote in favour of this.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the concern throughout the world and all the measures currently being taken to combat swine flu, like those taken a few years ago against bird flu and BSE, are completely out of proportion to the lack of consideration given to the much higher number of deaths on the roads.
Forty thousand people die every year on the roads of the European Union.
Large numbers of people are injured or permanently disabled.
All of this is simply accepted, as if it were an act of God.
Everyone knows that a disproportionate number of lorries is involved in serious road accidents.
The main causes are speed, overtiredness and alcohol.
This directive is a move towards ensuring that drivers do not become overtired.
Not only driving times, which are monitored using the tachograph, but also loading and unloading times should now be considered as working time for everyone.
This is the right solution.
If a driver has been working for several hours before he climbs behind the steering wheel of a 40-tonne truck, he is already tired and will find it difficult to concentrate.
For me it is completely incomprehensible that this regulation should only apply to drivers who are employed by others and are not self-employed.
The only excuse is that it is more difficult to monitor the working time of self-employed people.
This may be true, but does a self-employed driver present a smaller risk behind the steering wheel when he is overtired?
Madam President, we need to reject this proposal from the Commission for three clear reasons.
Firstly, they argue that Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, on driving and rest time, covers everyone and therefore there is no problem excluding the self-employed.
This is wrong.
Driving time represents only half - on average - of the working time of a driver.
Those not covered could indeed end up working 86 hours per week, every week of the year.
Secondly, the hundreds of thousands of drivers driving vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes are not covered by the Regulation.
Worse still, if they are excluded from this directive there will be no limits at all on their working time.
Thirdly, the Commission makes a distinction between self-employed and 'false' self-employed, and says it does this because you cannot inspect or control the working time of the self-employed.
If that is so, how will they control the working time of the 'false' self-employed?
This is an abdication of responsibility and an open invitation to unscrupulous employers to constantly search for new forms of 'false' self-employment to avoid the law.
We need to reject this proposal from the Commission.
(FI) Madam President, firstly I wish to thank Commissioner Tajani for having done a really excellent job and who, in his speech just now, very commendably pointed out that this is not about safety and the number of hours spent driving so much as the number of hours spent working.
We have to respect the fact that in Europe there are small and medium-sized enterprises that do their work and create jobs, and this would be a slap in the face for small-scale entrepreneurs, especially in the current economic situation.
Two weeks or so ago we had a fierce debate here on how small and medium-sized enterprises keep the entire European economy going.
Now we face the practical issue of whether we should support them or not.
What Commissioner Tajani stated here is what we should be monitoring and what we need to do to ensure that these self-employed drivers can continue working after the hours they have spent driving.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reassure those Members who have expressed concerns regarding the text we are debating.
Road safety is definitely not at stake, I repeat, it is one of my priorities to fight to reduce the number of road accidents.
I think we should not confuse working time with driving time.
I can well appreciate what you have said: a self-employed worker can work first and then be tired when he gets behind the wheel, but I do not think that a self-employed worker can be controlled in any job.
Obviously, the self-employed worker is also aware of what he is doing, he can even load a lorry and wait and rest for two, three, or four hours, and then get back behind the wheel in an excellent condition as regards safety.
It is in fact very difficult to control any kind of self-employed worker, artisan or small entrepreneur.
What is more, these are the men and women who represent the backbone of the EU economy.
Having said this, we are concerned with guaranteeing the health and safety of employees and of those workers who appear to be self-employed, but for all intents and purposes are employees.
That is why the Commission - and I think the rapporteur shares our position on this - wants to bring the activities of 'false' self-employed workers under legislative control too.
So this is, I believe, an important signal, this legislation meets real requirements, and I think it right to emphasise again how important it is to make further progress in this area.
That is why I would ask the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to reflect on the comments that have been made and to understand that, as far as the Commission is concerned, road safety is and will remain a priority, but that this legislation does not cover that sector, rather it is aimed at better regulating the working time above all of road transport workers, and to assimilate the 'false self-employed' to 'employees' because in reality they are not self-employed workers, but de facto employees.
So then, may I reassure again all those who have expressed concerns, because I believe that the text that may be adopted is a good text, heading in the general direction of the interests of European citizens.
rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his clear speech and his ex-post clarifications, by which I mean his assurance to the Members that his main objective is road safety and, at the same time, to safeguard the competitiveness of the European economy and support small and medium-sized enterprises.
I thank all my fellow Members for their views and I would point out that this is precisely the dialogue that we want to leave open by voting against Amendment 54 rejecting the Commission's proposal.
I therefore call on all my fellow Members to reject Amendment 54, so that the dialogue remains open and we can help workers who are being exploited and who claim to be 'false' self-employed persons.
We want to help improve employment in road transport with full safeguarding of road safety under the regulation that covers everyone and of working times under the directive before us.
I should like to remind the Members that I have sent them an article from a German newspaper which makes clear from the examples given that the risk during driving is not from excessive work, but from poor use of the time which each person has at his disposal, regardless of whether he is employed or self-employed, which is, in fact, irrelevant.
What is important is how each person takes responsibility for his actions and drives in such a way as to behave as a mature person who is conscious of his obligations within society as a whole.
We shall not achieve this by raising obstacles to work.
In referring to the building industry, Mr Cremers revealed the intention of all those who are supporting these views in the run-up to the elections.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 5 May 2009.

Economic Recovery Programme: energy projects (
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, after consulting briefly with the rapporteur, we agreed that paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the legislative resolution should be adjusted.
I would suggest the following English text for paragraph 2:
'Considers that the reference amount indicated in the legislative proposal is compatible with the multiannual financial framework as the latter has been revised;'
In paragraph 3, the first sentence should be deleted, the rest remaining unchanged: 'Recalls that any redeployment that would lead...' and so on.
Paragraph 5: 'Recalls that the legislative process has been completed after the financing of the programme has been agreed;'.

Presentation of the work programme of the Swedish Presidency (debate)
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on presentation of the work programme of the Swedish Presidency.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, honourable Members, allow me first to congratulate you on the election of your new president.
I am looking forward to working with Jerzy Buzek during the Swedish Presidency - and of course also in the time thereafter.
It is an honour for me to address the European Parliament as President-in-Office of the European Council.
I know that approaching half of you have been elected to this assembly for the first time.
Collectively, you all give a voice to 500 million Europeans.
There are great expectations of you.
I am addressing you during a challenging period.
Rarely has the EU cooperation faced harsher tests and tests so varied in nature.
In the short term we aim to ensure a smooth transition to a new treaty - the Treaty of Lisbon.
Now and in the slightly longer term, we must continue to manage the economic and financial crisis.
Under the surface is the threat of a growing climate crisis which, in the long term, is the greatest challenge we face.
One thing is clear.
If the Swedish Presidency is to succeed in the many challenges facing it, we must work alongside you - you who work at the heart of European democracy.
We hope for your support and cooperation, and that you are prepared to take on the challenges together with us.
When we talk of the history of the EU, we tend to maintain that the cooperation has created a foundation for peace in a Europe that has so often been characterised by the opposite.
I would like to tell you that my grandfather was a Swedish soldier posted to the Norwegian border during the Second World War - a war in which Sweden was neutral.
The nearest my grandfather got to the war was to occasionally get a glimpse of it - from a safe distance.
For a long time, that was Sweden's relationship with Europe: observing from a distance.
While Europe was left in ruins after the Second World War, Sweden was untouched.
We were richer economically - but poor in terms of European community.
Twenty years ago the barbed wire between Austria and Hungary was cut.
The Berlin Wall came down, and Europe changed almost overnight.
A number of countries then set out on the journey that resulted in representatives of 27 countries sitting in this room today.
Sweden was one of these countries.
If you are a late starter, you need time to catch up.
In the late 1980s political commitment for Europe began to mature in Sweden.
Slowly the realisation of Sweden's closeness to and dependence on Europe grew.
Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt played a decisive role in the work on bringing Sweden into the European community - in other words, accepting openness, globalisation and free trade.
He was driven by a firm conviction that Sweden belonged in Europe.
Eighteen years ago we made our application for membership of the European Union.
We had finally matured in our conviction that people's lives and our future could best be served by cooperation and community with others, that we had something to contribute - and that we had much to learn.
We were no longer afraid of cooperating.
We dared to be part of Europe.
These years from the mid-1980s onwards, which were revolutionary for Sweden, ran in parallel with a deepening of my own political commitment.
I had a strong yearning for Europe, as did many of my generation of Swedish politicians.
I remember how as a young, newly elected member of the Swedish parliament I was invited to visit the European Parliament.
It was a sign of Parliament's openness and accessibility - despite the fact that at that time Sweden was not a member of the Union.
A few years later, in 1997, after Sweden had joined the Union, I was involved in putting together the PPE Group's youth organisation, Youth of EPP, and I myself became its first chairman.
It enabled me to see how European cooperation worked in practice.
Together we sought European solutions to European problems.
We got to know not only each other, but also each other's history and culture.
It enabled me to get to know the capital cities of Europe - and I can hardly count the number of churches I visited in Europe in the process.
In 20 years Sweden has gone from observing at a distance to being an active part of the European cooperation.
This has in turn had an effect on the Swedish population.
Ten years ago, one in three Swedes thought EU membership was good for the country, but just as many thought the opposite.
Today that has reversed.
Nearly two in three Swedes believe that EU membership is good for Sweden.
In the elections to the European Parliament in June, more that 45 per cent of Swedes turned out to vote.
That is eight per cent more than in 2004, and it is above the average for Europe.
Today Sweden is a country that appreciates and takes a positive view of EU membership.
We woke up to it a bit late, but we have worked hard to catch up.
That is a victory for all of us who believe in European cooperation.
(Applause)
Mr President, honourable Members, we are facing the question of the fate of our generation - a social problem which, unlike many others, is growing slowly - and only in the wrong direction.
Our planet has a fever.
Its temperature is rising - and it is up to us to react.
The Greenland icecap is shrinking by more than 100 cubic kilometres every year.
The icecap in the Western Antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate.
We know that the shrinking Greenland ice alone could result in an increase in sea levels of up to two metres.
The effects will be dramatic.
If the sea level were to rise by just one metre around the world, a hundred million people would be forced to leave their homes in Asia alone.
The most vulnerable are those in Bangladesh, eastern China and Vietnam.
There would also be other serious consequences, however.
The weather will change, with the risk that many species of flora and fauna could become extinct.
This is the case even if we stay within the 2 °C target set by the UN, which was backed last week both by the G8 and by the Major Economies Forum in L'Aquila.
Our climate is under threat from both our use of and our dependence on fossil fuels.
That is the bad news.
So what is the good news?
Although time is short, it is still on our side.
We must act now, however.
We already have everything in place to expand renewable energy and the technology to improve energy efficiency.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than half of the measures required in order not to exceed the 2 °C target can be taken using the technology we already have.
Moreover, measures to counter climate change have very useful side effects - effects which in themselves justify the measures.
If we consume less energy, we will save money.
We will improve public finances while at the same time households will have greater resources.
If we invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we will improve our energy security.
We will be less dependent on imports from countries that are sometimes both politically and economically unstable.
Our investments in the green economy will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the decades ahead.
Allow me to give a specific example.
In January, many EU countries were affected by the gas crisis in Ukraine.
Last week I spoke to President Yushchenko concerning how we can try to avoid a similar thing happening again.
At the same time, it is important to be able to turn the viewpoint around.
If Ukraine invested in energy efficiency so that the country reached the same level as the Czech Republic or Slovenia, the amount of energy saved would correspond to the entire country's gas imports for its own use from Russia.
Ukraine could then become completely independent of gas imports from Russia and save a great deal of money besides - simply by improving its own energy efficiency.
This is where we must seek the answers where the climate is concerned.
(Applause)
Twelve years ago a coalition of the willing was formed in Kyoto.
However, voluntary agreements are not enough.
If we are to succeed in getting an international agreement on climate change in place, then the journey from Kyoto to Copenhagen must move from being a coalition of the willing to being everyone's responsibility.
So how do we get there?
Europe must act together and collectively.
We must show leadership and keep our promises.
Europe is crucial to getting others to join an international agreement.
All over the world we must set a price on emissions.
We must start using national carbon taxes and emissions trading.
The environmentally friendly alternatives will then emerge.
If the price of using fossil fuels is set without regard to climate impact, global warming will continue.
The alternatives will not emerge.
Measures to increase energy efficiency will not become economically worthwhile.
That is not enough, however.
We need to have a wider answer to the question of 'how?'.
It is not enough to limit emissions in a group of countries that voluntarily agree to reductions, but which together account for just 30 per cent of emissions.
Neither is it sufficient to have solutions that are based only on restrictions in the most developed countries.
Even if the so-called Annex I countries were to reduce their emissions to zero, the rapidly growing emissions of the developing countries would still take us above the 2 °C target.
That is why we must discuss the financing of investments in the developing countries.
We need to ensure rapid technology transfer and we need to make sure that the developing countries also make commitments to check the development for which they are currently heading.
In addition, we will need clear commitments in the medium term for countries outside Europe too.
The responsibility of the few must now become the responsibility of all.
I know that the European Parliament will accept its responsibility.
The Swedish Presidency sees you as our allies.
We now want to write the story of how the climate threat was averted, and we want to write it together with you.
Mr President, honourable Members, the economic and financial crisis spread like wildfire around the world within the space of a few weeks.
Some people had given warnings, but for most people it came as a surprise - particularly its extent and depth.
In a global world, problems also spread quickly to others.
The force of the downturn is such that nobody has a miracle cure for getting out of it quickly.
Coordinated action on the part of the EU is the best tool we have to meet the challenges of the crisis.
Moreover, there is still much that can go wrong.
In the circumstances, the EU has succeeded in showing leadership through these testing times.
We agreed on guarantees and rules of the road for supporting the banks.
We agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy.
President Sarkozy and the French Presidency played an important part in this work, but I would also assert that the European Parliament was a driving force.
Now we need to devote the autumn to discussing continued measures to take us through the crisis.
The economic situation remains difficult, and public finances are now stretched in all the Member States.
According to the Commission's forecasts, the deficit within the EU will exceed 80 per cent of GDP next year.
We cannot close our eyes and pretend that it is not a problem.
In the middle of all this we must not forget either that behind these figures are people who are concerned about their jobs and who are wondering how they will manage to pay for their homes and to maintain their standard of living.
It is our task to answer them.
When millions of Europeans lose their jobs and become excluded, our entire welfare comes under threat, and this at a time when our welfare is already under great pressure.
We are living longer, while at the same time we are working less and having fewer children.
If this trend continues, in 50 years' time there will be twice as many older people as children in Europe.
So what can we do?
We must restore confidence in the financial markets.
We must quickly get effective supervision in place to prevent similar crises occurring in the future.
The Swedish Presidency will work towards agreement on this in the Council by the end of the year.
We are hoping for your help in achieving this quickly and conclusively.
Our citizens will not accept the repeated use of tax revenues to rescue financial institutions that have acted irresponsibly.
We must rapidly get ourselves out of the growing public deficits through a coordinated exit strategy and a gradual return to the rules of the Stability Pact.
Otherwise, short-term imbalances will be followed by chronic deficits.
Large cuts await us, as are already a reality in parts of the EU; and we have previous experience of this in Sweden.
Mass unemployment, social unrest and growing tax pressure then await us.
We must ensure a social dimension to European policy that is based on healthy public finances and on getting more people into the labour market.
This is by far the best way to safeguard our welfare system.
I know that this is an important matter not least here in the European Parliament.
It is unsustainable for three out of 10 Europeans of working age to be excluded from the labour market.
Our aim must be an active labour market policy that, together with well-functioning social security systems, is able to manage change effectively.
We must strengthen the individual's employability and ability to assert him- or herself in the labour market.
In addition, we must activate and reactivate the unemployed.
With more people in work there will be more support available for those who are not.
We must also concentrate on reforms, modernisation and adaptation to a new reality.
The world outside the EU is not standing still.
It is moving forward at a tremendous rate.
That is something we should acknowledge and accept.
A review of the EU's Lisbon strategy could contribute to a necessary reform agenda.
We will initiate this discussion in the autumn.
In the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism.
The WTO confirms that the number of trade-restricting measures has increased considerably in the past three months.
Consequently, I welcome the L'Aquila agreement on restarting the Doha round - in order to ensure that the countries of the world again take the free trade-friendly path that we know benefits us all in the long run.
The objective must be an EU that comes out of this crisis stronger.
Mr President, honourable Members, when I travel around Sweden and talk about EU cooperation, I get few questions about the institutions of the EU.
The questions instead tend to concern curved cucumbers, snuff and other everyday matters.
Nonetheless, the institutional framework is important because it defines what we can do and in which areas.
That is why the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is so central.
The Treaty will make the EU more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more influential in the international arena.
Most important of all, however, is the fact that having the Treaty of Lisbon in place will close the chapter on an inward-looking phase of EU cooperation.
It is now time for the EU to look outwards and forwards.
The Swedish Presidency is prepared to carry out all the preparatory work to ensure a smooth transition to a new Treaty, but naturally that requires the Treaty to have been ratified by all the Member States.
Let us hope that that becomes a reality in the months ahead.
International criminality is growing ever stronger.
Criminal networks no longer see their activities bounded by national borders.
We can see how the drugs trade and human trafficking are spreading.
This is a threat to our democratic values and a threat to our citizens.
At the same time, the freedom to move freely across borders is fundamental to our community - to study, work and live in another EU country.
New times call for new answers, however.
Consequently, this autumn we will draw up a new programme in this area that we will call the Stockholm Programme.
The Stockholm Programme will sharpen the instruments that create security in the EU and that fight organised crime and terrorism.
At the same time, we will create a better balance between these instruments and the measures that ensure legal certainty and that protect the rights of individuals.
It will also ensure that those seeking asylum in the EU face a common, legally certain system - with greater consistency in the way they are received and the way their case for asylum is examined and greater consistency as regards repatriation policy.
The dream of a future in Europe is a strong one for many people.
At the same time, the population of Europe is getting older and older.
A flexible system for labour immigration could bring together these two realities.
Mr President, honourable Members, just over 50 years ago six countries laid the foundation for European cooperation.
There are now 27 of us.
We have grown in strength and influence, and we have grown in prosperity and diversity.
Europe has been enriched.
As a result, we are also better equipped both to exploit the opportunities presented by globalisation and to meet its challenges.
Together we are strong.
We talk of membership 'negotiations'.
In the final event, however, membership is about sharing common values and following common rules.
This is currently being pondered on by those that remain outside - from Reykjavik to Ankara via the western Balkans.
The two leaders on Cyprus are facing a historical opportunity to agree a solution that will reunite the island that has been divided for far too long.
For those inside, there is a temptation to allow the membership process to become an opportunity to resolve long drawn out disputes.
In such cases we must find solutions that benefit both sides and open up the way ahead.
Otherwise we jeopardise our progress towards our aim of continued European integration.
The Swedish Presidency will work to advance the enlargement process in accordance with the commitments made by the EU, and strictly on the basis of the applicable criteria.
We will act as an 'honest broker'.
Mr President, honourable Members, with strength and influence comes an international responsibility that we are still striving to shoulder.
It is accompanied by a duty to use this responsibility in everyone's best interest.
The EU must work for peace, freedom, democracy and human rights.
We have a responsibility to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world, a responsibility to live up to the UN's Millennium Development Goals.
We also have a responsibility to support the work of the UN in other areas, to work together with our strategic partners, to become involved in the world's crisis hotspots - whether it is the peace process in the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea or the great challenges on the African continent.
However, we also have a responsibility for regional initiatives such as the Mediterranean Union and the eastern partnership that are creating stability and cooperation between neighbouring countries with different circumstances.
I am particularly grateful for the European Parliament's driving role where the Baltic Sea cooperation is concerned.
Parliament presented a draft strategy for the region back in 2005.
We now hope that this initiative can be crowned with the adoption of a Baltic Sea Strategy at the European Council meeting in October.
The conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s became the starting point for the EU's involvement as crisis manager - an involvement that is now continually growing.
Today the EU is involved in 10 or so crisis initiatives around the world.
These days the world's problems come knocking on the EU's door.
All around our world - and not least in the areas closest to us - many people's hope for their own development is linked to our cooperation.
Let us together meet their expectations.
(Applause)
Mr President, honourable Members, as a result of European cooperation, today our continent lives in peace and prosperity, in freedom and stability.
We have open borders and a social model that combines a market economy with consideration for each other.
This is our shared Europe.
Our citizens also want to know, however, that Europe is borne by ideas for the future and that our cooperation not only has a historical purpose but is also forward-looking.
That is why we, as their elected representatives, have a responsibility to say what we want to do with Europe.
Let me tell you how I see the Europe of the future.
I want to see a Europe that acts forcefully for democracy, peace, freedom and human rights in the international arena and which dares to act on the foreign policy stage.
For there are those among us with experience of what it is like to live without democracy and freedom, which gives us the credibility to act.
I want to see a Europe that takes the lead in the fight against climate threats, which resists the temptation to compete on the basis of an industry that does not pay for the emissions that are destroying our climate and which provides incentives that make green technology worthwhile, so that our children and our children's children get to experience nature as we know it.
I want to see a Europe that takes responsibility for the economy.
'Lending for spending' cannot be the only motto.
Neither can it be the case that 'profits are private and losses national'.
Let us build up our public finances again, regulate sound financial markets, and secure the economic reforms that we need for growth and for industry that will continue to be competitive in the future.
I want to see a Europe that develops its social model further, a Europe that combines a well-functioning welfare system with growth - with social cohesion, a Europe that through work, enterprise and healthy public finances creates room to maintain and develop our welfare models, in the best interests of all our citizens.
I want to see a Europe that does not allow itself to be lured by the short-term crusades of protectionism, a Europe that safeguards the internal market that formed the basis of our EU cooperation and that allows goods and services to flow freely across our borders, for the benefit of ourselves and of the rest of the world.
I want to see a Europe that is humbled by inequalities, that is open to the arguments of others and that has a strong will to find compromises, all to serve the common interest.
Such a Europe will be strong whatever the times.
(Applause)
Mr President, honourable Members, it is an honour for me to stand here with you and represent European democracy.
Many people have said to me that this will be the most difficult presidency for many years.
There are many challenges, and we must prepare for the unexpected.
Many ask whether a country the size of Sweden can shoulder this responsibility.
Not alone - but together we can face these challenges.
Let us do so with vision and drive, with initiative and courage.
Europe needs it.
The people of Europe need it.
The European project is about the dream of solving people's problems together.
This dream makes Europe strong.
This year, 2009, is a fateful year for European cooperation.
We have the chance to take the next step.
The Swedish Presidency is ready to take on the challenge.
Let us take it on together!
(Loud applause)
President of the Commission. - Mr President, these are no ordinary times and this will be no ordinary presidency.
In addition to the usual legislative work, the Swedish Presidency will have other kinds of highly political challenges to deal with, and no one better to tackle these challenges than Prime Minister Reinfeldt and the Swedish Presidency team.
Today I want to highlight two of the biggest policy challenges facing the European Union in the next six months: dealing with the economic crisis and negotiating an ambitious international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen.
The worst financial and economic crisis in living memory continues to have devastating effects within our communities and families, with unemployment in particular continuing to rise.
Getting the economy back on track remains the top priority.
The European Union's collective action has led to an unprecedented fiscal effort that is producing concrete results.
We have also shown solidarity amongst Member States, for instance by doubling the ceiling for balance of payments support for non-eurozone Member States to EUR 50 billion.
We now need to fully implement the recovery package in all its aspects and make sure it translates into the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic activity on the ground.
I believe it is essential to prioritise measures that limit unemployment and get people back to work.
Here we can build on the results of the employment summit held in May as part of a Commission initiative with the Czech, Swedish and Spanish Presidencies.
We need to put into practice the shared commitment to youth and to employment.
Of course, responsibility for labour market policies lies with Member States, but we can and should use existing European instruments to help Member States keep people in employment and train them for the jobs of the future.
That is why the European Commission is about to make a proposal to simplify Structural Fund procedures and waive the need for national cofinancing from the European Social Fund for 2009 and 2010.
We will also redeploy resources in order to fund a new microcredit facility for employment and social inclusion.
I hope this Parliament will support these proposals.
The Commission proposals building on the de Larosière report I commissioned last October will form the basis for strengthened financial market supervision and regulation.
With the proposals already made - many of them already approved by this Parliament and by the Council, some still in our decision-making process - we are indeed taking the lead globally in the reform of the financial international system.
We will continue to do so, I am sure, at the G20 in Pittsburgh in September.
Moving all these dossiers forward over the next six months is essential to build a new economy, because - let us make no mistake - the post-crisis economy cannot and will not be the same as the pre-crisis economy.
We need to rebuild our economic model and put the values back at the heart of our social market economy, where they belong.
We need to build an economy and a society based on opportunity, responsibility and solidarity, an economy which will have to reinvent new sources of growth because we cannot rely for ever on monetary and fiscal stimulus; a Europe of open and well-performing markets; a Europe of smart, green growth; a Europe with more effective regulation and supervision of financial markets; a Europe that deepens its single market and uses its potential to the full; a Europe that resists the trends for fragmentation or protectionism.
Concerning climate change, Europe is already the first region in the world to implement far-reaching, legally binding climate and energy targets.
I am proud of the way the Commission worked with the last Parliament and the Council to put this legislation in place, and I want to work closely with you and the Presidency in the run-up to Copenhagen.
Our leadership role was very much appreciated in the meetings last week in L'Aquila in the G8, and in the Major Economies Forum.
You will have heard about the progress made at these meetings.
For the first time, all participants committed to capping the temperature increase at 2°C to respect climate science.
This is certainly a welcome step forward, but we should not delude ourselves: our ambition and our commitment are not yet matched by others.
Europe is far ahead of the curve in relation to the rest of the world and, frankly, 145 days from Copenhagen, that worries me.
In the coming weeks we will step up our work with international partners to secure clear commitments in Copenhagen.
We also need to make progress on the necessary means to support developing countries and boost technology transfer.
In September the Commission will put its proposals for financing on the table so that we can build a European consensus and negotiate with others.
The climate change agenda is, of course, closely linked with another priority: energy security.
Today, the Commission will adopt proposals to strengthen our rules governing the security of gas supply and reinforcing solidarity between Member States, which I trust the Swedish Presidency will take forward with your support.
These are the headline priorities - and rightly so.
But there is plenty of other important work to be done over the next six months.
Let me just flag the Stockholm programme, where the Commission has recently tabled an ambitious vision putting the citizen at the heart of our justice, freedom and security policy, balancing security with the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights.
For most of this decade the European Union has been engaged in internal institutional debates.
Changes to our governing Treaty are absolutely necessary to equip the enlarged European Union to work democratically and effectively.
I hope that we will see the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in the coming months so that we can put its provisions to work and so that we can move on with the policy agenda I have just outlined.
It is important to discuss procedure, but I believe it is even more important to discuss substance.
The Swedish Presidency, as well as the next Spanish Presidency, will have to oversee - hopefully - a complex transition to the new Treaty in which the Commission and Parliament will have to play their full part.
The European Union has constantly reinvented itself, from the initial vocation of healing a war-torn continent to the building of the internal market and then on to the reunification of Europe.
During these last 50 years Europe has consistently exceeded expectations, confounding doubts.
I am sure that we will also rise to the new challenge we face: laying the foundations for the smart, green economy of the future.
We will succeed if we respect the key lesson from half a century of European integration: the European Union advances when all its parts cooperate in a spirit of openness, trust and partnership.
The Swedish Presidency programme recognises this; the European Commission stands ready to play its part and so, I am sure, does this Parliament.
(Applause)
Mr President, I do not usually address you, but for the first time today, I am going to devote one minute to you.
Firstly, Mr Buzek, I salute you as a man of resistance and as one of the founders of Solidarność, as the man from Silesia who never forgot his roots, his history or his values.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is also proud to have convinced the vast majority of MEPs from all political backgrounds - Mr Schulz included - to make you the spokesman for 500 million citizens.
Yes, Mr President, your election is the symbol of this open Europe, of this tolerant Europe, of this political Europe championed by the PPE Group and by the majority of our fellow Members here present.
President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, what we expect of you is that you will make action the dominant theme of the Swedish Presidency over the next six months - in other words, faced with the twin challenge of the economy and climate change, we are saying that we need to do more, and faster, in order to come out of the crisis, by bringing our social market economy model fully into operation.
I firmly believe that it is the vitality of the economy and that alone that will enable us to conduct the true social policy that we need.
If we want a recovery and if we want it to come from Europe and not from Asia, as is anticipated, then we absolutely must speed things up today.
When the crisis ends, the winners will be those who gambled on innovation, on training - in short, on action.
In this regard, the PPE Group proposes, among other things, to increase the support given to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are key to maintaining and creating jobs.
Furthermore, the economic crisis - I would insist on this point - requires not a national response but a European response.
Moreover, our fellow citizens are convinced of this, one need only look at the opinion polls in the various countries: more than 66% of Germans and more than 70% of Europeans are convinced.
To do more, and faster, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, that is also what the PPE Group expects of you where the fight against global warming is concerned.
It is the responsibility of Europe, under your leadership, to lead the world in this action, which everyone here recognises as being urgent and a priority.
And what better opportunity to act and to speed things up than the climate-change conference to be held in December in Copenhagen, in other words, on our own territory!
On the issue of climate change, Europe has proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that it can take action when it wants to.
The task now is to capitalise on this, to make the other world powers join us.
I am of course thinking of the United States, which must turn its words into deeds, but I am also thinking of the emerging countries, be it China, India or Brazil, which can no longer ignore the fact that they are heavily responsible for global warming.
We shall therefore judge the Swedish Presidency on the ways in which it copes with the crisis and in the light of its results regarding the environment.
I shall conclude by saying that, in order to act strongly on these two fronts, Europe must be equipped with appropriate institutions.
The last year has shown us that, with the same treaty and with the same outdated principle of unanimity, it was possible to make progress with Europe but that it was also possible to reach a deadlock.
It is a question of political will, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso.
Speed things up: that is what the PPE Group is asking you to do over the next six months, and we have faith in the Swedish Presidency.
Speed things up: that is what Europeans asked for in electing this Parliament and that is what we must give them if, in five years' time, we wish to see more of them turn out to vote.
(Applause)
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency comes at a time of new beginnings for the institutions.
It is not only this Parliament that is starting anew;
Europe is in a period of transition between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon, and - as we all know - it is a time of uncertainty in which we nevertheless need clarity with regard to economic, financial, labour market and climate policy decisions in the European Union and its Member States.
You have talked about this and I agree with much of what you said.
Climate change is, of course, the most important issue and you have given it the right level of priority.
It is, of course, also the case that the jobs crisis requires an immediate and relevant solution.
Therefore, we ask you during your Presidency to urge the Member States to take the investment plans and the economic recovery plans more seriously than they have done so far.
What we need above all is the safeguarding of jobs - now, not next year, as the threat to jobs is present here and now.
Job security is vital for the internal stability of society.
We therefore expect you to give the utmost priority to jobs and job security in whatever form, for example by combining environmental protection and industrial policy, which is a highly intelligent solution.
On the subject of job security, I would like to say this to you, Mr Reinfeldt: what seriously jeopardises jobs in Europe and is an even greater threat to social cohesion is the case law of the European Court of Justice.
As you have just said, you travel a lot in Sweden and in Europe.
So do we and what we hear from our citizens is that they do not want a Europe where companies move from country to country cutting wage levels.
We therefore need initiatives from the European Union.
(Applause)
We need these initiatives as a consequence of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in the Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxemburg cases.
These are measures that you - and you in particular, because Sweden is affected by this misguided policy, this misguided case law - need to tackle during your Presidency.
You also need to deal with another institutional issue, namely that of how the next Commission will be appointed.
In this regard, I have to say that to some extent I get the general impression that not only you, but also all of your colleagues in the Council have been affected by the new institutional beginnings and the uncertainty about which Treaty we should actually be using as the basis for our actions, and that no one really knows where we are.
It is a little bit like Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking in her Villa Villekulla - I will make the world the way I want it to be.
Wonderful!
If we appoint the President of the Commission on the basis of the Treaty of Nice, we will have 20 commissioners.
In that case, I would like to know which country will have no commissioner.
To this, the Council will naturally say 'no, we certainly do not want to start a bloodbath behind closed doors.
So, we have a wonderful solution - we will nominate the commissioner initially on the basis of the Treaty of Nice.
It will take a couple of months for the Commission to be set up and by then the people of Ireland will have voted and we will have the Treaty of Lisbon.
Then we can vote on everything else on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Great!'
We are a community based on law - or at least that is what I thought until now - in which the basis is the law in force.
The law in force is the Treaty of Nice.
Incidentally, there is someone who, as guardian of the Treaties, must first of all clarify which legal basis is to be used.
That is the President of the Commission, but I have not heard a word from him on this matter.
I would therefore like to state very clearly what we are expecting.
My proposal, Prime Minister, was that you should not take the formalisation decision straight away, but first send your candidate to Parliament so that he can tell us what he wants to do to restore the economy, safeguard jobs, combat climate change, introduce an employment pact, an initiative for a public services directive and an initiative to improve the Posting of Workers Directive and establish a guarantee between the Commission and Parliament regarding an evaluation of the social consequences of the Commission initiatives.
We could have already discussed everything with the candidate weeks ago to see whether he would receive a majority vote in this House on the basis of his proposals.
Then you could have made a decision regarding formalisation.
However, you took a different route.
You said 'no we will take the formalisation decision first and then send the candidate'.
I fear that this was another error and I also fear that this candidate, unless he makes a considerable effort, will not receive a majority vote in this House.
(Applause)
I would like to make this very clear so that what will probably be the biggest contentious issue during your Presidency is perfectly clear between us right from the start.
We expect institutional clarity, we expect socio-political commitment, and I believe that we will be with you with regard to climate policy.
Mr President, just for you I have kept to my speaking time exactly.
You will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up.
You will not need to reprimand me - I knew that that was what you intended to do and I did not want to give you that pleasure.
(Applause)
Mr President, firstly I should like to say to Mr Reinfeldt that our Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will fully support the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, that is to say, the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we naturally expect to be implemented quickly and in full; the preparation for the climate-change summit in Copenhagen, which has already been mentioned and which is a priority that we fully support; and, lastly, the Stockholm Agenda.
Furthermore, and this is the subject of my speech, Mr Reinfeldt, I should like to refer to an issue that is addressed in every speech in this House - the fight against the economic and financial crisis - in order to say to you that you are assuming the leadership of the European Council at a very precise moment in time.
It is a good thing that it is Sweden that is chairing the Council because you have specific experience in this area.
In the 1990s Sweden experienced exactly the same economic crisis that we are experiencing now throughout Europe and the world.
You have experienced a crisis in the real estate sector.
In the 1990s you also experienced a financial crisis, and you resolved all these problems by directly tackling the problems in the financial sector.
My message to you is that you must act in exactly the same way today at European level because that is what we are lacking.
We are trying to combat the economic and financial crises using 27 different approaches in the various countries, and that will never work.
We expect you, Mr Reinfeldt, to use the experience you gained in Sweden, because it was a success, unlike in Japan, which has been economically stagnant for a long time.
Sweden came out of the crisis because you immediately tackled the problems in the financial sector, something which is not being done for the time being in Europe.
The thinking is that the United Kingdom can nationalise the banks while others - France, in particular - can recapitalise them.
In Germany, work is under way to create 'bad banks'; in the Benelux countries a bit of everything is being done at the same time.
The result is that there is no single approach.
The United States is stabilising its banks and eliminating the toxic products while we continue to have problems.
My request to you, therefore, is to take advantage of your experience in order to present a single rescue plan for Europe's financial sector, which will form the basis of the economic recovery.
Without it, there will never be an economic recovery; the banks will not starting lending money again, and so on.
This must be your absolute priority.
The second point is that we hope that you, together with the Commission, can also present a new recovery plan, because 27 different recovery plans will not produce the necessary results in the coming years.
It is absolutely essential that the Council and the Commission together take the lead in this.
I know there are now 27 recovery plans at national level, but we see a number of protectionist measures inside those national plans.
It is your responsibility, Mr Reinfeldt, to say to your colleagues that a better way to deal with this is, together with the Commission, to devise one single recovery plan and to invest in sustainable energy and in the new economy.
I think that, with your experience in Sweden during the 1990s, you are the right man in the right place to do what we have not done so far: devise a single strategy in the European Union to combat this economic and financial crisis.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, my fellow Member Mr Schulz said everything there is to say about the institutional concerns that my group has had for a long time with regard to the forthcoming election of the President of the Commission.
We agree with what he said.
We want the whole of the Commission and all of the top-level staff of the European Union to be elected according to the conditions of the Treaty of Lisbon and we will not give an inch on that.
However, Mr Barroso, I would like to take the opportunity to explain the political reasons behind my group's doubts and its belief that you are not capable from a political point of view of doing what we feel to be necessary in the current situation in Europe.
Take, for example, the frequently mentioned need for the new regulation of financial markets.
We have had G8 summits, G20 summits, extended G8 summits, European summits.
How far have we come?
If we look at the picture today and draw a comparison with the game of Monopoly that we are all familiar with, the banks have been re-established, they have passed 'go' and did not go to jail, they have taken hundreds of millions with public approval and then simply started the game again.
I do not think that people are being doom-mongers when they say that as a result of this the next crash is inevitable.
Mr Barroso, what happened to your forceful intervention?
Where are your genuine results?
We have seen no evidence of them.
(Applause)
As regards climate policy, you know that during our entire European campaign we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have advocated the Green New Deal.
We are absolutely convinced that it is utterly wrong to do what you have repeatedly done in the last five years, Mr Barroso, and that is to play economic strategies off against environmental and climate strategies.
We believe this to be very much rooted in the past and it must stop.
We need to think about economic development in a sustainable way and we must bring climate protection targets into line with environmental targets.
That will benefit the economy and will create hundreds of thousands or even millions of jobs.
Mr Piebalgs has demonstrated once again that this is the case in the energy sector in his study over recent months.
In our experience, Mr Barroso, you are not in a position to set forth this Green New Deal.
In summary, I can only say that, with regard to climate protection, Europeans have been conspicuous on the international stage in recent months as a result of their new-found hesitation - how far do we really want to go with the reduction targets? - and new tight-fistedness, and that, unfortunately, also applies to Sweden.
The establishment of the International Climate Protection Fund for the poorer countries has gone extremely badly.
The fact that it is still a secret that the Swedes want to take money from the development pots, for example, to put into this climate protection pot - that is a zero sum game and, from the point of view of the poorer countries, it is totally unacceptable.
We must quickly put an end to this new tight-fistedness and new hesitancy in the European Union.
(Applause)
Finally, Mr Reinfeldt, I can say something positive.
We are prepared to tussle with you over the new definition of the Lisbon strategy and to work with you on this.
You have said you will do this by the end of the year.
We will help you in this.
We will also support you if you wish to do more with regard to Eastern Europe and Russia, but the focus on a genuine climate policy must not merely be a matter of headlines, it must also be corrected in the small print of the Swedish programme.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like first of all to offer my sincere congratulations on yesterday's election, the election of a splendid president - the new head of Parliament.
I do this, as you very well know, Mr President, as a Polish politician, but also as a person.
You know that it was thanks to you that I met my wife, and that is still the greatest achievement of my life.
Congratulations, and I wish you much success in your work.
The European Conservatives and Reformists Group listened carefully to your speech, Prime Minister, and I am glad to be able to say that we share your views on very many matters.
I consider your announcement of active measures to tackle the crisis to be especially important.
The economic crisis, which is the worst crisis our civilisation has experienced since the 1930s, is causing unjustified anxiety throughout Europe - in poorer countries and in richer, in countries of the north and of the south.
I am glad that you have announced an active fight against this crisis, and I am glad that you can see priorities which we also share - more freedom for the market, less regulation, more economic freedom, greater openness to free trade.
These are a recipe for the economic growth of our continent, of our European Union.
Prime Minister, we also share your conviction that dealing with climate change is an important matter.
I know that you have bold views on this subject, and I want to encourage you to be bold in this area.
The issue of climate change shows very clearly that today we live not only in a single Europe, but in a single world, where the threats are shared by all and must be dealt with effectively.
I am very glad that you referred to the fight against crime as a serious problem of our European Union.
I am convinced that, because Sweden is already a powerful force in the area of crime novels, we will also achieve success under your leadership in the area of the fight against crime.
It is extremely important, and I am glad that both you and your Minister for Foreign Affairs have mentioned recently that you want to look carefully at our neighbours and take what I hope will be a sympathetic view of the idea of enlargement of the EU.
We must not forget that across the eastern borders of the EU there are countries which are entitled to be part of the area of democracy and affluence which we are in today.
I regret to say that there is just one point on which my group is not in agreement with you.
This is the question of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.
You spoke about democracy in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon - and you were right to do so.
It should be remembered that it was in a democratic referendum that the people of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon.
Since we have respect for democracy, we should respect the vote of the Irish people.
Prime Minister, I hope that your priorities, which in very large measure are shared by the ECR Group, will prove to be an opportunity which enables you to lead the European Union effectively and to deal effectively with the crisis, which is today our greatest problem.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency.
Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing.
Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy.
The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis.
They are innocent parties.
Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis.
I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers.
Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism.
We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia.
We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament.
The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers.
Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy.
This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars.
Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place.
The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures.
We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries.
We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment.
I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency emphasised issues that concern our fellow citizens, our electorate, namely the environment and climate change, the financial crisis, the safeguarding of jobs and the fight against crime, because, in order to do a good job, we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us.
We are no better or worse than our electorate, but I do believe that it is important to act in accordance with what they are asking of us, and these points seem to me to be along the lines that I mentioned.
Moving on, we must, of course, turn the proposals into concrete action, and here we will come up against one another above all in the codecision procedure, since we, Parliament, and you, the Council, will lay down those rules that will govern the lives, affairs and interests of our electorate, and I believe that that is our fundamental task as legislators.
We must overcome the crisis of confidence that undoubtedly exists.
The poor turnout at the elections of this Parliament is a symptom of this, and to overcome it, we must act fully in accordance with the will of our electorate.
We must also perhaps avoid making comparisons: your country borders Norway;
They are outside the European Union, but they live well all the same; they have the same problems, but they are no worse off than us, and here it is important to see and to demonstrate that it is worth having the European Union.
I believe that this is a great challenge but I also believe that, with everyone's help, we can show that Europe should not be suffered, but should be an opportunity for those who live there and are citizens of it.
(NL) The Dutch Party for Freedom has come into this Parliament in order to stand up for Dutch citizens and in order to wrest back the money that has been overpaid by the Netherlands to this cash-guzzling and bureaucratic Europe.
The Party for Freedom was elected to this Parliament by Dutch voters to make it clear that Dutch citizens believe that the enlargement of the European Union has already gone far too far.
Mr President, this Parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the Member States themselves.
As far as our party is concerned, the European Union should only be involved in matters relating to economic and monetary cooperation.
It is with Dutch interests to the fore that we will keep our eyes on the Swedish Presidency, as it is doing nothing for Dutch citizens.
You want to just press ahead with the European Constitution, which Dutch voters rejected and which is 99% identical to the Treaty of Lisbon.
You also fail to do anything about the immensely costly monthly relocation from Brussels to Strasbourg.
What is more, you have not even put the matter on the agenda.
Why not?
It costs thousands of millions of euros and the only people who like the idea are perhaps those at Ikea, who get the chance to sell moving boxes and extra cupboards.
We also want to see the negotiations with Turkey brought to an immediate end.
Turkey is an Islamic country and the Islamic ideology is completely at odds with our Western culture.
Turkey is, furthermore, absolutely not a European country, but an Asian one, while Turkish membership would cost Dutch citizens sacks full of money yet again.
Turkey can be a good neighbour, but it does not belong within the European family.
The Party for Freedom stands for a Europe of sovereign states, but further building work towards a federal superstate where the Member States get to determine less and less of their own affairs is taking place under the Swedish Presidency.
We therefore hope that the people of Ireland will have the courage to vote 'no', once again, to the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Irish population has the opportunity, here, to act as the voice of the people of Europe, and I would like to ask you, on behalf of the Party for Freedom, what conclusions the Swedish Presidency will draw from the result of the Irish referendum.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, allow me first to congratulate you all collectively on having been elected as group leaders.
I know that a number of you were elected with very strong support.
I know, for example, that Martin Schulz was re-elected with very strong support in the social democrat group.
It is important to be able to represent your respective groups strongly.
I very much welcomed the dialogue that we have had and the consultations which I was asked to introduce by the European Council during the month of June.
This was done by EU Minister Cecilia Malmström.
I also did it myself, both through telephone contacts and at the meeting that we had on a boat in the archipelago as we moved through the waters of Stockholm, sitting and discussing the situation that had arisen.
I had been asked to investigate the possibility of electing José Manuel Barroso, appointed by the European Council, as president of the Commission for a second period of office.
A number of the matters that you touched upon are the main issues that I want to work on during the Swedish Presidency.
Let me say that we are putting jobs first.
We want to see a Europe in which more people have work.
The discussion must start from how we achieve this.
Just as Joseph Daul pointed out, I believe it is a matter of innovation and training; in other words, the things that basically drive enterprise and make people employable.
I believe that Martin Schulz is right that we must be wary of ending up a Europe in which we compete on the basis of poor terms.
We are having this discussion in Sweden, and it is also taking place around Europe.
Having low or no pay is not a good starting point from which to try to face the competition; rather, it is only with good conditions that we can face the competition of the future.
Allow me to mention some other things that I believe are very important for steering Europe through the crisis.
I have seen how the Commission - and I myself think this is important - has managed to defend the principle of the internal market at a time when many are attempting to compromise it and bring in protectionism.
It is very easy to listen to those who are saying 'Why did you not save the jobs in this particular country?' without seeing the consequences of this if everyone acted in this way.
If we did, we would basically extinguish free trade and the opportunity for cross-border trade.
That which has basically created wealth and prosperity would very quickly be lost had we not resisted the call for protectionism.
I believe that safeguarding the internal market and free movement is an important starting point for securing jobs.
I also have great faith in other things mentioned by some of you, such as investing in human skills and ensuring mobility in the labour market.
I believe, for example, that one way to manage this is precisely this free movement - including across borders.
Just as Martin Schultz, Rebecca Harms and Joseph Daul mentioned, I believe that this is also an opportunity to combat this with a green trend, to bring about the low emission economies that we are talking about all over the world as another way of getting out of the crisis.
How we manage financing and how we invest are important.
I also want to say - I agree with Guy Verhofstadt on this point - that the Swedish experience of crisis management in the 1990s was that it can only be done by keeping a grip on public finances.
I have learnt that when deficits are large and rationalisation is called for, it is people with small margins and those that are most dependent on welfare institutions who are left behind.
Consequently, a policy that is prudent with public finances is a good policy for people who are poor or living on small margins.
Where the climate issue is concerned - which will be the main issue we work on ahead of the Copenhagen summit - I want to say that it is true that there is still a lot to do.
Time is short.
I want to tell Rebecca Harms that it is unusual for us in Sweden to be criticised for our aid commitments.
The average spent in Europe on such commitments is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product.
Sweden is fairly unique in that one per cent of our gross domestic product goes to development aid.
For me, these matters are related.
We carried out our own review under the leadership of our aid minister within the framework of the UN's initiatives.
During this we analysed precisely how we need to bear climate change in mind in our development work.
You cannot carry on development work without at the same time looking at climate change and how it is already affecting poor parts of the earth.
Consequently, we cannot separate these issues and say that this is development policy and that is climate policy - rather they are related and have to work together.
Where the Treaty is concerned, I would like to say to Martin Schulz that my role is to ensure that there is effective European leadership in a difficult period.
We must be able to give answers to the citizens who want to see us take action to combat the financial crisis and on climate issues.
We are all politically active and know that in the political domain, when we are inward-looking and discuss names and leadership our citizens perceive this as us having turned our backs on them.
We are looking inwards.
Therefore I will do what I can in my role.
I have been tasked by the European Council with ensuring that our cooperation and our respect for the integrity of the European Parliament are united by clarity - whether under the Treaty of Nice or the Treaty of Lisbon - in our nomination of a candidate to the post of Commission President.
Where José Manuel Barroso is concerned, it is important to state that he was unanimously supported in the European Council, that he was well known as a candidate and had already been introduced to the electorate prior to the election.
Naturally, that made it easier for me to act - naturally respecting the fact that the European Parliament will be given opportunity, when you feel ready to make a decision, to say yes or no to the candidate nominated by the European Council.
Meanwhile there is time for discussions, which I know José Manuel Barroso has also stated, and to have this type of dialogue concerning how European policy is to develop in the years ahead.
I hope that this can now be agreed in accordance with the agreement that has been made.
It is what the electorate of Europe now expects, and will enable us to act together with strength.
Mr President, some important questions have been asked; I shall try to answer them very briefly.
Firstly, Mr Schulz's important question regarding the treaties.
He referred, in particular, to the Commission's role as guardian of the treaties.
We in the Commission believe that there should be respect for the treaties in force.
The treaty in force is the Treaty of Nice.
All of you who are sitting here were elected under the Treaty of Nice.
Obviously, if the President of the Commission is elected now, he will be elected as you were, under the Treaty of Nice.
That being said, we are going to have - I hope - the Treaty of Lisbon.
The necessary adjustments will have to be made as regards the composition of Parliament, which will no longer be the same with the Treaty of Lisbon, since there will be certain changes, and the same will have to be done for the Commission.
Nonetheless, the European Council adhered to every aspect of your report - the Dehaene report - which was adopted by an overwhelming majority.
On the subject of the European Council, before formalising its decision, it carried out consultations, which also took into account - and this is a real first - the result of the European elections, not to mention the fact that there had been a candidate supported by a political force.
The task now is to gain the approval of the European Parliament.
I should like to repeat today what I have already said in a letter sent to the President of the European Parliament: I am ready to discuss the content of the guidelines for the next Commission with any political group that wishes to discuss them.
In any case, that is my position as regards institutional matters.
On a political level, I should like to stress a very important point.
I believe that it is important to link the election of the President of the Commission to the democratic election that has taken place, your election.
You have been elected by virtue of the Treaty of Nice, and it is my view that the President of the Commission should also have this legitimacy, which should in a way result from this democratic election.
Furthermore, in view of the economic and financial crisis - and I believe that those who are in favour of a strong Europe and who want a strong Commission will no doubt agree - the matter of Presidency of the Commission should not be left unresolved now pending the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we all want - at least the majority of us do - when we do not know when that treaty will come into force.
Leaving the European Commission and its Presidency in a state of suspense when there is an economic crisis, a financial crisis and a social crisis, and when we have very important negotiations ahead of us in Copenhagen, does not seem very wise to me.
Be that as it may, it is up to the European Parliament to decide, and I am ready to enter into a democratic debate as, in fact, I did five years ago.
On the second question about finance and the economy and what Mr Verhofstadt said: we can all have more ambition, and on that matter let me tell you that I share your ambition.
But we cannot say that we did not adopt a European economic recovery plan, and that was the maximum that our Member States accepted.
The European Commission proposed more, but that was what our Member States accepted.
I want to draw your attention to the fact that some Member States - no less influential at the beginning of this crisis - suggested not to have a coordination plan.
Some others suggested a fiscal stimulus of 1%, and the European Commission came immediately to the proposal of 1.5%, and in fact the automatic stabilisers were around 5%.
Apart from that, we took those important decisions in terms of balance-of-payment support to some non-euro-area members and also some initiatives at global level.
So you may count on the Commission to do everything we can do to reinforce the European level and a common approach, let us have no ambiguity about it.
But, also, let us be honest with ourselves: we are not the United States of America - we are not an integrated nation state - so of course we have different situations.
You cannot ask Germany and Latvia to do the same thing.
We have countries in Europe that are under balance-of-payment support, so of course we cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach.
We have to have a common approach but with specific national responses, because that is the reality we are facing in European and will face in the near future.
We have mainly national budgets.
So I share your approach to have a more coordinated European plan, namely to get out of this crisis and to build this kind of smart green growth we want; but at the same time we have to accept that we have 27 national budgets, we have 27 finance ministers, we have 27 national banks apart from our European Central Bank, and it is very important to reinforce the euro and to have economic policies and financial policies that are sustainable.
If not, we will put the euro, one of the great successes of European integration, at risk.
Finally, on the question of climate change, once again we can always have more ambition.
But for me it was very important that Prime Minister Reinfeldt was with me recently in L'Aquila, when we heard the Secretary-General of the United Nations say: 'You are the locomotive of the world'.
We can always have more ambition, but the European Union is leading the fight against climate change in the world.
No one is being more ambitious than we are, so of course I would expect at least a word of recognition in terms of the work done by this Commission, together with our Member States, to put forward ambitious proposals.
Let us now try to convince others, because we need others - because the problem of climate change is not just a European problem, it is a problem for our planet.
With your support I believe we can achieve success at the Copenhagen Conference.
(Applause)
(SV) Mr President, as a Swede it is with pride that I listen to the Swedish Presidency's priorities and I am also proud to be able to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden back here again.
The challenges we face are very substantial.
We have 20 years of fantastic, miraculous change in Europe behind us, and as a result we now have one of the early representatives of the Solidarność movement for freedom as president of the European Parliament.
It is ideals such as democracy, freedom, the rule of law and the market economy that have given us 20 years of fantastic development.
We are now living in a time of change with a new treaty, the climate issue which demands a consistent policy capable of global impact, and the economic crisis.
It is therefore important that we have a presidency, but also a parliament, that is capable of ensuring that we get stability as regards public finances, stability as regards the internal market and stability as regards openness to trade and movement across borders that can help to take us out of the crisis.
I would like to take this perspective one step further.
The decisions for which we are now preparing the way through the Swedish Presidency and in this Parliament will also decide the form that Europe and the European Union will take after the crisis - what dynamics we have in the financial markets and what confidence and credibility they enjoy, and what room we have for innovation and enterprise, for investments and new jobs.
If the elections to the European Parliament showed one thing, it is that the citizens of Europe want less bureaucracy and regulation and greater openness - across the borders and out to the world.
It is this openness that will be crucial to Europe's ability to be a leading force for the values that 20 years ago began to change Europe, and to which we can also contribute out in the world.
(Applause)
(SV) Mr President, I would first like to thank the Swedish Prime Minister for his presentation of what he and his government want to do in the coming six months.
We know that we are in a tough starting position; the crisis is deep.
It is about jobs, it is about dramatically growing chasms, it is about a generation of young people who are going straight into unemployment and of course it is about the environmental and climate crisis.
This has also been described by Prime Minister Reinfeldt, but it is the conclusions that are surprising.
What has been highlighted as the central issue for the Swedish Presidency is not jobs or investments, but rather the Member States' ability to maintain budgetary discipline.
As we approach 27 million unemployed in the EU, the clearest message from the Swedish Presidency is thus: budgetary discipline.
This is not only wrong, but also worrying.
In this area Mr Reinfeldt's party - contrary to what has been said here earlier - comes with some hefty historical domestic policy baggage.
The last conservative Swedish Government led Sweden into economic disintegration, and it was a social democratic government that had to devote 10 years to sorting out our public finances.
However, we cannot allow old shortcomings in domestic policy to set the agenda for the whole of the EU at a time of serious crisis.
What is needed is major investments in jobs, training and green change - not putting anorexic economies on a diet by means of budgetary discipline.
John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has also expressed concern that the social dimension of the Swedish Presidency has been given such low priority.
Mostly fine words, says Mr Monks, very little in the way of real plans.
My group shares these concerns, and they also include the trade union rights of workers, as Martin Schulz stated in his speech.
Workers' terms have deteriorated following the Laval judgment and following the Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg judgments.
Their rights have been weakened.
What I and my group want from the Swedish Presidency is a definite commitment that the EU's workers will have their full trade union rights restored.
Trade union rights must take precedence over free movement.
That must be extremely clear.
We do not want to live in a Europe in which the crisis is met with budgetary discipline and with confrontation.
Is this matter even on the agenda, I would like to ask the new president, Prime Minister Reinfeldt.
(FR) Mr President, we are faced with two issues.
The first issue is the crisis.
As everyone knows, we need a consistent and common response to the economic and social crisis and thus a European recovery plan to increase investments and to support employment.
Europe really must show today that it is more attentive and closer to our fellow citizens when it comes to the difficulties they are facing.
It must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis.
From that perspective, the situation is urgent.
The second issue is finally that of the new development model that must come out of the end of the crisis.
It must be a simpler, fairer and more sustainable model, which ensures that finance serves the real economy, which develops new forms of solidarity among Europeans, which takes account of the social and environmental challenges in international trade, and which radically reforms our relations with the world's poorest countries, and here I am thinking specifically of Africa.
In addition to these two major issues there is a democratic requirement that concerns the process for which you, the Swedish Presidency, are responsible.
Cecilia Malmström - whom I am pleased to welcome today - knows better than anyone that there are some very important differences between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon where the appointment procedure is concerned: a simple majority on one hand, and a qualified majority on the other; an appointment on one hand, and a nomination on the other; and a different number of commissioners depending on the treaty.
For my part I am really asking you to ensure that the spirit and the letter of the treaties are respected.
This falls under your remit, and it is very important for the credibility of our institutions.
Thank you in advance.
(SV) Mr President, congratulations on your appointment.
I would first like to commend the government for having a genuine commitment to the Baltic Sea and I hope that we will make progress here.
You also have remarkably good rhetoric on climate change.
What I am now looking for, of course, is for this rhetoric to be put into practice.
You often say that Europe and Sweden account for only a small part of the world's emissions, but if the EU Member States are home to just eight per cent of the world's population and account for 30 per cent of emissions, then it is also our responsibility to take a large part of the climate work seriously.
It is here that I find the concrete information lacking.
How are you going to deal with the IPPC Directive on industrial emissions?
How are you going to deal with illegal felling?
How are you going to deal with energy efficiency standards for buildings and how are you going to deal with the fact that aircraft cannot continue with their emissions while at the same time avoiding paying the EUR 14 billion in energy tax that they should pay?
Then I would also like to bring up the Stockholm Programme and Acta.
Where Acta is concerned, we must ensure that there is openness here.
The German constitutional court has said that the countries must have more influence, that the parliaments must have more influence.
We need openness in the Acta negotiations.
We cannot move towards supervision unilaterally.
The same applies to my hometown and the Stockholm Programme.
Let it become a name that is associated with the EU's transition from terror paranoia to human freedoms and rights and with a strengthening of asylum law and the protection of privacy.
Then we will have made progress.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for prioritising economic challenges.
Whilst we have economic uncertainty, our ability to face any of our other challenges is obviously diminished.
You are right to prioritise the need to restore public finances: the extraordinarily high levels of public debt pose great and long-term threats that, unless we face up to them now, may be with us for many decades.
But restoring health to financial institutions is also key to regaining the confidence of consumers and returning economic growth, let alone taxpayers' money.
In your priorities you discuss the importance of the supervisory framework.
I would add that regulatory clarity is vital.
These industries are, as we all know, global industries.
The capital, the talent and the individual enterprises are highly fluid.
They need workable and defined legislative timetables, prioritisation of legislation and proper consultation.
I welcome your commitment to work alongside the G20, because if we get out of step and go unilateral in the EU we risk not only putting borrowers and investors at a competitive disadvantage but also causing industries to relocate outside...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
(SV) Mr President, firstly of course I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as president and at the same time thank you for the interesting exchange of views that we had during the election period.
Prime Minister and fellow Members, thank you for your account of the Presidency's programme.
I am convinced that in organisational terms the Swedish Presidency will be a great success and that it will be taken care of truly excellently by the competent Swedish state administration.
Politically, I naturally share the Presidency's opinion of the two major crises - the economic crisis and the climate crisis - and of course these are the priority issues.
However, where is the analysis?
The economic crisis and the climate crisis were not predestined by fate.
The crises have their origin in political decisions made.
This is a positive thing, because it means that we can also solve the crises through political decisions - but I see no sign of a change to different policies from the Presidency.
It is the same economic policy that takes no account of social or environmental considerations.
What I and many of our citizens are looking for in the programme is workers' rights, which have come into focus following the court rulings, and social issues, where no answers are forthcoming.
Neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy.
Where the Stockholm Programme is concerned, it is said that it will create security, but in practice what is emerging is a 'big brother' state that threatens personal privacy.
We can never accept restrictions on asylum rights or restrictions on our rights as free citizens in this programme.
We need a humane asylum and immigration policy.
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sweden has always respected human rights and democracy.
Some time ago the Swedish people voted against the euro, and you have respected that decision, although you yourself were strongly in favour.
That is why it is rather odd that Ireland should now promptly have to vote once again on exactly the same treaty.
It is the Nordic and the Swedish way to respect the voice of the people.
I wish you luck and success in the challenge that you now face.
I hope that you will respect the values of the best sort of Nordic democracy: not through compulsion but through cooperation.
I am very pleased that you mentioned the Baltic Sea, and I fully support you in this matter.
The Baltic Sea is in difficulties; it is dying and it needs to be saved.
The Northern Dimension has been missing in all this, however, and I hope that you will do a lot to promote it, although you made no mention of it.
(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy.
We need bold democrats and in this new period we urgently need an exciting, democratic and genuinely effective Europe.
Creative artists and, in particular, freelance writers, will have a role in identifying the values of this new Europe.
Their uncensored imagination will be able to put the bureaucratic genie which aims to destroy democracy back in its bottle.
After all, it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change.
Those who can offer visions of hope which allow them to get inside people's minds - the Swedes have been particularly good at this in the past, and in this respect I have every confidence in my former colleague Cecilia Malmström - can also inspire their interest in socio-political matters.
This is how I deliberately worded the final paragraph of my new book at the beginning of this last election campaign, which brought about major changes and which is linked to a great deal of hope that you in particular from Sweden with your great democratic tradition and transparency will now recognise the signs of the times.
We are not only facing the economic crisis - and here the Swedes have shown their cleverness by largely avoiding it - but we also have to deal with a rather ominous swing to the right.
I therefore firmly believe that together we democrats must stand up for genuine transparency and in particular we must stand together in the fight against the extreme right.
(NL) My heartfelt thanks for the ambitious plans that you have laid out for the coming six months.
I can tell you that we have high expectations of you, as you have had the reputation right from the very beginning of having gone into bat for European integration and for our European values.
It is important that the solutions that we put forward and that you are working on to get us out of this economic crisis reinforce our social market economy.
It is also important that these solutions do not only benefit our citizens today and tomorrow, but also provide for our children's future.
It is therefore so very important to continue to build towards a sustainable economy and towards preventing climate change.
It is good that you give such a high priority to this in your programme.
I sincerely hope that your efforts in these areas help to bring the Member States closer together and that, in the run-up to the Copenhagen Conference, you also manage to induce the biggest players on the world stage to really play their part in finding a solution to climate change.
Mr President, the social market economy is also important when it comes to sustainable government finances, since government deficits form a burden for future generations.
It is therefore important to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and it is also good that you have said so expressly.
Mr President, it is ironic, but the financial crisis has brought Iceland closer to the European Union.
I hope that the Swedish Presidency is welcoming towards Iceland, but that it is also strict in ensuring that Iceland complies with the requirements for accession and that it meets the obligations relating to European legislation and towards the Member States.
(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, I hope you will allow me in this connection to speak in particular to Carl Bildt, because I would firstly like to touch on the subject of enlargement, particularly in the Balkans.
You mentioned that this enlargement process will be slower than many people on both sides would have wished.
However, it is very important to give clear signals.
What I expect from the Swedish Presidency is help in particular for the people in south eastern Europe to overcome the problems they are facing there - including the intergovernmental problems - so that they can feel hopeful that the road to Europe will not be blocked off, but that progress can continue to be made, even if it perhaps takes a little longer.
However, the appropriate preparations must naturally be made by these countries.
Secondly, I would like to refer to another subject that you mentioned, namely the issue of restructuring the economy and the linking of economic policy and the environment.
It has already been said that you have our full support in this.
I believe that this is an important task for Europe.
It is true that in this regard we are very much at the forefront, but we still have a lot to do.
At the same time, unemployment is also rising.
The level of unemployment that we are seeing today in Europe has not yet reached its maximum.
It will, unfortunately, get even worse.
It is therefore extremely important to mention the other dimension, the social dimension, as we will only receive broad support for the green restructuring of the economy if people feel that their social needs and requirements are also being taken seriously.
The Nordic countries in particular have a lot of good examples of an active labour market policy.
We are not able, either as the EU or as individual Member States, to create jobs, but we can help people who have lost their jobs to find work again as quickly as possible.
That is what we mean by a social Europe - this active labour market policy that we need in the individual Member States, which the European Union and the Council in particular must give out a clear message about.
The green restructuring of the economy will ultimately result in lower, not higher, unemployment.
This is what we are calling for.
(SV) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, good to see you here!
There are many challenges in these turbulent times: a severe economic recession, the uncertainty as regards the Treaty of Lisbon and the negotiations ahead of the climate conference in Copenhagen.
You have a lot on your plate.
Prime Minister, a few important points.
You also have to convince your colleagues on the Council that protectionism is an abomination.
The strength of the EU lies in its open borders and free trade.
State subsidies to rescue the car industry are not the solution.
The financial crisis cries out for a new global order, but the regulations must be balanced and must not be excessive.
This autumn, as some here have mentioned, the EU must come a bit closer to a respectable asylum policy.
The energy policy, just as some have said, requires both realism and solidarity.
No new gas crises, no unilateral dependence.
The Internet was an important issue in the election campaign.
Here Sweden has a great responsibility to bring what is known as the Telecoms package to a successful conclusion.
The rule of law must also apply in the virtual world.
I had hoped that during this session Parliament would approve the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for a new five-year period.
Now this will not be the case, and I am sorry for that.
Now is not the time for the EU to spend its time on institutional power struggles.
Now is the time for political leadership and drive.
The euro has proved its strength.
When does the Prime Minister think that we in Sweden will be prepared to become full EU members and have the euro in our pockets too?
Thank you, and as we say in my party: good luck!
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sweden now has a huge responsibility for the future of the human race.
Prime Minister Reinfeldt, you spoke quite rightly of the climate crisis.
We know that the technology we need over the decades to come exists, and that it is available at a fair price, but the most problematic issue is that climate protection is an incredible challenge to human cooperation.
Unfortunately, the negotiations that are currently going on are more like a combination of hide-and-seek and a competition in self-congratulation.
The European Union must have the courage to put forward a proposal regarding not just the EU's own emission reductions, but the principle of burden-sharing, where all industrialised countries accomplish emission reductions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines.
The most important thing is that we achieve the emission reduction targets for 2020.
Secondly, it needs to be realised that the developing countries will not be able to adjust to a system of adequate emission limits unless we assist them financially at a completely new level, and the EU should be in a position to make proposals on that too.
(PL) Prime Minister, we listened to your speech with great care and would like to express the hope that the most important points of the programme will be put into effect successfully.
I would like, however, to draw attention to three challenges.
The first of these is European solidarity, which is especially important at a time of financial crisis.
We cannot allow situations to arise in which particular European countries are treated unequally.
We cannot accept a situation in which some are allowed to subsidise their banking sector and others are condemned for attempting to strengthen their shipbuilding sector.
That is not solidarity, that is hypocrisy.
Secondly, we are glad that the Baltic Sea Strategy is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency.
This is an important area of macroregional cooperation.
The Baltic ecosystem should be protected from hazards such as the very unsafe, and also financially absurd, Nord Stream project.
The need for diversification of energy sources should also be mentioned.
Thirdly, let us remember that Moscow does not restrict itself to turning off the tap, as Georgia discovered.
I hope that, as Sweden takes the helm of the European Union for the next six months, it will be as resolute as Minister Carl Bildt, who condemned the Russian aggression against Georgia.
I am sure that the Swedish Presidency will be equal to these challenges.
It can count on our support.
(DA) Mr President, there are two things that struck me when I read the Swedish Presidency's work programme.
The first thing is all the promises about how the EU will be used to create a better economy for solving climate and other problems, but there is not a single word about the problems that the EU creates - the problems that the EU has created in our labour markets, the problems that the EU has created in our fisheries sector, in our economy, in connection with the fight against crime and I could go on.
This is the first key observation we can make when reading the Swedish Presidency's work programme - that the EU only represents solutions and that the EU is not a problem.
This says more about the Swedish Presidency than it says about the EU.
The second thing is that there is no mention of the fact that 2 October will be one of the most significant days in the entire history of the EU, and this will be during the term of the Swedish Presidency.
I am, of course, referring to the second referendum.
There is not a word about what the Swedish Presidency will do to ensure that the so-called guarantees that have been given to the Irish people will also be regarded as such.
We have seen before how people have been deceived - deceived over referendums and deceived over democracy.
What will the Swedish Presidency do to ensure that this does not happen again?
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to welcome the Swedes and also offer my congratulations that they - as the Prime Minister said - have finally found their way to Europe after a long process.
We are very pleased to find that Swedes today are among the best Europeans.
You have presented your programme and it is very ambitious.
However, I would like to ask you to consider whether Sweden would have the courage to take the step, particularly after the experience of the financial market crisis, of joining the euro - especially as you said that the Stability and Growth Pact must be complied with.
You, of course, have no opt-out clause like the United Kingdom and Denmark, for example, and you meet all of the conditions now.
Will you have the courage during your Presidency to stabilise Europe further and become a member of the euro zone?
Prime Minister, I agree with your prioritising of climate policy and the Baltic Sea Strategy, but with regard to your programme in its written form, I have a request: please pay more attention than proposed to combating the financial market crisis.
None of the other projects will have a chance if the crisis in the financial markets and in the economy is not resolved as quickly as possible.
For this we need clear rules.
It is not enough for the City of London once again to determine the course.
We need clear rules in the social market economy, because a market economy without rules cannot operate and will not receive majority support.
Therefore, you should consider once again - although we fully support your programme - whether you should not give the subject of overcoming the financial market crisis higher priority than you have done so far.
Thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval.
(Applause)
(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, we have all listened to the Swedish Presidency's programme with great interest and appreciation.
Its clear priorities are the economy and energy, because the European Union's priority is to help restart the economy and generate employment, curb unemployment and ensure that the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009 is a success.
However, I would like to draw attention to a political, civic and democratic objective, which is to replace the Hague Programme with the programme that will be named after the Swedish capital: Stockholm.
The programme combines the achievements of the area of freedom, security and justice over the last five years, which have been very significant in terms of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the principle of trust in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection, but also in relation to active cooperation.
I invite you to be ambitious in this area: firstly, from a substantive point of view, as in all areas related to managing external borders, immigration, asylum, refugees and combating illegal trafficking, organised crime and terrorism it is easy to drift towards reactionary positions that contradict the acquis of fundamental rights that should set the European Union apart and which Sweden identifies with so much, as a country that respects transparency and democratic principles.
Secondly, I invite you to also be ambitious in terms of the form, because the Swedish Presidency is most probably going to clear the way for Lisbon, which firstly means that there will no longer be that double procedural framework of the third and first pillars, which is often confusing.
However, and most significantly, it will also mean that Parliament will have greater capacity to monitor the legislative initiatives that the Swedish Presidency implements as part of the Stockholm Programme.
This means that what has so far often been seen as a deficiency of Brussels or of the Council will also be the responsibility of Parliament.
(SV) Mr President, naturally I am very pleased and proud to see my government in the Swedish Presidency and I also think that the programme contains a lot that is good as regards solutions for the climate, jobs, the financial crisis, the Copenhagen Conference, the Baltic Sea Strategy, Community policy, enlargement, Iceland, Croatia, Turkey, etc.
However, I can see another matter that is important for the future: namely open Europe, privacy and freedom of expression.
Today the ministers are meeting in Stockholm to discuss the Stockholm Programme.
What is good is that this is the strategy for the legislation that is now to be drawn up.
Parts of the proposal have been long awaited.
Ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights will finally take place, I hope - the rights of the child and of the victims of crime.
We can make something really good come of this, but there are also downsides; namely the threat to the open society that the Stockholm Programme contains.
Threats to our open society must be fought off using the methods of the open society.
Some of what is contained in the Stockholm Programme is not liberal, and neither is it humane or far-sighted.
Registering our travel, the mass storage of personal details and the systematic charting of economic transactions is not liberal, nor is it tolerant or far-sighted.
Let Stockholm stand for openness, freedom and tolerance, not registration, supervision and intolerance.
Furthermore, I believe that our work in Strasbourg must be discontinued.
Before giving the floor to Mr Stolojan, I should like to welcome a guest of ours, a child who is sitting in seat 505.
It gives me particular pleasure to see children taking an interest in European issues and in our institutions because it is important to grow up as Europeans from an early age.
(RO) I wish the Swedish Presidency every success and I believe that the priorities set out are those we have been expecting.
The next six months are crucial for Europe's citizens and for the European Union.
They are crucial in terms of whether our countries are going to emerge from the economic crisis next year or whether, on the other hand, a large question mark will continue to hang over the economy for another year.
Many proposals and new programmes are being put forward.
However, I think it is time for us to assess the impact which the economy recovery programme launched by the European Commission at the start of the year is having, if any at all, and for us to take a close look at the European Union's budget for this year to see which activities have stopped and what resources we can continue to use to come up with new measures.
We also have investment projects planned for the energy sector which have already been approved from that amount of around EUR 3 billion.
We will have to take specific measures to implement these projects.
I would like to thank President Barroso for his particular contribution to getting the Nabucco project off the ground.
Finally, I would like you to remember the European Union's political commitment to other countries also successfully joining the European Union.
Mr President, we will not overcome the deep financial, economic and jobs crisis - or climate change - as independent, protectionist nation states.
Without Europe and the euro we are sunk as a continent, but neither can we continue as a union as though nothing was wrong except a few greedy bankers: budgeting discipline will not solve the problem.
The system is broken and must be deeply reformed.
Already the financial institutions are resisting the regulations we need to prevent a future meltdown.
We need more integration of our social and economic and climate and energy policies, with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions.
We need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in December.
We need, more than ever now, a recommitment to the Millennium Development Goals and, more immediately, Mr President-in-Office, I regret you did not call for an immediate lifting of the siege of Gaza or indicate any wish to re-energise the search for peace alongside President Obama.
As a Member from Ireland, I would like to remind the House that political irony is a trait much appreciated in Ireland.
Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels, once proposed to the British Government that the way of solving poverty in Ireland was to encourage us to eat our babies.
Well, I do not think the historical irony of the United Kingdom Independence Party proposing to come to Ireland to campaign for the independence of the United Kingdom from the European Union will be lost on the people of Ireland as a subject for a good belly laugh.
It will be something to see Mr Nigel Farage, dressed in his Union Jack and leprechaun hat, arm in arm with Gerry Adams, the former leader of the IRA, and Joe Higgins, my colleague up here in the back, calling for a 'no' vote on the Lisbon Treaty, each with their own lemming-like contradictory agendas.
I am confident the Irish people will tell this particular circus what they told Libertas: get lost!
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President, the programme of the Swedish Presidency does indeed include all the important issues which have to do with our times, both present and future.
I shall start with the recession.
I assume that the Swedish Presidency will need to go into this issue in greater depth.
The social market economy needs investments in the real economy and not simply in financial products such as those which put us in the situation we are in today.
The issue of climate and sustainable development, which also includes social development, and the issue of work, are obviously extremely important issues.
However, here too real investment is needed in the economy, together with more control.
A market economy which tries to move towards a laisser faire - laisser passer approach is not what we need in Europe.
The issues of crime, home affairs and justice truly concern us all.
Organised crime certainly is no longer what it once was and it certainly has links with terrorism and every form of illegal activity.
It therefore requires a differentiated approach.
I think what is most important is that we also examine, in relation to the large number of immigrants from third countries, whether the European Union's development policy really did succeed and on which points; in other words, we need a real evaluation and to examine what could or should have been changed in order for illegal immigration to be dealt with in the right way, because we are actually dealing with people and not just political or administrative acts.
The programme of the Swedish Presidency is truly very ambitious, especially, among other things, on trans-Atlantic dialogue.
However, on this issue too we must examine whether it is expedient for the European Union to be concerned solely with development and for the United States to be concerned solely with security.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of Estonia, one of Sweden's neighbours, with which it is connected through the Baltic Sea, I would like to draw attention to one of the Presidency's priorities, namely the Baltic Sea Strategy.
The strategy that was initiated with the active participation of my Social Democrat colleague from the previous parliament, current Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, is very important for the whole of Europe, and I would like to thank the Presidency for making this a priority.
This is also a good example of how initiatives proposed by Members of Parliament can achieve concrete results.
I would like to call upon the Swedish Presidency to implement the Baltic Sea Strategy, for which there is now a rare opportunity.
In order to do this, we must provide funding for the currently empty budget line in the EU budget.
I hope the strategy is passed in the European Council during the Swedish Presidency.
There are two other areas that are important to me: as a former Minister of Finance, I consider dealing with the economic crisis and the implementation of transparency in the financial sector to be of great importance...
(LV) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, firstly I would like to congratulate the Swedish Government on the objectives it has set out for its presidency.
This is not an easy time for Europe; it is full of challenges.
Of the many important priorities that Sweden has set out for its presidency, I would like to draw attention to the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region, and particularly that part of it relating to energy market security.
Joint security for Europe's energy market will not be possible so long as divided and mutually isolated markets exist in Europe, both in electricity and in gas.
For historical reasons, this problem is particularly pronounced in the Baltic Sea region.
In order to resolve this problem and spread the risk relating to energy supply, we need a common European Union energy policy.
The foundation stones of such a policy must be not only energy efficiency and renewable resources, but also the creation of a common electricity and gas market with operational interconnections.
The European Union's strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a step in the right direction.
Its aim is to gradually connect up the energy markets in the region, overcoming deficiencies in interconnections and creating common market mechanisms.
The legacy of the Soviet Union occupation in the Baltic Sea region is a split and partially isolated market, which increases our energy supply risk.
Our challenge for the future is to change this situation, and by doing so boost our joint energy security.
I wish the Swedish Presidency luck in making an energetic start on this important task.
Thank you for your attention.
(SV) Mr President, Prime Minister, if we are to get a good international climate agreement we must also listen to other countries.
If we do so we will realise that firstly what is required is that the EU and other countries take greater responsibility for reducing our emissions at home, and secondly that the EU and other industrialised countries state in concrete terms how we will contribute economically to the climate work of poorer countries.
The fact that up to now the Swedish Government has worked against this has unfortunately undermined the opportunities to get a good agreement in Copenhagen.
The Council of Ministers must also realise this, and I would therefore ask two questions.
Is the Swedish Presidency prepared to contribute to a good international climate agreement by making a greater part of the EU's cuts in emissions on home soil?
When does it intend presenting specific proposals to finance the climate work of poor countries?
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its historic opportunity to steer the EU toward implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.
I would like to make three points.
First, it is of extreme importance to have the new Commission made operational as soon as possible.
Institutional uncertainty cannot be used as an excuse to delay the formation of the new Commission.
These arguments sound really hypocritical.
To come out of the economic crisis and to create new jobs, we need more than ever a strong, independent and innovative Commission.
Second, I would like to commend the Swedish Presidency on taking the lead in the implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy, which was initiated by the European Parliament.
However, there is also a special budget line for this strategy which is still empty.
We cannot expect a positive change in the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea by relying only on ad hoc projects.
We certainly need also coordinated support from the EU budget.
Third, for Estonia the Stockholm programme is important.
It should also include a programme for using modern IT.
I am wondering whether the establishment of an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice would be of help in implementing this strategy.
(SV) Mr President, congratulations on your appointment.
I would also like to thank Fredrik Reinfeldt for an extraordinary review and report.
We all now expect great achievements in Copenhagen, although it must also be emphasised that this is to be an international event.
Expectations have really been raised, but I dare say that if not all the groups are satisfied with the result then it will not be the end of the world.
Naturally the economic crisis has been highlighted here.
The big groups, the big companies always get attention.
I would like to emphasise that the small loyal subcontractors should not be forgotten either when financial matters are under discussion.
I would also like to underline the specific values of the Baltic Sea Strategy.
I believe that the Baltic Sea Strategy could increase the legitimacy of the entire EU.
Europe's largest inland sea can and must be saved.
The Baltic Sea Strategy can also help to check the crime trend and trafficking.
This is also an important environmental issue that you could say demands its own Copenhagen Conference.
I am pleased that the work on a border solution between Croatia and Slovenia is on the agenda and that the Cyprus question is also being resolved.
We are all anxious to see this.
We will also, I believe, gradually see the Nordic region enlarged here in the EU to include Iceland and, I imagine, also Norway within the not too distant future.
President Barack Obama gave an extraordinary speech about Africa in Africa the other day.
I have reason to stress that Sweden can be proud of its work and I hope that we can continue to hold the flag of solidarity high in the future.
(NL) I think that we and the European project stand at a real crossroads.
The Treaty of Lisbon, the Copenhagen climate conference and a vigorous approach to tackling the financial and economic crisis are the three great issues that you will have to deal with over the coming six months, and if we can bring them to a successful conclusion, Europe really could take a quantum leap forwards.
You are no doubt aware that a large majority of MEPs are ready to lend their backing to this route and I would like to urge you, with a quip, to leave the critics and the barking dogs to make their racket on the sidelines.
Let them not distract you from your mission, your purpose.
I believe that we must concentrate on the essentials.
Allow me to point out just one issue, Prime Minister Reinfeldt.
It is crucial that we concentrate on one of the top priorities, namely an aggressive plan for the future of the automotive industry in the European Union.
In my opinion, we have not had such a plan up to now, or at least we have had too little of one, and I think that you would agree with us there.
It is definitely not too late.
The rescue plan for Opel is in full swing and the world, and even Europe, is not rid of the demons of protectionism.
They are slumbering beneath the surface, and Swedish society is just as affected as we in Belgium are, just as they are in France, Germany and Slovakia.
We are all in the same boat.
What is needed is for us to approach this in solidarity with one another, with a coordinated, rather than an 'every man for himself' approach, and that we do not attempt to clip each others' wings.
Mr President, I think that you have a unique opportunity here to work with the President of the Commission - this also sends a clear signal to the Commission - to draw up a joint plan, a joint plan, Mr Barroso, for the future of our car factories, thereby steering them into the 21st century.
We believe that the energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly car can be realised in Europe's existing car assembly factories and we are counting on you, Mr Barroso and Mr Reinfeldt, being on our side.
(HU) In our view, Sweden is synonymous with Europe.
This country is the home of prosperity, security and freedom, where the issues of human rights and freedoms are just as important as economic and climate change concerns.
Then we have the parliament of an EU Member State which adopted a language law on 30 June 2009 stipulating that if anyone, including all of you, does not call that country's capital city by its name in the country's official language, Bratislava, but uses its German name, Presburg, or Hungarian name, Pozsony, they may very well end up paying a fine of EUR 5 000.
The explanatory memorandum to the language law amendment states that protection of the national language in certain cases overrides the freedom of speech and right to privacy.
A European Union which adopts such a law is no longer a Europe of freedom.
I ask the Swedish Presidency to do its utmost to ensure that this law is repealed and that the Slovak head of state does not sign it.
(HU) I would like to draw your attention to two of the Swedish Presidency's priorities which I was delighted to see on this list.
The first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia.
I think that the importance of this issue is particularly underlined by the fact that we saw how evident the level of support was for the far right in several European countries during the European Parliament elections.
This therefore makes it the responsibility of every one of us, including Parliament and the current Presidency, to ensure that the most vulnerable do not end up in a precarious situation.
In particular, we must do everything to ensure that there is no cooperation between those parties professing to be democratic and the extremist parties.
A very good example of this is the Slovak language law, mentioned already today on several occasions, which is severely discriminatory, as was described.
The second priority which I would like to welcome is the series of European measures to be adopted, aimed at the integration of Roma communities.
(PL) Mr President, continuation of enlargement of the European Union and the future of the Treaty of Lisbon are among the objectives of the Swedish Presidency.
The German Constitutional Tribunal ruled recently that the Treaty of Lisbon can be accepted only on condition that the precedence of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat are safeguarded, which calls into question the idea of European federalism.
The Treaty of Lisbon has, therefore, turned out to be a legal monster, which has been noticed not only by the Germans, but also by the Irish in a referendum and by the Presidents of the Czech Republic and Poland.
In this context the Swedish Presidency should initiate a Europe-wide debate on the subject of the role of the national parliaments of all the 27 Member States, and should develop a new model of cooperation between sovereign European nations.
It is, therefore, to be hoped that the Swedish Presidency, which I wish much success, will listen with greater attention to the voice of the citizens.
(MT) I would also like to laud Prime Minister Reinfeld for staying with us until the very end of this discussion.
We will be looking to the Presidency to implement three important priorities.
The first is the Stockholm Programme on the area of justice, freedom and security.
We have to ensure that agreement is reached on this programme as soon as possible.
The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum.
We will be looking to you Prime Minister to ensure that you will implement the Pact that was agreed upon last year.
Thirdly, last month, during the European Council, agreement was reached regarding the pilot project on burden sharing in the field of immigration.
You have a great deal of work ahead of you Prime Minister, and we, together with our President, will be monitoring you closely to guarantee that this work is carried out.
(PT) Since Dag Hammarskjöld, Sweden has distinguished itself as a member of the United Nations (UN).
It therefore knows that, without bodies with universally recognised legitimacy and representativeness, there will be no political force to conclude Kyoto2, the Doha Round or the Millennium Development Goals, or to regulate the global economy, not to mention defend human rights.
It is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the G20.
It is tragic that the EU - this locomotive of the world according to Mr Barroso, who was citing the UN Secretary-General - is leaderless and lacking in any strategic vision in this area, at a time when President Obama is proclaiming his commitment to global governance.
Instead, on our side, we have only heard the Pope insisting on the urgent need to reorganise the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods Institutions.
Mr President, why is the Swedish Presidency refusing to lead Europe into forcing reform of the UN Security Council, by demanding a seat at the table for the European Union with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon?
(GA) Mr President, the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, which will be held in Ireland on the second day of October this year, will be one of the most important events to occur during the period of the Swedish Presidency.
Ireland has received legal guarantees in a range of policy areas and this is helping greatly to alleviate the concerns that the people of Ireland had in the referendum last year.
Now, it is incumbent on those of us who believe that a vote in favour of the Treaty will be to the benefit of Ireland to work to progress this new arrangement in my country.
If the Treaty of Lisbon succeeds - and I hope that the referendum will be passed - the various countries will be able to nominate a member to the Commission.
Those in favour of the Treaty cannot afford to be complacent in any way.
We must do our utmost to ensure its success.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, I would very much like to thank Prime Minister Reinfeld for including in his priorities the need to develop cooperation with our Eastern neighbours.
I would also like to thank him for Sweden's engagement in development of the Eastern Partnership.
In this context I would like to point out that in the next six months, we as the European Union and Sweden as the Presidency will have to face up to problems relating to the disregard of human rights in Belarus.
For six months now, three entrepreneurs, Mr Avtukhowich, Mr Leonov and Mr Osipienko, have been held in detention and have not been able to obtain a just verdict.
Of 12 young activists who took part in a demonstration in January 2008, 11 were given custodial sentences, and several days ago one was sentenced to a year in prison.
Prime Minister, in the next six months please pay attention to the question of breaches of human rights in Belarus.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, I hope I can return a little of the time I borrowed earlier.
(The President briefly cut off the speaker)
I know that you are waiting for a vote.
Allow me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well.
I note your eagerness and the expectations that there are of the Swedish Presidency, your desire for us to be more of a driving force in climate negotiations and to take action to combat the financial crisis and economic recession.
You have noted our Baltic Sea Strategy, our Stockholm Programme, our continued efforts to drive forward the matter of enlargement, and I would like to thank you all for the support we are experiencing in this.
I also know that the transition to the Treaty of Lisbon will mean that we meet again, and that we have a great deal to do together this autumn.
A number of the ministers in my cabinet are here with me today.
We have noted and carefully followed your questions and views.
I hope that we will cooperate closely and I hope to see you again in the autumn.
We also count on constant discussion and keeping in contact with the Presidency.
It is very important for the European Parliament.
It is the beginning of our term of office and we must do many things, and this is a very good starting point: the Swedish Presidency.
Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
I would also like to thank the President of the European Commission.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I welcome the Swedish Presidency's proposal to focus on questions of policy instead of constitutional questions during its presidency.
However, the Council has decided to ignore the democratically expressed will of the Irish people, and they have made a decision to force the Treaty of Lisbon through.
Unfortunately, the policy framework that they are pursuing is the same failed agenda of deregulation and liberalisation.
This is not the appropriate response to the economic crisis.
The complete opposite is the case, namely that it is a continuation of the same policies that instigated the crisis, and it is these same policies that are being further strengthened in the Treaty of Lisbon.
We are told that we need the Treaty of Lisbon because it has been long years in the making.
But the Treaty of Lisbon was drafted and agreed before the economic crisis, and is based on policies that helped to ignite the crisis.
To force through those outdated policies now would be disastrous, for it would make the crisis worse.
There is a need for new policies for a new era.
There is a need for a new Treaty for a new era.
As far as climate change is concerned, it is important that the Swedish Presidency does its best to achieve a robust deal in Copenhagen.
in writing. - The incoming Swedish Presidency has many challenges but the greatest is the need to ensure that the EU respects the sovereignty of the Member States and does not ride roughshod over the democratic rights of the peoples of Europe.
Far too often the concerns and interests of our peoples are ignored in the headlong rush to advance the federalist agenda exemplified in the Lisbon Treaty.
Looking to changes ahead, the preparations for the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013 will be an issue during this Presidency.
The voice of areas heavily dependent on farming, like Northern Ireland, must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy.
We have a great duty to help and protect our constituents at this time of great financial turbulence.
The EU must not put further obstacles in the way of economic growth and stability.
in writing. - (PT) The anti-social programme of the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union represents a dangerous step forward in the expansion of neoliberal policies.
It reflects the relentless pursuit of these policies, despite all the evidence, by the leaders of capitalism in the European Union, who are forgetting that their policies are the main cause of the economic and social crisis.
Although, in the presentation of its programme, the Swedish Presidency did refer to people and the problems of unemployment, it did not mention a single measure to change the existing policies which have caused these problems.
Quite the contrary.
In particular it highlighted the policy of free competition in the widest range of areas, including in services and foreign trade.
It has gambled everything on the recovery of the financial markets, on the resumption of the paradigms of the Stability Pact and on the defence of neoliberalism, which will certainly result in new attacks on social and labour rights.
It also did not forget to insist on a new referendum in Ireland on the draft Treaty of Lisbon, already planned for 2 October, in a continuation of the blackmail of the Irish people in order to move forward more quickly with the destruction of public services and the reduction of social rights, including in the areas of social security, health, water, social protection and workers' rights.
It is not difficult to predict that it will submit new proposals for directives, which will try to adopt the same lines as those proposals that were rejected in the previous legislative term.
I welcome the incoming Presidency and would like to express the hope that as the third member of the Council troika, Sweden will continue the work which was started during the Czech and French Presidencies in the area of Roma social integration.
There were many factors which hampered the outgoing Czech Presidency's work, but the overall picture in terms of Roma issues is nevertheless positive.
In fact, the Roma Platform held its first meeting in April in Prague, while, in June, the European Council strengthened its general objectives in terms of offering Roma equal opportunities by calling on the Commission and Member States to combat the poverty and social exclusion affecting Roma.
In the same document the Council adopted the common basic principles set out in Prague for achieving Roma social integration, with a call to public policy-makers to take these principles into consideration and comply with them.
Based on the results achieved by the troika so far, I hope that the Swedish Presidency will at least focus greater attention than before on Roma issues.
For example, I hope that the forthcoming conference on the inclusive labour market to be held in October and the Equal Opportunities Summit due to take place in November will deal with the issue of Europe's largest minority as a main priority.
Indeed, in terms of population size, it is considerably larger than the population living in the Baltic region, designated as a priority by this Presidency.
I also hope that the Swedish Presidency will go beyond the theoretical approaches already adopted and the organisational issues decided and start to take specific actions, thereby actually putting these frameworks into practice.
The Stockholm Programme, which is a priority for the Swedish Presidency, must provide support in reinforcing the area of freedom, security and justice, as well as in promoting economic activity during the current crisis, especially in view of the possibility of the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force.
The success of the Stockholm Programme will help make Europe more accessible to its citizens.
This success will be reflected in the enforcement of the right of freedom of movement for all European citizens and the comprehensive implementation of the mutual recognition principle in civil and criminal matters at EU level.
The Swedish Presidency must continue the efforts of the French and Czech Presidencies, whose priorities were to provide all workers in the EU with complete access to the Community's labour market, a freedom which is most symbolic of European citizenship.
In order to do this, Member States must actively participate through concrete actions in abolishing the virtual borders inside the EU which are detrimental to citizens' freedom of movement, as they encounter administrative and legal difficulties when they live and work in another Member State.
The freedom of movement must be a reality for all EU citizens, especially during a time of economic crisis, which highlights the need to promote unrestricted mobility among the workforce.
This mobility can be self-regulating and ensure flexibility, as well as reduce the amount of undeclared work and the natural unemployment rate.
The EU is facing huge challenges nowadays: the economic and financial crisis, the alarming rise in unemployment and climate change.
The unemployment rate in the EU is 8.9% at the moment, while 19% of young people under the age of 16 and 19% of elderly people are exposed to the risk of poverty.
People are losing their jobs, many businesses are going bankrupt, while national budgets are in major deficit.
The EU's Swedish Presidency has a huge responsibility towards its citizens.
It must restore their hope of a decent living and lay the foundations for economic recovery by getting everyone to pull together.
Such measures as increasing energy efficiency, using energy from renewable sources and improving the EU's energy security feature among the Swedish Presidency's priorities.
I hope that the EU's Swedish Presidency will mark the start of an age of prosperity, guaranteeing a period of economic growth for the next 40-50 years.
I believe that, now more than ever, we need to invest in education, research, energy efficiency and, above all, in people.
Sweden is renowned for its social policies and high standard of living.
This is why I would like, along with my fellow Members in the European Parliament and every citizen in Europe, to wish you every success, and we hope that this term will provide the springboard to a new future.
in writing. - (EL) The priorities of the Swedish Presidency mark an escalation in the anti-grassroots attack by the EU, the aim of which is to safeguard the ongoing profitability of euro-unifying capital by shifting the burden of the capitalist recession on to the working class and grassroots classes.
The Swedish Presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
At the epicentre of this anti-labour attack are wage and pension cuts, the complete demolition of labour relations, workers' rights and social protection and insurance systems and even greater commercialisation of health and education.
The 'green economy' is being designed so that, on the pretext of combating climate change, new profitable sectors of activity can be opened up for capital.
The Stockholm programme is endeavouring, in the name of combating terrorism and organised crime, to reinforce the bourgeois political system still further, so that they can combat grassroots reactions and step up repressive measures against immigrants.
The strategy on the Baltic has paved the way for a more aggressive approach by the euro-unifying monopolies in the countries on the eastern borders of the ΕU, in a bid to strengthen their position in the imperialist competition.
Using 'guarantees' as a smoke screen and blatant coercion, they are trying to grab the Irish vote in order to implement the anti-grassroots Treaty of Lisbon.

Announcement by the President
(After the speech by Mrs Harms, see item 4.1).
Yes, Mrs Harms.
Regarding the matter that you have just mentioned, I must inform the House that President Buzek has made a public statement, which I will read to you.
It is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted earlier today in Grozny.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.
Natalia Estemirova was a human rights activist and a leading researcher, with Memorial, on Chechnya.
In 2005 she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the EPP Group in the European Parliament.
We in the European Parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights, promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law.
We strongly call on the authorities of the Russian Federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and to do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to justice.
The European Parliament is at the forefront of promoting democracy, implementing the rule of law and defending human rights.
It is, therefore, our obligation to support and show our solidarity with all those who struggle everywhere in the world for the same values, as was the case with Natalia Estemirova.
(Applause)
Ms Harms, the Presidency agrees with your proposal to hold a minute's silence in memory of Natalia Estemirova.
(The House observed a minute's silence)
Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
We shall now proceed to the speeches, which must not last longer than one minute.
There is a very long list of requests.
This shows a great desire to participate, which is to the credit of this House.
However, I will be unable to give the floor to all those who wish to speak, because 100 requests would take an hour and a half, whereas we have only 30 minutes available.
(GA) Mr President, since this is my first opportunity to speak in Parliament, I would like to begin in my native language.
As you know, the campaign for the Lisbon referendum is well underway in Ireland at the moment, and we are hopeful that there will be a positive result on 2 October.
One of the things that is making a big difference this time round is the guarantees the European Union gave to the Irish Government in relation to tax, abortion and defence.
The new capacity for sports included in the Treaty of Lisbon, something which was not mentioned at all last time round, is also very important.
As one who has been involved in sport all my life at different levels of playing and administration, I believe that the possibility under Lisbon of the EU taking sports seriously and supporting both indigenous and international sports has struck a chord with the Irish sporting public.
For that reason, and for the other more obvious reasons such as the health, social and physical benefits of sport, it is imperative that substantial funding is provided post-Lisbon to ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Mr President, I believe that there are certain disparities within Romania's agriculture sector in terms of structural problems, compared with other Member States.
I must emphasise that the European Union should use the political and economic leverage it has to focus more attention on the management of the funds allocated for agriculture to those Member States who have joined later.
I wish to express my view that supporting a sustainable agricultural sector with an appropriate budget after 2013 as well would solve this problem, offering farmers medium and long-term prospects, along with sufficient funds so that Romanian agriculture can come into line with European standards and create an opportunity for a united Europe.
(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, Hungary and the Hungarian minorities are constantly bringing up the issue of national minorities.
Through recourse to half-truths and sometimes even lies, they try to manipulate European public opinion in their favour.
What is the truth?
Over the past eighty years, national minorities in Hungary have been all but wiped out, while Europe looked on in silence.
The Slovak minority has also been cut down from 300 000 to 10 000 members.
The size of the Hungarian minorities in surrounding countries, including Slovakia, has remained constant.
Over the past two years, six Roma citizens have been murdered in Hungary and dozens have been seriously wounded.
There are fears of attacks against Jews, while other forms of extremism are on the increase and are spilling across Hungary's borders.
This aggression is not being handled properly in Hungary and it must be condemned.
European institutions should take a stronger approach to these manifestations of extremism.
(PT) The coup that took place in Honduras on 28 June was an outrage against the Honduran people's freedom of political expression and most basic democratic rights.
Since then, the de facto government has adopted repressive measures against the grassroots movement that has been demonstrating in the streets and has introduced a regime of media blackout, restriction of freedoms, persecution, illegal detentions, disappearances and even murders of members of the organised resistance to the coup.
We were able to witness all that during the recent visit of a delegation from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left to Honduras and Nicaragua, where we met the legitimate president of the country, Manuel Zelaya.
The European institutions' reaction to these circumstances is ambiguous to say the least.
While some are unacceptably silent, others are appealing to both sides to do everything in their power to reach a political solution as swiftly as possible, treating things that are different as if they were the same and ignoring who is to blame, as if there were not a democratically elected president on one side and an illegal government on the other, which detained him and expelled him from the country when it unlawfully seized power.
The most basic respect for democracy requires the European institutions to issue a firm and forceful condemnation of the coup and to implement measures at an international level to increase pressure on the illegal government in power and isolate it.
They must also not recognise or support any elections that are held before democratic legality is restored in the country.
Mr President, as a new Member of this Parliament, I believe that one of the major issues facing farmers in Wales and the rest of the UK is the proposed electronic identification of sheep, which will come into effect on 1 January 2010.
The fact is that the scanning equipment to be used is not accurate.
My understanding is that it is only 79% accurate, which will cause major problems for farmers throughout the UK.
I urge the Commission to rethink this policy and only bring it in on a voluntary basis.
My fear is that many farmers will be penalised due to inaccurate equipment and that their single farm payments will be reduced.
In the worst case scenarios, the reduction could be 100%.
The concessions that have already been made are helpful but are not enough.
I find it quite astonishing that the Commission wants to bring in electronic identification (EID) with such huge flaws in the equipment.
The sensible way forward would be for EID to be introduced only on a voluntary basis from next January.
I urge Members of this Parliament to support me on this vital issue for the farming industry throughout Europe.
Mr President, I would like to call on this Parliament to take immediate and effective steps to save the small and family farmers in new Member States, especially eastern and central European Member States, and, in particular, my own country, Hungary.
What has happened to these farmers?
As a result of joining the European Union we had to 'offer', so to speak, 100% of our markets and, in exchange, we received 25% of subsidies.
This is not just unfair and unjust, but also illegal: this was a clear violation of the Treaty of Rome.
Now, as these farmers have been trying to compete in these unjust and illegal circumstances, they had to take loans - huge loans - to be competitive.
Now they have become bankrupt, and they have to sell their lands under circumstances of colonialisation where we have to open our lands for countries that have 10 times more GDP than we do.
I call for immediate reconsideration of the Copenhagen Agreement.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(RO) Mr President, just like other fellow Members, I would have liked to raise a problem from the agricultural sector.
However, a recent article published in the Wall Street Journal attracted my attention in particular, and this is why I am making it a duty of honour to present this article to Parliament and to put forward the requests made by its authors.
The title of the article, which I feel is sufficient to be able to understand what it is about, was: 'Mr Barroso, Take Down Small Business Walls'.
This article is nothing other than an appeal to the future European Commission to focus, at the heart of its actions, on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, which are very vulnerable during a crisis, and not to compromise in any way on implementing the 2008 Small Business Act.
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that these measures are implemented properly and efficiently because they are needed by the 20 million plus small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union.
(BG) Mr President, in early August, an incredible drama unfolded in the Republic of Macedonia which shocked Bulgarian public opinion.
Spaska Mitrova, a 23-year-old Macedonian citizen and mother of a small child still being breast-fed, was forcibly taken to a police station and then transferred to the infamous Idrizovo prison, while her child was taken away from her.
The police had to drag her by the hair from the top to the bottom floor of the building because she did not want to be separated from her child.
She was sentenced to three months' imprisonment because she was unable to provide her ex-husband with a bed in their child's bedroom.
You can imagine the implications of this.
Mrs Mitrova was also given Bulgarian citizenship early this year.
This seems to be the main reason for her inhumane treatment, and hers is not an isolated case.
About two years ago, I asked the present Macedonian Foreign Minister: 'Why is so much hatred shown towards Macedonians who have taken Bulgarian citizenship?', to which he replied: 'They are vestiges of the past'.
As the efforts made by the Bulgarian President and Government have not yielded any result, I appeal to Commissioner Olli Rehn to familiarise himself personally with this blatant case of injustice in a country wishing to start accession negotiations.
(SL) Italy wishes to impose an onshore gas terminal on the border with Slovenia without consultation.
However, the European Union was founded on mutual trust and good neighbourly relations.
The supply of environmentally-harmful energy sources requires special conservation of the environment but, in essence, it also requires basic honesty.
By seeking to conceal from Slovenia the harmful consequences which its actions will have on the cross-border environment, Italy is harming everyone concerned, including itself but, above all, the people who live in the vicinity of the disputed installation.
The Slovenian public and the Slovenian Government are firmly opposed to this terminal.
Lying to the cameras may well be Mr Berlusconi's means of political survival in Italy.
However, such behaviour cannot and should not be tolerated as a deliberate practice within the European Union.
This is unacceptable.
This is a flagrant breach of the principles of the European Union and Italy is being manipulative to the detriment of human life and the environment.
It is using international deception to attempt to build an onshore terminal at Žavlje (Aquilinia) in the Gulf of Trieste, which is already extremely narrow.
It is degrading the environment, destroying the prospect of communal coexistence on the border and setting a very poor example to future Member States.
(PT) Mr President, what is happening to the former German footwear factory, Rhode, in Santa Maria da Feira, now called Sociedade Luso-Alemã de Calçado, is very worrying.
This company once employed some 3 000 workers but, after the problems in Germany, it shed jobs and currently has roughly 1 000 workers.
The majority of them are women, most of whom have had their hours and wages cut.
It is now feared that when the elections in Portugal are over, the company may close.
Unemployment in this municipality is continuing to rise and now affects many thousands of workers, particularly in the footwear and cork processing industries.
In view of that, we appeal for special emergency intervention measures so as to prevent yet another serious blow to production and jobs in an area that has been so badly blighted by unemployment.
Mr President, I do not accept the validity of this Parliament or any other EU institution to make laws for the United Kingdom.
My electors have sent me here to tell you that they do not want GBP 45 million of their money every single day spent in the European Union.
We want that money spent in the UK on our schools, on our hospitals and our infrastructure, not wasted on corruption with your accounts in auditing for 14 years.
Simply, I have this message from the people who elected me to the Commission: go back to your bureaucracy and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union.
Mr President, this Parliament has united in recent times in the face of a global terrorist threat.
In my constituency of Northern Ireland, we know the pain of terrorism.
Yes, we have witnessed a transformation in Northern Ireland in recent years, but there are still those who would seek to cause bloodshed.
Last week, in the latest of a series of incidents, a 600 lb bomb was planted by dissident republicans and was discovered in South Armagh.
Had it not been discovered, multiple loss of life would have occurred.
In Northern Ireland, we have not forgotten the victims of our past and of terrorism and that is why I would ask this Parliament to back the campaign for compensation from Libya.
Libya supplied weapons to the IRA.
Those weapons took many lives and left others destroyed.
For this they must be held accountable.
(SK) At the start of a new term in office, we should bear in mind our joint responsibility for the peaceful development of the continent of Europe in such a way as to ensure a peaceful and prosperous life for our citizens.
We must also show our citizens that we are here for them, that we are here to serve them.
We must constantly bear this in mind, even when there are problems between two members of our family.
The European way of sorting things out is through proper partnership dialogue aimed at a sensible solution, not through ignoring the other side and presenting issues directly to European institutions such as this one.
Rational mutual dialogue on a constant basis is also the way to deny sustenance to extremists on both sides of the border and thereby nip in the bud or severely restrict potentially dangerous activities they might undertake in the future.
(RO) The fight against racism is being waged through strong European policies, but in less than a week, German and British politicians have been engaged in mudslinging at Romanian workers, whether out of ignorance or because they are motivated by winning sympathy and votes from the population.
Grim statements such as 'Romanians would stick a knife in you as quick as look at you', made during a public meeting in the UK, or comments made by a German politician stating that Romanians do not come to work for 07.00 and they do not know what they have to do, are a major sign of concern.
We are devising European policies to combat racism.
This is our common objective.
However, what do we do when these statements are made by fellow politicians from large European Union Member States?
(ES) Mr President, last week, three Basque tuna boats from Bermeo were threatened once again by Somalian pirates.
We are concerned about the repeated attacks on fishing boats in the area, the fact that the victims feel unsafe and that the Spanish Government is failing to act.
These attacks could get worse with the arrival of the monsoons, as the fishermen are saying.
Therefore, before it is too late, I want to say to the House that we urgently need armed military escorts on these boats.
There are European governments such as France and Italy that have done this, and it has succeeded.
The Commission should therefore recommend that all Member States take immediate, effective measures such as this.
We urgently need to extend the protection criteria that have been established for merchant navy routes to fishing areas.
This House has a problem, which it stated in the Resolution on piracy on 23 October last year.
Finally, I would like to reiterate our conviction that Europe needs a common foreign and security policy that makes the European institutions more effective and credible in response to this type of crisis.
(EL) Mr President, the deadly attacks by the German troops which form part of the occupying army in Afghanistan, together with the United States of America, the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, during the attack in the region of Kunduz on 4 September 2009, turned into a massacre, with victims numbering over 135 civilians dead and dozens injured, including many children, and are war crimes against the Afghan people.
This attack was not, of course, against the Taliban; it was against 500 civilians.
The daily bloodbath, the organisation of violent and corrupt elections to put puppets of the Afghan occupation in place and the poverty and misery which are the scourge of the Afghan people reveal that the imperialist attacks by the United States of America, the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ in this occupied country - and in a series of other countries - on the pretext of combating terrorism have disastrous consequences for the people.
Both the statements made by the new NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and those made by European Union foreign ministers have just one objective: to continue the interventions against the people.
The people in each country and in each Member State of the European Union must demand and insist that the troops leave their countries and return to their own country.
Mr President, on 2 October, the Irish will have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
The Lisbon Treaty is almost identical to the European Constitution, which was rejected outright by the French and the Dutch.
The Lisbon Treaty has already been rejected by the Irish once, but 'no' is always the wrong answer, as far as the European Union is concerned, when it comes to further political integration.
And so the Irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the European Union - which is 'yes'.
The European Union is destroying democracy in its Member States.
The EU is founded on misrepresentation, deceit and lies.
The British are denied a referendum by our contemptible government and political class precisely because they know that the result would be a resounding 'no'.
But whatever the result in Ireland, Britain will one day leave the European Union and restore its national independence.
I am proud to use my position of office to campaign for Britain's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Thank you, Mr Batten.
I gave you an extra 14 seconds even though you said something incorrect, namely that the Treaty of Lisbon is the same thing as the Constitution.
(RO) Mr President, I would like to talk to you today about a European project, 'Voices of Youth', of which I have the honour of being asked to be a patron.
The goal of this project, which young people from every Member State participate in, is for them to identify and offer solutions to social problems they face.
I ask not only you, Mr President, but also the President of the European Commission, to ensure that we pay more attention to the suggestions they make to us.
It is our responsibility during these difficult times to guarantee Europe and, above all, young European citizens, a clear opportunity.
My generation has been fortunate enough to be involved in the reconstruction of a united Europe.
Young people have the right, representing the Europe of today, but particularly the Europe of tomorrow, to turn it into how they imagine it will be.
Thank you and may God's help be with us.
Thank you, and thank you also for being concise.
(HU) The spectre of extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing ideology, reflecting the two dictatorships that dominated Europe in the 20th century, is returning to haunt the European Union in the 21st century.
We have an EU citizen being banned from travelling to another country.
This person's freedom of movement is being restricted.
A state would lock up 15 citizens, accuse them of treason and ban them from leaving the country because they are going to discuss minority-related concerns with like-minded compatriots at the Forum of Hungarian MPs from the Carpathian Basin.
In the country in question, people are punished for not speaking the official language properly in hospitals, at police stations, in homes for the elderly and maternity units.
Not even immigrants are treated like this within the European Union, let alone people who have lived on this territory for a thousand years, where a new state has been formed for only 17 years.
This is why it is important to implement within the European Union a single law for the protection of minorities which is binding on every country.
Mr President, I wish to inform Parliament that last week, the UK Justice Minister gave Michael Shields, my constituent, a pardon, and he was freed from prison having served four and a half years for a crime he did not commit.
Michael was given a pardon on the basis of evidence clearly showing that he was morally and technically innocent of the crime.
He was arrested, charged and convicted of a brutal attack on Martin Georgiev, a Bulgarian waiter, in 2005 in less than eight weeks, despite the lack of forensic evidence, a flawed identification process and a signed confession to the attack by another man, Graham Sankey.
Today I want to thank Presidents Borrell and Pöttering and Parliament's Committee on Petitions for supporting Michael's campaign for justice.
But this is not the end of the process, and I ask the President and the Committee on Petitions to continue to support Michael's campaign for justice and to intervene with the Bulgarian authorities immediately to review the dossier of evidence.
This is vital if we are to give every one of our citizens trust and confidence in judicial and police cooperation in Europe.
(ET) Banking requires supervision.
That is the position of the European Council and the European Commission.
The European Commission consumer protection study published in February revealed several negative trends in banking.
As an elected representative from Estonia, I would like to present some examples from Estonia concerning two Swedish banks that are operating in Estonia.
The problem is that these banks treat consumers in Estonia differently from consumers in their home country.
Both the prices of banking services and interest rates are considerably higher for Estonian consumers.
Interest rates, for instance, vary from 0.21% in Sweden to 12.2% in Estonia - that is a 600-fold difference.
Using the financial crisis as a justification for unequal treatment is not in keeping with European Union values.
And I would like to ask Sweden, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, what it has to say about this, and how long this situation with their banks will continue in Estonia.
(DE) Mr President, we need a democratic revolution, I said, and now we face a situation that represents an untenable state of affairs for all those of us who, of our own free will, are not represented in a political group in this Parliament.
I would like to ask the Bureau to find an amicable solution to the issue of coordinators.
In this respect, we are discriminated against, as we are not permitted to take part in coordinators' meetings in various committees and be duly active.
I would be glad to help avoid a situation where proceedings before the European Court of Justice - as previously in the wake of the discrimination case from 2001 - resulted in a finding that all the coordination decisions made thus far are unlawful.
That would not only harm Parliament tremendously, but it is also unnecessary from a political point of view.
I therefore ask the Bureau, in urgent terms, to put in place appropriate measures to end this discrimination against non-attached Members and return to the sound working methods of the last ten years.
(ES) Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard.
I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families.
ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders.
The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent
I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.
Mr President, six months ago the world was shocked by the death and destruction visited by Israel upon Gaza.
Now the cameras have gone away, yet the economic siege continues.
Less than one quarter of the materials and supplies needed by the people there are getting through the checkpoints - just 18 items in all.
Nothing for reconstruction, nothing for business, nothing that creates jobs or offers hope.
Israel is, in effect, keeping one and a half million people in a form of prison camp, surrounded by walls, patrolled by armed guards.
Mr President, I ask you to convey to the President that he should visit Gaza at the earliest opportunity to judge the situation for himself.
If he believes that such collective punishment cannot be acceptable, he should speak out on behalf of the innocent.
(DE) Mr President, the economic crisis has hit agricultural production hard.
The situation in dairy farming, in particular, has deteriorated drastically over the last 20 months.
With prices below EUR 0.21, farmers have to sell their milk at a price that is less than their production costs.
The survival of many family-run farms in the EU is in grave danger, and at present many of them are only able to survive by relying on their personal savings, something that is clearly not sustainable.
The Commission's figures provide a dramatic picture of the fall in prices for milk and milk products.
The support measures for dairy farming are vital in order to prevent a collapse in agriculture.
Quality has a price, but this principle no longer seems to apply in the agricultural sector.
At present, the producer price bears no relation to the consumer price.
Our family-run farms urgently need market support measures.
This is about ensuring the security of Europe's food supply.
Above all, we must not forget that hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe depend on agriculture functioning.
Mr President, I want to raise the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos, who is in prison in Greece.
His family, who are my constituents, are convinced of his innocence.
At the beginning of this year, I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case.
I did not get a reply, so in a one-minute speech here in May in this Hemicycle I raised the question.
Immediately after I had spoken, the Greek Permanent Representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the Minister in person.
Four months later: nothing.
If the Greek Permanent Representation is listening to us now in the Hemicycle, I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened.
Would they please get me a reply from the Minister and look at the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos again?
Mr President, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, a Turkish journalist photographed 14 Cypriot soldiers surrendering to the Turkish army.
This photograph became the symbol of the search for the fate of the missing persons.
The soldiers' bodies were identified through DNA a few weeks ago after they were killed 35 years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island.
This demonstrates the blatant violation of the Geneva Convention by the Turkish Army, who were responsible for prisoners who surrendered to them.
I urge this Parliament to call on Turkey to cooperate with the UN Committee on Missing Persons by providing its records and by opening two recently designated plots in Lapithos, called 'restricted military areas', where another 800 prisoners are believed to be buried.
Mr President, this Parliament will have many important discussions, and decisions to make, on budget matters.
Currently we are, of course, looking at the 2010 budget, and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that.
This Parliament will also soon start discussing the new financial perspective for the period post 2013.
But there is also the mid-term budget review, and it seems to me we have almost forgotten about that.
We should not forget about it, because this will give us great opportunities in the future.
It will give us the opportunity to look again at what our priorities are.
It will give us the opportunity, for example, to put more funds into a new economic regeneration plan for Europe.
It will also, perhaps, give us the opportunity to put extra funding into the measures which come out of Copenhagen at the end of this year.
I believe that this Parliament should not take its eye off the ball.
This Parliament should continue to press the Council and the Commission to make sure it looks again at that mid-term review and to give us the opportunity to put forward our priorities.
(HU) Freedom of speech, Mr President, including the freedom to choose the language you wish to speak, is a fundamental human right.
A language is a symbol of paramount importance to the people who speak it, the basis for their self-identity.
Anyone who thinks this of their own language must respect the language of every other community.
However, one of the EU's official languages, Hungarian, has recently come under attack in Slovakia, in a way which goes completely against the European mindset.
Its language law blatantly discriminates against the right of the half a million-strong Hungarian community to use its own language.
In some cases, a fine of EUR 5 000 may also be imposed.
The European Union is committed to cultural and linguistic diversity, and a commissioner for multilingualism was even appointed with this in mind.
The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which has also been ratified by Slovakia, guarantees the right of citizens to use their mother tongue at every education level, for administrative matters, in public institutions and official documents.
The only mainstay of the EU institutions cannot allow one of the Member States to blatantly contravene fundamental EU norms and launch an attack against minority rights without speaking out.
(PL) The House debated the situation of the Polish shipbuilding industry a few months ago.
Agreement was reached.
Mr Schulz, the chairman of our political group, confirmed on behalf of the group that Parliament did not consent to doing away with tens of thousands of jobs in shipyards and at the undertakings supplying them.
Mr Schulz confirmed that the House did not agree with closing down this industry in Poland, or with the consequent reduction in Europe's industrial capacity.
Six months have elapsed and the situation is as follows. The government has been unable to privatise the shipyards, the Commission has taken no account whatsoever of Parliament's position, the yards are not producing, the future is uncertain, people have lost their jobs and have been left in limbo.
We must surely all agree that this Commission lacks any concept of a European industrial policy, and has failed to understand that ships were needed in the past, that they are needed now and that they will continue to be needed in the years to come.
Mr President, 23 August 2009 marked the 70th anniversary of the infamous Nazi-Soviet Pact which divided Europe.
I think that this is a shocking example of how close seemingly opposite political extremes can become.
Both Moscow and Berlin then agreed that the first task was to bring down the democratic political order in Europe; both Moscow and Berlin sought to achieve the domination of the world.
Therefore, we should never forget that it took two dictators to launch World War Two.
Stalin, four days before signing this pact, explained the point of it to his comrades: 'It is in the interests of the Soviet Union that war breaks out between the Reich and the capitalist Anglo-French bloc.
Everything must be done so that the war lasts as long as possible in order that both sides become exhausted.
Then we would have a large arena to develop the world revolution.'
I would like to remind Members of the European Parliament resolution of last April to mark 23 August as a joint day of commemoration for victims of all totalitarian regimes.
(SK) Both in the last session of parliament and in the current one, we have heard speeches by many Hungarian MEPs criticising the Slovak language law.
I would like to mention at the same time that you have all been sent documents containing various arguments, the majority of which, to put it plainly, amount to misinterpretations, fabrications and even deliberate lies.
The Slovak language law fully complies with all the human rights issues and with the rights protecting minority languages.
In my opinion, the Hungarian MEPs are pursuing a very dangerous policy of pointedly and directly provoking extremism, both in Hungary and in its neighbouring states.
In my opinion, they ought to realise that this is a highly dangerous policy and, as we have heard today, they should call a halt to these fabrications.
(SL) I have received requests from a large number of Slovenian and Italian citizens asking me to draw this House's attention to Italy's intention to build a gas terminal in the Gulf of Trieste.
I share the concern of Slovenian and Italian environmental organisations that this gas terminal could place a major burden on what is already a very environmentally vulnerable area.
I refer here to the seas of the Gulf of Trieste and its large urban hinterland.
These organisations have also expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the documents used in the environmental impact assessment.
I also call on the governments of Italy and Slovenia to work together on this project in the spirit of the memorandum they signed in September last year.
In other words, I call on them to work together on environmental impact assessments in the northern Adriatic, and the Gulf of Trieste respectively.
I also expect that, as a result of carrying out such an assessment, the governments will be able to agree on a more appropriate site for this gas terminal than the Gulf of Trieste.
(FI) Mr President, I agree with my Estonian colleague, Mrs Oviir, that the economic crisis is far from over.
A peculiar kind of optimism is emerging everywhere in Europe, even though unemployment is on the increase, national economies are running into debt, the population is ageing, and a sort of triple guillotine is hanging over Europe, and despite all that, the recession has been declared over.
An exit strategy is being planned, as is how we need not bother to continue with the recovery strategy.
Europe began the recovery strategy and dealing with the economic crisis very well and in an exemplary fashion, to the extent that the United States of America learned a lesson from Europe and followed its example, but after that, Europe slowed down completely.
Furthermore, this false optimism is also leading to the wrong solutions.
The economic crisis has not been beaten.
(RO) The formation of the Alliance for European Integration, in the wake of the early elections held in July 2009, reconfirms the pro-European commitment of the Republic of Moldova's citizens.
An extremely important step has been taken, which Moldova and the European Union cannot afford to mishandle.
The political situation is still fragile.
This is why the success of the alliance and, by implication, of a democratic Moldova, depends hugely on the support of its European partners.
Moldova has assumed the responsibility of committing to a pro-European course.
The European Union's responsibility is to facilitate its course on this path.
The Moldovan people's choice of the European option is now also shown at a political level.
This is why we must give our unconditional support to the Alliance for European Integration in the Republic of Moldova, as it represents the only chance for integrating it gradually, yet quickly, into the European family.
I call on the European Commission to negotiate the signing of a new agreement with the Republic of Moldova as a matter of urgency and to use all the necessary resources to help this republic emerge from the difficult financial situation it is in.
(HU) The European Union's credibility is completely undermined if it only speaks out in the case of human rights violations happening outside the EU, but makes no protest in the case of a serious human rights violation like the one which has just taken place in Slovakia as a consequence of the national language law and has also triggered unparalleled tension in relations between the majority and minority communities.
The minority language has been subordinated to the majority language, as Mr Vollebaek, the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, also put it.
I would like to point out to my colleague, Boris Zala, that we would be very happy not to have to raise the issue here in the European Parliament.
I have done so only as a consequence of the fact that a law has come into force in Slovakia which severely restricts the use of minority languages and discriminates against the Hungarian community living there.
This is why it will be the responsibility of the next Commission and Mr Barroso to set up forums where these cases can be examined, as Leonard Orban has also stated in his letter.
Slovakia must honour its international commitments, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
(PL) Mr President, I asked for the floor in order to refer to the mission to Afghanistan.
This subject is fraught with difficulties for all concerned.
NATO and the European Union are both affected.
In particular, I wanted to highlight the need to place greater emphasis on the requirement for humanitarian, social and economic aid for the Afghan people, who have unfortunately been subjected to the effects of war for 30 years.
I raise this matter against the background of an escalation of actions involving attacks on soldiers in the context of the presidential election.
As we are all aware, these attacks have become increasingly frequent and violent in the run up to the election.
Such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country.
Captain Daniel Ambroziński of the Polish Armed Forces lost his life recently in Afghanistan.
It appears that his death was due essentially to the weakness of the Afghan Army and police, who succumbed to bribery.
It is well known that the Afghan Army and police force are in a difficult financial situation.
According to the media, Afghan soldiers are lucky if they earn USD 20.
It is important for the military effort to be accompanied by social, humanitarian and economic aid.
Twenty seconds for Mr Kelly, for a very brief rejoinder.
Mr President, I just want to say very briefly that an erroneous and somewhat condescending statement was made this evening about the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland by a British colleague.
Ireland has not been forced by anybody to vote a second time on Lisbon.
It was a decision taken independently by the Irish Parliament and will be carried out independently by the Irish people.
In fact, we have not been forced to do anything since we gained our independence from Britain in 1922.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have had 39 speeches in 45 minutes.
I believe that is a fine performance - this has been a good debate - and I offer my best wishes above all to all those who have made their first speech.
I would like to stress, in particular, the need for the Commission to take account of the comments that were made in the debate, or else our Parliament will just be a place to let off steam.
The Commission has been attentive.
I noted that our Commissioners were very attentive, and so they will doubtless follow up the comments made by all of our fellow Members.

Statistics on pesticides (
Just by way of explanation, this is the third in a triad of reports on the use of pesticides.
Earlier this year, in the last Parliament, we adopted a Regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.
At that time, we also adopted a Directive on sustainable use of pesticides, and the present Regulation concerning statistics on pesticides is the third component.
This proposal had to be dealt with by the Conciliation Committee, as something went wrong in the last Parliament.
A great many people were not there and, at second reading, too few people were present for us to obtain sufficient votes to conclude that second reading.
In this connection, I wanted to take the floor to thank the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, the Czech Presidency, as they could have totally ruined the second reading: they could have refused to go to conciliation.
Thanks to their good relations with Parliament, and also thanks to the chairmen of the political groups, who joined me in writing a letter to the Presidency immediately after the elections, it has proved possible to save this report and, via the conciliation procedure, to ensure that we can today vote on the text in the form agreed at second reading.
I should like to thank everyone involved.

European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress) (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Göncz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress Microfinance Facility) - C7-0053/2009 -.
(FR) Madam President, I note that, throughout the previous debate, you referred to the debate that is now to take place as a debate on Progress.
However, the decision of this Parliament, confirmed by the Conference of Presidents, is that we will only vote on the 'microfinance' facility.
I therefore think that this clarification is an important one.
This is a debate on microfinance and not on the Progress programme.
Thank you very much, Madam President, and I am also very grateful for this clarification, as it is vitally important that we are now going to talk about the microfinance facility.
I would also like to welcome Commissioner Špidla to the following debate.
Let me begin by saying that when I became rapporteur for this programme, I thought that I would have a very easy job, given the wide-ranging consensus and support on this issue, something which was also in evidence during the debate.
This support was wide-ranging in many respects.
On the one hand, as a crisis management facility, it will also help precisely those who are in the most desperate situation, who have lost their job and who cannot access credit or assistance either due to the financial crisis.
On the other hand, this is typically a facility which does not provide people with fish, but teaches them how to fish.
It triggers precisely the type of creativity which we need most from the point of view of ensuring a positive outcome to the crisis.
The third aspect which received, and still receives, wide-ranging support is the fact that the European Union's resources are growing, which I think is the finance ministers' dream.
Some of the resources are being contributed by the European Investment Bank, while others are coming from other commercial banks as the European Union will be primarily covering the risk, thereby making it easier for the other participants to assume the risk.
As I have mentioned, there is wide support for the programme's content.
I think that, thanks to these aspects, the issue which provoked debate during the discussions with the Council and Commission was to do with which resources the European Union will use to finance this particular primary risk that has been assumed.
The second point of contention was the extent of the resources which could help launch the facility and can be expected to actually attract other significant resources.
The Council and Commission originally proposed that EUR 100 million should come from the Progress programme, which is primarily used to draw up policies for combating social exclusion and supporting equal opportunities.
We, for our part, said right from the start that the Progress programme cannot be jeopardised in any way since, during the current crisis, it is needed even more than before.
It is also not acceptable for us to tinker with the Progress programme to such an extent that could really jeopardise it.
Parliament was extremely willing to compromise during the debate.
We also held three informal trialogues, one of which went on until the early hours, where we proposed that we could tinker with the Progress programme in any way that would not jeopardise its function.
We suggested that, considering the original proposal, we could envisage launching the programme even with EUR 100 million rather than EUR 150 million.
Parliament's 2010 draft budget found resources of EUR 25 million, which will enable it to launch the programme at the very start of 2010, and it was able to find these resources without touching the Progress programme in 2010.
We also requested this item be removed from today's agenda because we failed to reach agreement on it.
Another matter we felt was an issue was that the Presidency arrived during the trialogue on all three occasions without any mandate, making it very difficult for it to consider our proposals properly.
I believe it is important for Parliament to vote as soon as possible on this matter, this very week even, so that this project can therefore be launched at the start of 2010 with a fund of EUR 100 million, because this conveys the message that this is a crisis management facility where speed is a particularly important consideration.
I sincerely hope that Commissioner Špidla can help us get the Commission to withdraw its original proposal on diverting the EUR 100 million from the Progress programme so that this programme can be launched as soon as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech my emphasising the importance of this initiative in the area of micro-financing.
The current crisis is bringing about a significant rise in unemployment in all of the Member States, the effects of which will unfortunately fall hardest on the most vulnerable members of our society.
The micro-financing instrument is specifically aimed at assisting these groups of citizens to find alternative employment and to become micro-entrepreneurs themselves.
I would like to congratulate the Committee on Employment for the outstanding work they have carried out in this area and, in particular, to applaud the contribution made by Mrs Göncz to this initiative.
I am aware of the efforts that were made in the negotiations between Parliament and the Council aimed at achieving agreement at the first reading.
In view of the fact that both bodies support the micro-financing instrument, it was possible to make considerable progress over the essential wording of the proposal.
This progress is reflected to a considerable extent in the amendments proposed today.
Of course, the most difficult question is the budget.
Although both bodies will probably approve an overall budget of EUR 100 million for this instrument, identifying the sources of the finance continues to be the main obstacle.
As you know, the micro-financing proposal forms part of a package which includes a proposal to transfer EUR 100 million from the Progress programme.
You have decided not to vote on this second proposal this week.
The transfer of funds from the Progress programme is support by the Council and, for many of the Member States, it constitutes a fundamental element of the whole package.
Without an agreement over the source of finance in this area, we will not achieve our objective of implementing the new instrument rapidly.
Today, however, we are debating the wording of the decision through which the instrument is to be set up.
In conclusion, I would like once more to applaud the rapporteur for the work she has carried out in submitting a report and amendments that will enable both of the lawmaking bodies to concentrate on the main problem that remains to be resolved, namely the funding.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). - (SV) Madam President, if we are to reduce unemployment, then both the EU and the Member States must shoulder greater responsibility.
The proposal for microfinancing is an initiative that Parliament has been pushing for.
It is about giving the unemployed a new start and opening the door to enterprise for some of the most vulnerable groups in the EU, including young people.
The proposal is intended to facilitate small-scale investments and provide microenterprises with the opportunity to grow.
Following some minor amendments and clarifications the proposal received broad support from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The issue on which there has been debate is its financing, as has also been mentioned here.
The Commission proposed that no extra funds would be made available, with funding instead being taken from the Progress programme.
It has been incorrectly asserted that this opinion is shared by the lead committee, but that is not so.
That is the current situation.
I must say that I find it strange that the Council is so stubbornly rejecting our proposal for EUR 150 million during the period - a mean and miserly approach in these difficult times!
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we could sense during the previous debates as well that the economic crisis and how to emerge from it are a preoccupation for every one of us and are being given ample attention.
As the coordinator from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would simply like to confirm that we support in every single dossier tabled before us one of the most important items for us, namely, the protection of jobs and the creation of new jobs.
Let me remind you that the PPE Group has been supporting the issue of micro-credit for a long time.
In fact, it was my former colleague, Zsolt Becsey, who first tabled this topic before the House in his own-initiative report in 2009.
This was based on earlier and current experiences in Hungary with this facility, which was called the Széchenyi card, and had the same purpose as in the current case: providing micro-enterprises with small, short-term credits.
Let us think of butchers, bakers, greengrocers or perhaps even chemists.
They are also being affected by the crisis.
They employ a huge number of people.
In some countries, this sector even accounts for more than 90% of employees.
This is the case, for example, in Hungary for more than 90% of firms and enterprises.
They do not need a large amount of money and they do not want to pay a great deal of interest either.
In certain cases, they need temporary working credit and temporary assistance.
The Commission's proposal addresses this very problem and, as the rapporteur said, this proposal really has wide-ranging support and consensus.
Therefore, I think that it is important for us to agree on the issue of funding as soon as possible as well.
We also support the 35 proposals jointly submitted by the PPE Group, along with the Socialists, Liberals and Conservatives, because we feel that this provides the guarantee that we can approve this facility at first reading and launch it as soon as possible.
Madam President, I am rather surprised.
We are going to adopt an instrument that creates an innovative tool, a vital tool, to allow those most vulnerable to this crisis to face it and to come up with their own jobs in the future.
This is an instrument to be adopted using the codecision procedure, but the Council is not here.
This must be because the Council has nothing to say to us on this issue and does not consider itself bound by the European Parliament's position.
In any case, that is the impression that we have had at times throughout the negotiations.
The European Parliament is going to assume its responsibilities.
Thanks to the cooperation and constructive understanding between all the groups, it is going to adopt the microfinance instrument, which is consistent with its actions over many years, as Mr Őry reminded us.
However, I would also like to point to the pilot projects that we initiated.
We know that in this crisis situation, the most vulnerable people - those who do not have access to the large banks to release loans to fund their initiatives - are able, through this tool, to launch their own strategies and, in a way, to create their own jobs.
I will not go back over the content, development and scope of the negotiations that have taken place.
The negotiations were held in appropriate conditions.
The issue of funding is more serious.
When you look at the initiative launched by Mr Barroso in autumn 2008 to organise the European recovery, this tool was defined as an important one to be used in achieving the European Union's strategy.
However, the Commission has proposed to us that we should simply finance a new project by robbing a useful project that was already on the table.
We had a project to benefit support networks for the most vulnerable - the Progress project - to which the European Parliament was highly committed, and, in order to fund microfinance, the Commission is proposing to us that we should simply tap into the funds allocated to the Progress programme.
It is this sleight of hand that this Parliament does not accept, and that is why we have not concluded the negotiations.
That is why, taking a responsible attitude, we say that we are prepared to examine our proposal with the Spanish Presidency at the very beginning of January: EUR 40 million taken from the budgetary margins, EUR 60 million taken from the Progress programme, with EUR 20 million redeployed, enabling the burden to be distributed fairly.
We will then assume our responsibilities as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to look at how such a programme is implemented in each of the Member States, to bring about a synergy between the various experiments to be conducted in the Member States - we are sure of this - when the package as a whole is adopted in January.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the proposed microfinance facility.
Earlier, we spoke about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and how it can assist redundant workers in certain sectors.
The microfinance facility is another piece in the jigsaw where the EU, in this case, is trying to ensure access to micro-credit for those who would not be able to access that credit from what we might define as the normal or usual financial institutions.
This would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship.
In this context, I am pleased to see that credit unions, cooperative banks and other mutual financial institutions can operate the fund, because they are often closer to those who may wish to access this particular facility.
Indeed, I do not know about elsewhere, but in Ireland, the only financial institution left standing that did not require taxpayers' money to sustain it was the credit union movement, which is a not-for-profit institution run by its members.
When we speak of social inclusion as part of EU social policy, we need to ensure that, by our actions, social inclusion is integral to the decisions we take, and this programme has social inclusion written all over it.
In this context, I want to express my extreme disappointment that after three trialogues, we were unable to reach agreement on the source of funding for this facility.
In my opinion, the Swedish Presidency did not seem to have the facility to have any meaningful negotiations on the matter.
I do not know about you but, as I said, I was very disappointed that a figure of at most EUR 40 million over three years for 27 Member States was all that divided us.
Obviously, many finance ministers did not support real negotiation.
I could not help but think that many of those same ministers allocated billions to support banks, but were unable to support other financial institutions that would provide micro-credit to those who have lost their jobs and who would have difficulty in accessing credit from the same banks that have been saved.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, micro-credits and small loans can help people who are not able to get credit through normal market mechanisms.
As has already been said, they can also help these people to set up businesses and create jobs with their ideas.
Such credits can help people to get out of a crisis if they are capable of doing so.
Micro-credits are also an important instrument for supporting the social economy.
With its diverse aspects and traditions, it has also been a recognised local employment policy instrument within the EU since 2000.
On account of this, in 2006, this Parliament, in its wisdom, established that resources from the European Social Fund could also be paid out as micro-credits or subsidised loans, as laid down in Article 11 of the European Social Fund Regulation.
However, EUR 76 billion is available for the European Social Fund, and with cofinancing that becomes EUR 118 billion!
Even a tenth of that would still be EUR 11 billion that the Member States could use.
However, they do not use it for micro-credits.
For that reason, the Commission created a test phase for micro-credits with an instrument called JASMINE - also financed from European structural funds, and because this was so successful, a new instrument is intended to follow in its wake.
However, this will no longer come from the structural funds, where we have billions available to us, but from the smallest of all of the European Union's programmes, the poverty programme Progress, for which a total of only EUR 743 million is available over seven years.
It is intended for NGOs which are establishing networks in the Member States in order to provide a pressure group for the poorest of the poor.
The European Roma Information Office alone gets 50% of its funding from Progress.
It establishes national and regional information and advisory offices and gives the Roma minority a voice, particularly in the Eastern European States.
If this House follows the Council and names this instrument Progress, as proposed in the compromises put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, then the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not give its approval to this instrument.
We cannot allow such conjuring tricks - on one side, taking away money from the poor and, on the other, paying out ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Ladies and gentlemen, in a time of continuing financial and economic crisis it is necessary to support not only banks and big companies but also small firms and self-employed people.
We all know that it is these small firms, including family-owned firms, which create and sustain large numbers of jobs.
We support the creation of the new financial instrument of the micro-finance programme for employment and social inclusion which, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, will improve the availability of loans precisely for self-employed people and small start-ups and family firms.
We agree to the release of resources amounting to EUR 100 million for securing these small loans for a fixed period.
We regard this programme as a good and effective instrument for an active policy on employment and as a good way of spending so-called European money, in other words, our money.
We fully endorse the proposal to release the necessary resources for this financial instrument from the resources originally intended for the Progress programme.
We do not agree to funding for the micro-financing instrument being obtained from reserves or from other budget chapters.
The resources of the Progress programme, which amount to EUR 700 million if I am correctly informed, are used for building up study and analysis networks.
None of the resources of the Progress programme have been earmarked for directly supporting people who are seeking work or creating jobs.
I do not doubt that it is necessary to build up networks and produce analyses and studies.
In the current period, however, which is not easy for entrepreneurs and employees, I give precedence to using these resources from the EU budget for programmes directly targeted at employers and employees.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports.
However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it.
Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation.
What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme - at best, it is a nanofinance programme!
Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out.
Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable.
Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme.
Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect.
Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way.
In this form, we will reject this programme.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision passed by the European Parliament and the Council establishing a European micro-financing instrument in the area of employment and social inclusion is, in essence, a draft which adapts the original Progress programme to the current economic reality of a Europe marked by the financial and economic crisis.
The Commission is proposing support in the form of micro-credits for small enterprises, creating a stimulus for maintaining and developing employment in crisis-hit regions.
If we wish to achieve this objective, however, we must ensure that the financial resources provided are not spent on social benefits or consumption.
They must go only to sensible, sustainable business activities through the use of objectively measurable criteria and transparent procedures.
It is therefore very important to require of the ultimate providers of the loans that they thoroughly assess the business plans of the applicants, the risks of the business projects submitted and also the return on the resources invested.
I therefore consider it highly necessary to support and complete the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which provide a sensible framework for the Commission's proposal.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems strange that there should be opposition to this excellent and important programme in this House, given the worsening employment situation.
The prediction is that there will be another 10 million unemployed people in Europe next year and that those with poorer labour status will face tougher times ahead.
This data underlines the importance of investing in entrepreneurship.
It is always companies just starting up that have the biggest problems getting bank loans.
For example, over 93% of companies in Finland are micro-enterprises with fewer than 10 staff, and yet these small companies employ 46% of the working population.
It is only right, therefore, that the EU should establish a microfinance facility in response to this employment crisis and, in that way, also lend support to those programmes in the individual Member States which pursue the same objective.
I wish like to stress, however, that this programme will require a comprehensive approach.
The social benefit, holiday and pension systems in small companies also need to be developed in line with other sectors.
Europe is especially lacking in high-risk funding and those individuals, the business angels, who are prepared to invest in a company in its early stages.
Entrepreneurship education and connections to work and employment should also be supported at all levels of education, and there should be more young people's workshops and business incubators and more funds available for them.
Microfinance can only work as a component of this sort of comprehensive approach, in which the situation of new small entrepreneurs and the whole environment in which they operate is one that provides real opportunities to continue in business successfully and profitably.
Madam President, I very much welcome this initiative.
Unemployment is the biggest social problem we face right now, and anything we can do to mitigate its impact is important for the well-being of our societies.
However, a proposal for EUR 100 million over a three-year period lacks ambition, in my view, given the growth in unemployment.
I am likewise surprised that the money proposed is not new money, and that we will in effect be robbing Peter to pay Paul, as has already been said, at a time when all the money we can find should be used in the Progress programme, on existing schemes.
We must do all we can to reach agreement quickly with the Spanish Presidency so that the programme can get under way at the earliest possible date.
It is equally incumbent on the Council to get its act together and to meet Parliament with regard to our concerns.
This is no time for the Council to haggle over what is a tiny amount of money.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr De Rossa, has it occurred to you that unemployment in Ireland has a tremendous amount to do with Ireland's continuing membership of the euro, which means that Ireland cannot devalue, cannot reduce interest rates and cannot do any quantitative easing?
Has it ever occurred to you that it might be better if Ireland left the euro, rather than stretching out its begging hand to the contributing countries of the European Union?
Madam President, I have no problem at all in seeking to answer that usual nonsense from the far right of this Parliament.
Without the euro, the Irish economy would be in hell at the moment.
As I was saying, this is no time for the Council to haggle over what is a tiny amount of money given the scale of the jobs crisis, the size of the overall budget and certainly in the context of the support that Member States, and indeed the European Central Bank, have given to the banking sector - a banking sector, incidentally, which will not lend to the people that we are seeking to facilitate.
I have every confidence that if there is goodwill on the part of the Council, we can reach agreement based on the pragmatic approach of our rapporteur.
I sincerely hope they will do so quickly.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, in light of this debate, attention should be drawn to the fact that the strategy being employed by the European Commission completely ignores employment in the maritime economy.
The lack of an integrated maritime policy has, for many years, been the cause of the systematic decay of this sector in the European Union, while we should be aware that it is an enormous labour market.
In addition, the marginalised shipbuilding industry, which has been efficiently eliminated in Europe by the dumping policy of states in the Far East, has also not gained the support of the European Commission.
In my country, Poland, alone, the actions of the European Commission have led to the collapse of the shipbuilding industry and, as a result, many thousands of people have lost their jobs directly, while it is estimated that indirect job losses have been suffered by nearly 80 000 people.
However, this sector will not disappear from the world economy.
Following the pattern of recent years, it will move to countries in the Far East, at the expense of the labour market in Europe.
The lack of a strategy to return ships to national colours is extremely dangerous.
As a result of this policy, Europe is irretrievably losing huge incomes, which will flow instead to tax havens.
Another extremely important element of European Commission policy is fishing which, not uncommonly, is the only sector that stimulates non-industrialised areas of the European Union.
The Commission is concentrating mainly on reducing the size of fleets while, at the same time, failing to curb mass imports to the European market from the Far East, such as of the highly damaging panga.
At a time of crisis, European Commission policy must create the basis for development of the economy, and not hastily treat the effects of erroneous strategy.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done in this report and on her speech just now.
This new microfinance facility will make it possible to grant micro-credit to small enterprises and people who have lost their jobs and who want to start up their own business and create their own jobs.
That is very important at a time when the economic crisis is expected to result in the loss of 3.5 million jobs in the European Union alone.
With the economic downturn, the banks have stopped giving out loans for start-ups and job creation, and access to credit is more difficult at a time when it ought to be more accessible.
This new microfinance scheme, however, will counter this current trend of restricting access to credit, by making it easier to obtain the funds needed to set up new businesses and create new jobs.
The Commission proposal is to reallocate EUR 100 million for this finance facility out of the Progress budget.
We cannot agree with this proposal.
The financial and economic crisis is also a social crisis.
Diverting resources from Progress, which targets the most vulnerable groups, is certainly not the most appropriate solution.
We are therefore in favour of creating a separate budget line to finance this facility, as well as increasing its appropriation to EUR 150 million.
We also agree with the need to make it clearer in the legislation itself that the target group is all vulnerable groups who are finding it difficult to enter or re-enter the labour market and who are facing the threat of social exclusion.
The reference to specific groups should therefore be deleted.
To conclude, I would stress that it is essential that the people who receive financial support should also be given appropriate training.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, against a backdrop of serious economic crisis, characterised by very severe effects on employment, with many workers standing to lose their jobs and, at the same time, countless young people not able to enter the labour market for the first time, it is essential that the European Union and the Member States take action, both with global strategies and with targeted instruments.
The microfinance facility is precisely an instrument targeted at people, the aim of which is to provide a response to all those individuals who, excluded from the bank credit market and having difficulty entering the labour market, intend to start a project, an economic activity, which, nonetheless, can generate individual income and thus contribute to overall growth.
In particular, if we want the micro-credit instrument to be effective and to yield lasting results, the Member States must prepare themselves sufficiently, including by establishing links at local administrative level, which is in more direct contact with situations of social crisis, and by taking an active role in making this new facility easily accessible.
It is important to stress that the long-term effectiveness of activities financed by micro-credit instruments and the possibility of fully achieving social integration largely depend on simultaneous guidance, mentoring and training programmes, which must accompany microfinance.
At the same time, given the objectives to be achieved with the micro-credit instrument, it is necessary to emphasise one crucial action, namely actively promoting equal opportunities for men and women in access to microfinance programmes.
In fact, it is women who are particularly discriminated against and disadvantaged, in terms of access to both the labour market and the conventional credit market.
Generally speaking, it is reassuring to note that the European Parliament is united and agrees on the issue of micro-credit and against such a socio-economic backdrop as this.
It is up to the Council and the Member States to show that they are serious and committed, and pave the way so that the financial situation can be set right.
(ET) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made a proposal to create a new means of financing - micro-credit financing.
The initiative is a good and important one, but the fact that it has been suggested that the resources needed for this should be taken from the already running Progress programme is not acceptable.
I would like to remind the Council and the Commission that the people did not elect us in this chamber in order to be a rubber stamp.
At the end of 2006, when we adopted the Progress programme here in this chamber, the Member States set their respective aims and began work.
The results from the programme were well executed, and there is no reason to think that the programme will not therefore continue running until it ends in 2013.
The programme was and is aimed at all those groups of people finding themselves in an unfavourable position, and there has been help available for them from this programme.
Today the economic crisis is growing into a social crisis.
Unemployment is increasing month after month, and today the Progress measures remain necessary.
At the same time, however, the Commission is going forward with its desire to reduce funding for the measures, which are still being implemented.
Such an approach is not responsible, and it is unacceptable.
I am sure that we in this chamber cannot approve micro-credit financing until it is clear where the money for these measures will come from - until it is clear that the funds will be found somewhere other than from plans targeted at all those people who are suffering.
(LV) Madam President, the economies of the EU States are still experiencing the effects of the global economic crisis, but the crisis is having the hardest impact on young entrepreneurs and managers of small enterprises, whose entrepreneurial ideas are, at the moment, not receiving support from lenders.
Economic growth takes place when new jobs are created.
New jobs are created when businesses have access to finance in order to make their ideas into a reality.
Unfortunately, in the current crisis situation, the banks do not want to lend money to enterprises because they are frightened of risk.
Private capital has also dried up.
In these circumstances, it is usually micro-enterprises and young entrepreneurs that suffer the most.
They have ideas for development, but no finance, and it is clear that if these enterprises cannot develop, then new jobs will not be created; the creation of jobs is, however, a prerequisite for emerging from the economic crisis.
One solution to this problem is the European microfinance instrument, which plans to allocate EUR 100 million to the development of micro-enterprises and new enterprises, reallocating resources from existing sources of money.
In contrast to the large stimulus packages which, over the last year, have been set up predominantly to rescue the financial system as such, this programme is aimed directly at entrepreneurs, not banks.
That means that this money will help in the most direct way to create new jobs and will stimulate the real economy.
I call upon my fellow Members not to hesitate in taking the decision to establish this microfinance programme.
The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now;
Europe needs new jobs now; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away.
(EL) Madam President, the mere fact that the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Integration won the consent and agreement of all the political groups proves how necessary this mechanism is.
It is very important that a person who has lost his job or is in danger of losing it and cannot find a solution to his problem on the conventional banking markets is able to obtain a micro-loan or micro-credit.
However, in order for the idea of microfinance to work in practice, it needs to operate properly and it needs to operate soon, meaning that on Thursday, when we vote on the 2010 budget, we need to say 'yes' to the first EUR 25 million which will come out of the budget.
However, that is not enough.
There is another EUR 75 million which I think needs to be found from the budget because, if we take the money from the Progress programme, then it is very simply as if we were taking from the less poor and vulnerable in order to give it to the more poor and vulnerable.
If this were to happen, it would mean that the mechanism of micro funding had essentially been abolished as a concept.
If we bear in mind that 'Progress' fundamentally means progress in taking the social face of Europe forward, and if this does not happen and the money is taken out of 'Progress', then we have regressed.
That is precisely why I believe that the Council should approve the European Parliament's position.
(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been adopting a variety of measures to combat the economic crisis for more than a year.
Unlike the other measures, the microfinance facility is actually intended to assist the most vulnerable groups in society who find it difficult to enter and return to the labour market.
Solidarity, which is one of the European Union's fundamental principles, dictates that they should receive special attention.
There is now a great deal of interest in this instrument, especially in Bulgaria, and I assume that this is the case in other countries too.
I have kept myself informed on this issue, right from the very start of the debates, through the media, many representatives of which are following its development.
It is in the European institutions' interest to demonstrate to the EU's citizens that our immediate task is to look after those affected by the crisis and the poorest members of society.
This will convince people that the institutions are effective and close to them.
There is some doubt about whether the facility will be able to reach and serve all its potential customers.
The lack of credit is huge and has contributed to the rise in unemployment.
EUR 100 million will not be sufficient to help all the unemployed facing the threat of social exclusion.
After all, not everyone has the skills to expand a business; not everyone could be successfully trained.
What is important is for a decision to be made more quickly and for the microfinance facility to start operating on as large a scale as possible, so that those with ideas and a flair for enterprise can get started now when the crisis is still severe.
Next year has been declared the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, so let us adopt proper measures and not delay the start of the recovery process.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can undoubtedly see promising signs of the stabilisation of the economy and the financial markets in 2010, and I would also like to remind you that this was only possible because it was coordinated at a European level.
However, we are, of course, seeing a rise in the unemployment figures and we have to assume that they will rise still further over the next year. I therefore welcome this new financing instrument for people who want to go self-employed.
It is, of course, common knowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises create jobs.
For many years, we have been discussing financial support for these enterprises.
However, every year, we discover that the funds have not gone where they were supposed to go.
I was able to follow the end of a pilot project last week, but as a result, there was not time to put the experiences gained from it in this report.
I would therefore like to mention it here.
The pilot project used participants who are self-employed or who want to go self-employed, and they were supported for a year along the path to self-employment.
It was so successful that I would like to call for it to be included in this project, in other words, that the project not only provide finance for people who are going self-employed, but also for those who support these people.
That is necessary because the banks, which will not, of course, give them credit, perceive a certain amount of risk in this regard.
I think we can neutralise this risk with this financing.
The second point that came up again and again in discussions in this regard was that we must not put a lower limit on the credits.
Up to now, someone could only receive credits of EUR 5 000 or more.
Sometimes, people do not need that amount.
In these cases, much smaller amounts are sufficient, and that is something that we should take into account in this programme.
(LT) I would like to underline that currently, one of the most important tasks for the European Union is to curb the mass unemployment caused by prolonged inactivity and the social crisis.
It is unfortunate that it was not possible to reach agreement on a microfinance source of funding during the trialogue.
During this difficult social and economic period, the Commission's proposal to reallocate EUR 100 million from the Progress budget would be an unsatisfactory solution, as it would not reduce the social isolation of the most vulnerable groups.
I am convinced that the microfinance facility will be more effective and will achieve its goal if it is coordinated by taking national, regional and local programmes into account and receives sufficient funding.
It is also important to take into consideration the fact that European social well-being is directly linked to employment and opportunities provided to find employment.
Therefore, I suggest that the Commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs, but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market.
Even before the onset of the economic recession, many educated and hard-working citizens had no real opportunities to find employment and therefore, a large number of them emigrated beyond the European Union.
As for socially disadvantaged people, I urge the Commission and the Council to bear in mind that apart from young people, there are other socially disadvantaged groups, including women, the disabled and the elderly, who need additional guarantees of employment.
Thus, there is no other way but to find additional funds for microfinance facilities.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Madam President, we have now listened to three or four speakers from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who have said that they do not want to take any money from Progress.
However, the amendments state that the instrument is to be called Progress, and Mrs Berès has also said that EUR 60 million will come from Progress.
That is two thirds!
I would be interested to know what the Socialists' position actually is.
Should the instrument be financed from Progress - yes or no?
(LT) I would like to answer that the best solution would be for us to find additional funds, because the Progress programme is essentially targeted at the same groups and this would mean that, if there is no additional funding, the effect will certainly not be achieved.
Therefore, let us sit down together and find a solution, because unemployment is growing at a painful rate and this is really affecting many people who are already struggling.
Madam President, three and a half million people lost their jobs in the European Union in the past year.
EUR 100 million is not going to turn that situation around.
In fact, when you consider that one hundred million people are employed by SMEs, it only comes to one euro per employee.
Nevertheless, it is a start, and it is to be welcomed because, as Commissioner Špidla pointed out, financing is the biggest issue at hand.
To illustrate that: I became aware at the weekend of a situation where a company, which had a significant order delayed for three months, went to its bank - the bank it had been dealing with for 15 years - for bridging finance.
It was refused.
The company director was told that if he took out a mortgage on his own dwelling house, then they would allow him.
He did this, and a week later he got a letter withdrawing the overdraft facility on the grounds that they were now in a high-risk situation.
The result was that the company closed down and 10 more people were made redundant.
That brings me to a point which my colleague, Marian Harkin, mentioned, that, as far as possible, this funding should go to non-commercial banks like credit unions which, in my country anyway, are in every town and do tremendous work, whereas all the anecdotal evidence would suggest that the commercial banks, even with the finance they were getting from the European Investment Bank, are not giving it out but rather keeping it to shore up their own financial situation.
For those two reasons, I think we should be very careful of not so much where the money comes from, but where it goes to.
If it goes to the right people, then it would be the best money we will spend perhaps for a long time here at European level.
Finally, I would like to respond to the rather ill-advised comments by the Earl when he spoke about the begging hand.
This is not about a begging hand.
This is about helping those to help others to create employment and to stay in employment.
We are very proud and glad that we joined the euro, and we will be staying.
(FR) Madam President, the clause in the Treaty of Lisbon on social policies requires the European Union to take into account employment, social protection and the fight against social exclusion.
The economic and financial crisis which has overrun Europe has led to a very serious human and social crisis, and this will have consequences that are impossible to assess at the moment.
Until now, the majority of efforts have been devoted to stabilising the banks and preventing bankruptcies.
In addition to measures to prevent unemployment, we must create a mechanism to give renewed impetus to the European Union's economic growth.
The mechanism used by the Commission is designed to create an infrastructure which, in turn, will enable citizens to work.
At the practical level, it is possible to move from a temporary strategy to a long-term strategy.
This mechanism must be put in place quickly, in January 2010.
Our debate today and our decisions are heard by many people who are suffering from inequality and by many young people who want to enter the working world and to whom we should just give a helping hand.
I would mention again the proposal already made to create a separate budget heading of EUR 50 million for this mechanism.
That will enable approximately 6 000 European entrepreneurs to start their own businesses, to develop them and thus to create new jobs.
In addition, and this is the most important thing, it is vital to improve access to resources and, above all, to provide better information to citizens about all the projects to which they can apply.
(PL) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of Europeans have felt the effects of the economic crisis in a way which has hit them hardest, for they have lost their jobs.
In every country of the European Union, the rate of unemployment has risen, and this is the feature of the crisis which most disturbs our citizens.
Essential help is reaching financial institutions.
Unfortunately, help is not reaching people at risk of losing their job in time, and it is they who will feel the effects of the present crisis the longest.
Therefore, I, too, am pleased about the establishment of the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion.
Especially worthy of note is the combining of this facility with the general objective of support for entrepreneurship.
Funds supplied with the help of this facility will stimulate the establishment of new businesses.
This is good news for our economy, because it is small and medium-sized enterprises which are its foundation, and it is SMEs which create jobs.
The facility fits in perfectly with the concept of support for entrepreneurship presented in the Charter for Small Enterprises.
It is important that businesses also receive that help at a later stage, and not only at the setting up stage, because financial resources from this facility will bring benefits to the people who use them and to economies only when the businesses which are set up are able to survive in the market.
I also hope that entrepreneurship, particularly as it concerns SMEs, will not just be the subject of our debates during the crisis.
We should adopt a comprehensive approach to entrepreneurship, because these businesses provide jobs for our citizens not just during a crisis.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans.
As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women.
It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people.
By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions.
I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last month, the Commission has presented its new EU Strategy 2020 as a continuation of the Lisbon goals and, among other things, has called for a more social Europe.
If we are striving to ensure lasting employment for Europe's citizens, then, particularly now in this difficult economic situation, we need to ensure that people can implement their own good ideas themselves in order to generate their own income.
The EU microfinance facility for employment is intended to provide the opportunity for a new start and to smooth the path to entrepreneurship.
The path to self-employment often goes in stages.
Initial small investments are easier to cope with than to pile up large mountains of debt.
A more manageable risk for starting out in self-employment is something that women, in particular, seek and they often ask for start-up capital in order to secure the start of the business and then, when the business is going well, to expand.
Women want to grow with their businesses.
Therefore, citizens need to be offered credit amounts that are as small as possible.
By that I mean amounts significantly lower than EUR 25 000, which is the amount generally provided for micro-credits.
Particularly during the economic crisis, the necessary liquidity needs to be provided to the population at large.
If this provides a way to help to keep the often high rates of interest and administrative fees for micro-credits low, then it would give us an opportunity to give new impetus to the economy.
I welcome the idea presented in the Commission proposal.
The European Parliament committees disagree about the financing.
Questioning the jurisdiction of European policy is certainly permissible in this area.
The Member States have the prime responsibility.
As I see it, however, funds from the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (Progress), particularly as proposed here, will enable people to go self-employed.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are discussing issues that are truly at the social heart of our society today - discussing mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund earlier, and, let us hope, of Progress in the coming days - and this European fund for microfinance is the ideal and essential instrument.
I believe that it is pointless to keep reiterating that this is what solves or attempts to solve the problems of the most needy citizens, which makes them more confident and more hopeful with regard to entrepreneurship and with regard to the future, so I believe that here we are not thinking of the damage caused by this perfect storm of crises and we are hearing much talk of the exit strategy, of how to get out of this crisis.
We will only get out of it if we solve the problem of employment, which is our tragedy, so we should seek to ensure that things move as quickly as possible and ensure that firm guarantees are in place regarding the resources for this facility since we should mobilise much larger resources than those we have heard discussed this evening and certainly should not divert money from one instrument to another, since all three need this money.
I believe that this EUR 100 million absolutely should not be taken from Progress since it also has the same objectives, but it should be a completely distinct and different budget line and must guarantee the mobilisation of much larger resources.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument.
This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses.
In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected.
In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union.
The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true.
We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people.
In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business.
I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too.
The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow.
Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans.
I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe's most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young.
The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply.
Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund.
It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis.
Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment.
It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme.
These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the fundamental importance of micro-credit in these times of crisis for jobs.
Micro-credit allows the unemployed to make a new start, thanks to risk-sharing and financing instruments, making entrepreneurship accessible.
Given the financial crisis and the significant drop in the number of loans being granted, I support the proposal by the European Commission to establish a microfinance instrument targeting the most vulnerable groups, and particularly women, young people and the unemployed.
I would like to give my backing to my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party which, together with the other groups - socialists, liberals and conservatives - have tabled compromise amendments in order to set up this microfinance instrument as quickly as possible, starting in 2010.
I also call upon the Council of Ministers to take responsibility for finding, in the current crisis situation, a swift solution to combat unemployment and provide a lasting solution to the funding of this micro-credit.
(PL) Madam President, the Progress programme is an important initiative intended to help Member States effectively implement objectives in the areas of employment and social affairs.
Last week, I had a meeting with the members of the programme committee concerning implementation of the Progress programme.
My conclusions are as follows. Firstly, the advertising campaign, which should introduce potential beneficiaries of the programme to the scope of its operation, is not being conducted in a sufficiently visible way.
Secondly, most of the information about tenders and competitions is available in only three languages: English, German and French.
This constitutes a functional barrier for people who do not speak any of these languages.
I think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for.
We should, as quickly as possible, increase recognition of the Progress programme and disseminate knowledge about it throughout the entire Union.
(RO) The Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion supports and must support the application of simple procedures so that those affected can benefit from this in an effective manner.
However, I believe that the microfinance facility should be focused more on people who have lost their jobs and are at a disadvantage in terms of access to the traditional credit market, and who want to set up or continue to develop their own micro-enterprise, including as a self-employed activity.
I think that special attention must be focused on young people who, unfortunately, going by the recent European statistics, are facing ever-longer periods of unemployment or are hired on a temporary basis.
In addition, an annual report on the use of the budget allocated will enable a serious analysis to be carried out in the near future and, if necessary, a top-up to be provided for this budget.
If we transfer sums from one programme to another, we run the risk of undermining both.
(DE) Madam President, today we have discussed the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and now we are talking about micro-credits.
Both instruments are absolutely essential to combat the effects of the financial and economic crisis in the EU and to stimulate the European labour market.
We need both instruments, as not everyone is destined to be an entrepreneur.
Neither should it be the goal of our employment policy to make new self-employed entrepreneurs out of former employees and the non-self-employed workforce purely for business reasons.
For such people, the term 'putative self-employed' would be more appropriate.
The Member States must also take appropriate precautionary steps in this regard.
However, for all of those who want to accept the challenge of self-employment, the resources must be made available to allow them to start or expand their business.
Along with this, however, it must be ensured - and this is the duty of the European Parliament and the Member States - that normal social security continues to be provided.
We need new money for new ideas.
(LT) I believe that today, MEPs are completely unanimous in their opinion that this microfinance support facility is now very necessary.
Living and working conditions have changed fundamentally and the scourge of unemployment that has affected almost every state is forcing us to put forward certain proposals that certain support facilities should be amended.
Until now, most financial support was earmarked for large companies and organisations and on many occasions, it has been underscored that until now, ordinary European Union citizens have had little or no hope of financial support.
I believe that the Commission's future solution to seek agreement together with the European Parliament is absolutely essential.
100 million is the very beginning.
It is a first attempt, but I am convinced that this attempt may be successful.
Ladies and gentlemen, the discussion has clearly shown Parliament's support for the micro-financing instrument and I believe there are no fundamental disputes as far as the substance of the issue is concerned. I also believe that there is considerable proximity to the position of the Council as far as the substance of the issue is concerned.
It is the issue of financing that remains open.
Of course, the issue of finance is also part of the codecision process, which means that it will be highly necessary and desirable to look for a compromise and I am delighted that the debate has signalled a great willingness to resume negotiations with the Council without delay.
At the same time, the debate has indicated the possibility of compromise in some areas.
The debate saw frequent mention and frequent criticism of the Commission over the issue of the Progress programme and its use within the framework of this new instrument.
I have to say that the Commission was not faced with a simple issue because it had to move within the framework of the existing budget or within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement.
It was only able to use money which was available.
When weighing up our decision concerning the use of Progress programme resources, we very carefully considered the consequences and came to the conclusion that although it was not an ideal solution, it was probably one of the possible solutions.
It was repeatedly asserted in the debate that this involved some sleight of hand or shifting of money from one pot to another.
That is not the case, since all of the analyses show clearly that resources used within the framework of the micro-credit principle are subject to an estimated five-fold multiplier effect.
In the other programme, these resources would achieve an index of 1 while in the micro-credit programme, they can theoretically achieve an index of up to 5.
From this perspective, it is not a matter simply of transferring from one pot to another but of a new use for the resources.
I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision, and I do not even think that it was the only decision and, in the debate over a compromise, a decent basis will surely be found, or at least I hope so.
The idea of micro-credit is based on a clear statement that the current financial system does not provide sufficient sources for small and very small enterprises in particular, in other words, that the system does not make use of the human capital that is present in people who belong to so-called vulnerable groups.
I consider this to be a great waste of an opportunity and I am therefore delighted that the Commission has proposed this instrument and I am also delighted that Parliament rates it so highly.
As I have already said, the idea is to make use of the human capital that is in people who would normally not be able to make use of their capital in this entrepreneurial way.
However, it is also very important to make use of time.
In my opinion, holding an unduly long debate would be against the very sense of this instrument which is particularly needed in a time of crisis.
I also believe that it will be needed in times when there is no crisis and that it will become a permanent component of European labour market and economic policy.
Thank you for the supportive remarks and comments.
Allow me to share the view of those who expressed their disappointment due to the Commission's lack of willingness to compromise.
I must also say to the Commissioner that if we reallocate what are exclusively Progress resources, this conveys the message that, when it comes to resources for social inclusion, we can only envisage support for the most vulnerable if we take the resources from places serving the same purpose.
We are unable to find any other kind of resources.
I think that this is unacceptable.
The codecision procedure also means that everyone, each party, must take steps.
Parliament came up with a number of suggestions and proposals on this matter, whereas there was no such proposal forthcoming from the Council and Commission which would have helped reach agreement.
I must say to Elisabeth Schroeder that the fact that we are defending the Progress programme here conveys our conviction - which is a shared conviction that we are still willing to come to a compromise on this - that this programme must be implemented as soon as possible.
The assistance provided will only be effective if the facility can be launched at the start of 2010.
If Parliament actually votes on this matter this week, then it will have done, for its part, what it can to ensure that this programme is launched at the start of 2010.
As Parliament will presumably vote for the EUR 25 million from its own resources for next year, and if Parliament votes for the entire amount, this will be sufficient for the Commission to sign the agreements which can facilitate the programme's launch.
I believe that this reflects Parliament's constructive approach.
At any rate, I consider that this programme is extremely important from a social inclusion perspective.
I would also like to ask those of my fellow Members who supported this to agree for us not to take the entire resources from the Progress programme and to lobby their own governments as well for resources, given that these countries' governments are the members of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The economic crisis has become an acutely felt social crisis for which we have not yet found a solution.
Unfortunately, one of the indicators which could help launch a recovery, the level of lending, has reached a record low in the euro area since 1991 and is experiencing an unprecedented collapse in the new Member States, as is the case for Romania.
This is one of the elements which cast doubt on the prospects for beating the recession.
Against this background, I appreciate the welcome proposal from the European Commission on setting up the microfinance facility.
However, in order to ensure that social inclusion measures are effective, the facility needs to be entered in a separate budget line.
The reallocation of the funds from the Progress programme would affect its specific guidelines for community action and send out an alarm signal concerning the social openness of a European executive, which has been extremely reluctant until now, unfortunately, in terms of displaying sufficient social involvement.
The crisis is affecting every category of vulnerable people, but we cannot ignore the severity of youth unemployment.
The fact that one young person in five in Europe does not have a job may have numerous repercussions at an economic and social level, as well as from a demographic and crime perspective.
This is why I think that it is appropriate to have a greater focus on boosting young people's chances of entering the job market.
Since autumn last year, more than 5 million European citizens have lost their jobs, giving a total of 22.5 million unemployed in Europe.
In this context, we cannot ignore the serious level of unemployment among young people.
It is deeply concerning that one young person in five in Europe does not have a job, which has repercussions at an economic and social level, as well as from a demographic and crime perspective.
In some countries, the percentage of young people out of work is even higher in proportion to the national unemployment rate as well.
For instance, one young Latvian in three is unemployed, while approximately 43% of Spanish citizens under the age of 25 are affected by this problem.
I think that more attention needs to be focused on young people.
In this respect, the initiative put forward by the European Commission on microfinance programmes which are entered in a separate budget line will help encourage and motivate young people to enter the labour market, thereby reducing the unemployment rate which has risen among this group.
The current efforts being made at both EU and national level must be stepped up in order to boost the offer of micro-credits.
The European Microfinance Facility must provide useful assistance to the unemployed and vulnerable people who would like to set up or run micro-enterprises.
I believe that the European Microfinance Facility must have a separate credit line as the beneficiaries of this scheme are different to those for the Progress programme.
Progress programme funds must not, under any circumstances, be reduced during this crisis period as they are targeted at the most vulnerable groups.
I also believe that the European Microfinance Facility should have a sufficiently large budget to make it really effective in achieving its objectives in terms of employment and social inclusion.
Member States and the EU as a whole must continue to implement the Progress programme effectively at a time of global economic crisis

The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation (
Before the vote:
Mr President, I would like to thank all of those who have taken part in the preparation of this report.
I would just like to point out that when we get to paragraph 31, there is an oral amendment.
As agreed, I will now read the second part of the English version.
'Considers it appropriate, therefore, to explore the grounds for an agreement with creditor countries to establish a temporary moratorium or debt cancellation for the poorest countries to enable them to implement countercyclical fiscal policies to mitigate the severe effects of the crisis; proposes that efforts be made to facilitate arrangements for transparent debt arbitration'.
In any case, Mr Guerrero, if we have not been misinformed, this oral amendment affects paragraph 34 and not paragraph 31.
(Mr Guerrero indicated that it did indeed affect the second part of paragraph 34)
Now it is all clear.
(The vote took place)
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on paragraph 22:
(FR) Mr President, we have brought to your attention an oral amendment concerning paragraph 22.
I would point out that paragraph 22 relates to global governance and, in particular, to the composition of the G20, which, unusually, does not include in its ranks any representatives from the least developed countries.
The oral amendment aims to fill this gap, and the text that I propose to the European Parliament meets this need.
(FR) Mr President, you called for applause for the Tunisian delegation a moment ago.
Could you ask the Tunisian delegation to intervene to obtain the release of Taoufik Ben Brik, which the whole of Parliament is calling for?
(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order.
I am very happy about the way that the vote has gone.
However, this was essentially an own-initiative report and a different procedure has been agreed in this case.
Now we have been allowed to have individual votes on an own-initiative report.
We need to resolve this or all own-initiative reports will have individual votes in future.
Could you perhaps ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify this issue?
Otherwise, the interpretation made by the House's services will defeat the whole object of the reform.
Mr Swoboda, it can be done.
It is possible to request split votes, in accordance with the procedure that the groups themselves sought.
At any rate, everything can be revised. It could be revised in the future, but for the moment, that is how it is.

Commission White Paper: "Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action" (
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is a real threat that we must be ready to face despite the varying impact it will have on our countries.
The degradation of ecosystems will cause a severe blow to the health of our economies and of European citizens.
We have already in the past called for climate diplomacy and justice: now we have to build it, speaking with a single voice.
I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the lead in the battle against climate change and that any delay in implementing that action will increase environmental, social and economic costs out of all proportion.
We must first of all recognise the central role of local and regional authorities and the need to work with them to coordinate environmental and economic innovation facilitated by technological progress.
By adopting the White Paper, we call on the Commission and Member States to promote public-private partnerships to help finance all of the initiatives tied to the adaptation policies.
Each square metre of our territory has to be cared for to preserve the soil and retain water so as to prevent erosion and to supply the aquifers, including through direct reinjection of surface waters.
In order for adaptation to be possible, a systemic approach which includes renewable energies will be necessary.
I would like to warmly thank all of my colleagues who contributed to the success of this report.

Closure of the sitting
Implemented reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova (debate)
The first item is the Commission statement on implemented reforms and developments in the Republic of Moldova.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, when looking at EU-Moldova relations, I believe it is uncontroversial that we have achieved a lot of progress in record time, but domestically the country still faces many challenges.
The referendum of 5 September was meant to resolve the political deadlock by changing the rules for electing the President. It failed.
That is regrettable. However, whether the referendum would comply with democratic standards was also an important question.
Crucially, its effective compliance has been confirmed by the international observers. This is an encouraging sign.
The elections of 28 November are equally important for the consolidation of democracy in the country.
We will continue sending firm messages in that respect to all stakeholders.
Thereafter, all political forces will have to work together, both to elect a President and to choose a government capable of taking the country through a critical reform path.
At the same time, we will sustain our unwavering support to the structural reforms conducted by the Moldovan Government.
Let me highlight a few important aspects.
The European Union is not only by far the largest donor to Moldova, but in March also succeeded in mobilising over forty donors to support Moldova's reforms.
They pledged an impressive EUR 1.9 billion for the years 2010-2013, including our own EUR 550 million commitment.
Over the last months, we have provided timely responses to a number of the government's specific needs: providing high-level policy advice to ministers; supporting democratisation efforts in rule-of-law related areas; helping organise the electoral consultations; addressing emergency needs after last summer's floods; and improving possibilities for Moldovan wine exports.
Alongside the Moldovan government, we have actively engaged with the population living in the Transnistrian region via small-scale projects, mostly in the social area.
Next year, we will start implementing the Comprehensive Institution-Building programme under the Eastern Partnership.
That programme will help Moldova prepare for, and implement, the Association Agreement that we are currently negotiating.
The latest round of negotiations in Chisinau on 13 and 14 October demonstrated yet again that these negotiations are progressing at a very good speed.
Our assistance has also taken the form of direct transfers to the Moldovan budget.
Since the last quarter of 2009, EUR 37 million has been disbursed as sectoral budget support, with an additional EUR 15 million to come soon.
Out of this, about EUR 8.5 million was directly allocated to help the poorest strata of the population.
Now that President Buzek has signed the relevant legislative decision, we expect to disburse soon the EUR 40 million of the first tranche of macro-financial assistance.
In the same spirit, we will carry on our busy schedule of political contacts and technical exchanges.
In a few days, I will meet with Prime Minister Filat, in Luxembourg.
In November, the EU-Moldova trade sub-committee will examine Moldova's response to the Commission's key recommendations in view of preparing negotiations on a deep and comprehensive free trade area.
Additionally, we have engaged with Moldova in a dedicated Dialogue on Human Rights and in an energy dialogue, and are negotiating an aviation services agreement.
We have actively followed up on the visa dialogue launched in June.
Next Monday, drawing on the outcome of the fact-finding missions conducted in September by independent experts, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to release conclusions that should address this issue.
The purpose of this debate is for us to discuss the reforms carried out by the Republic of Moldova during the last year and the progress made on the path to European integration.
This country has been on the European Union's agenda for a year because it has met its commitments.
I would like to mention some of those commitments.
A plan has been drawn up with priority measures to be carried out in essential areas of reform, along with another plan for justice reform.
Implementation of both plans has started.
Dialogue on human rights has been initiated.
In addition, the parliament of the Republic of Moldova ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court in September.
Intensive negotiations are being conducted on the Association Agreement, with excellent results.
Only a year has gone by, but those involved in starting the process guarantee that it will continue.
The Republic of Moldova is the state which has made the furthest progress within the EU's Eastern Partnership.
This is why I am asking the Council to assess this state individually on its own merits.
Progress signifies political will, hard work and dedication, which need to be rewarded.
We rewarded the Western Balkans for the measures they have taken.
Let us go ahead and do the same for the Republic of Moldova too.
In the dialogue on visas Moldova has made great progress in all four areas.
This is why I am asking the Council at the next session on 25 October to invite the Commission to draw up an action plan so that citizens from the Republic of Moldova can travel without requiring visas.
Direct contact between people is worth more than any declaration.
In the case of the Transnistria region, a solution is vital for the political and economic stability of the Republic Moldova and this region.
The EU must play a stronger role at a political level and we must be involved through joint projects making changes which people can see.
Finally, the European integration process has helped build democracy and freedom at an unprecedented rate in European history.
Let us look in Central and Eastern Europe at how the situation has changed in the last 20 years.
Peace now reigns in the Western Balkans too and reforms are under way.
Let us do what is necessary to achieve the same situation in the Republic of Moldova as well.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the Republic of Moldova has a single option - between 'Transnistrialisation' and 'Europeanisation'.
That is to say between an oligarchic past of a Soviet nature and a future of security, prosperity and social justice.
Moldova's development has so far been negatively influenced by its internal political instability.
The fundamental problem of the Republic of Moldova is not linked to the external challenges it faces, but to the internal division among political forces.
That internal political instability has denied the ruling coalition the time to implement its pro-European options.
Moldova now faces a turning point.
The outcome of this early election should aim to lead the country towards a future of European modernisation.
Therefore, we call on all political forces in Moldova that are proposing a future of European modernisation for the country to avoid any unnecessary protagonism or confrontation, and to concentrate on developing a broad vision with the aim of directing the country towards achieving its European goals.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, eighteen months ago this House was shocked by the brutality of the events in Chisinau.
A few weeks later, we had the great pleasure of welcoming here in our gallery the leaders of the democratic political parties from that country, embarked on a new path.
We shared the enthusiasm of Moldova's people for a new future.
We have been pleased to note since then the progress that country has made.
There is still much progress to be made - not least in bringing to justice the perpetrators of those brutal events - but, if Moldova returns to office the current coalition in the elections next month, there is a good chance that, despite the difficulties of the economic recession, the country can complete its transformation.
The British writer, Francis Bacon, observed that hope makes a very good breakfast but a rather poor supper.
Moldova's governing parties should be in no doubt that implementation of reforms must follow the legal acts which permit such reforms.
Time is not on our side.
There is much to be done very soon.
My group commends Commissioner Füle and his services for the work they have done to assist Moldova.
We welcome the formation of the Friends of Moldova and the superb meeting of European countries which took place to help Moldova to move forward.
Every effort is being made on the European Union's side to help this desperately poor country move towards European standards.
I hope that when the Council looks at the visa regime next week it will help us to find a way forward on the visa issue.
As one of our founding fathers said, a country's European vocation is determined not by the European Union but by the European spirit of its people.
We urge the people of Moldova to show that European spirit in the elections next month.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we welcome the progress made by the Republic of Moldova and hope that the forthcoming electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and ensure respect for the rule of law and of human rights in Moldova.
We know that there is broad support for Moldova's future EU membership - not NATO membership - within Moldovan society.
In spite of their different political platforms, all parties represented in the Moldovan Parliament declare that they are for European cooperation and integration as well.
But, taking into account my own country of Latvia's experience of EU membership, I have tried to explain during my conversations with Moldovan politicians that EU membership cannot be an end in itself.
It is very important to step up efforts to implement deep and consistent economic and judicial reforms, notably through the fight against corruption.
Moldovan society is multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic; moreover, essential differences exist in relation to the assessment of historical events.
It is therefore quite dangerous to create additional dividing lines within Moldovan society.
In my opinion, a recent decree establishing 28 June as Soviet Occupation Day, which triggered a negative reaction on the part of a large number of Moldovan residents, did not consolidate society but had just the opposite effect.
Moldovan society also varies according to the nationality held by its residents.
The large proportion of residents having dual citizenship creates additional differences in respect of rights as well, and so we have to make every effort to abolish these differences and to provide a visa-free regime for all Moldovans.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, no one is disputing that Moldova has a long way to go before it achieves its ultimate goal of joining the European Union, which is a goal that my group, the ECR, supports.
It remains one of Europe's poorest countries, despite being in the WTO, and, as such, is vulnerable to organised crime, human trafficking and corruption.
Moldova remains hamstrung by the ongoing frozen conflict with the Russian-speaking and politically Russian- dominated breakaway region of Transnistria.
However, since the Communists were ousted from power 15 months ago, Moldova has begun to make substantial progress.
The parties in the Alliance for European Integration, the current ruling coalition, have shown an impressive capacity to work together to accelerate Moldova's integration with the European Union.
For its part, the Union should maintain pressure on the Moldovan Government for further progress in economic reforms and, in particular, improving the rule of law and good governance.
But we should also reward and engage more with Chisinau.
The visa issue has been mentioned, but I would also like to raise the issue of Euronest, which offers opportunities for EU and Moldovan politicians alike to debate common interests.
Sadly, Euronest - which was something which appeared in my report in the previous parliament - remains paralysed because of the dispute over Belarus representation, as our Parliament does not recognise its parliament, which was not democratically elected.
I hope that one day all clearly European countries in the Eastern Partnership, namely Moldova, Ukraine and a future democratic Belarus, will become EU candidates.
Mr President, this debate demonstrates Europe's commitment to the divided Republic of Moldova, and I am extremely pleased about that.
In my country, the Netherlands, citizens have for many years been developing some inspiring social initiatives offering young people from Moldova genuine prospects.
In this context I would also like to mention with pride the Orhei Foundation in Bunschoten-Spakenburg, a village which tackles such things with great vigour.
I can look the people of this Foundation in the eye because we are also talking about this issue here, demonstrating commitment.
Incidentally, Moldova is seeking an in-depth, comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union.
Commissioner Füle also mentions this.
Commissioner, what is the situation with regard to this, and has any genuine progress been made yet?
A broadening of the sales opportunities for Moldovan products, particularly agricultural products and wines from Chişinău, is vital, since Moldova's main traditional sales market, Russia, regularly closes and restricts its borders for political reasons.
Commissioner, you have already mentioned this, but is there any way in which the European Union can offer comfort in response to this need on the part of Moldova?
Finally, a question about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's 'Meseberg initiative'.
Is Russia now genuinely committed to finding a solution to the Transnistria question in exchange for enhanced political dialogue between the EU and Russia?
I am hearing noises indicating that the Kremlin is not taking any action for the time being.
Commissioner, I would in particular like to wish you much success and perseverance in your efforts to bring Moldova closer to Europe.
Mr President, there is ample proof that Moldova's commitment to European values and standards is genuine and effective.
Moldova is actually the best example of implementing pro-European policies among our Eastern neighbours.
In actual fact, Moldova's euro-credentials make it fully compatible with Western Balkan states.
The positive precedent set by Moldova should be acknowledged and encouraged.
The deterioration of democratic institutions in neighbouring Ukraine increases the importance of Moldova for the EU's policies on its eastern flank.
In this context, it is vital that the general elections on 28 November confirm Moldova's continued drive towards European integration.
It is indeed high time for the EU to send a positive signal to Moldova and the Moldovans.
Thousands of Moldovan families are divided by a visa barrier.
The EU-Moldova visa dialogue presents us with a huge opportunity.
This dialogue should enter an operational phase.
Let us hope that the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 October will invite the Commission to draw up an action plan for visa liberalisation.
A pro-European, integrated Moldova would have a beneficial effect on the EU's eastern frontier, where weak governance and unsolved conflicts are a continuous threat to European stability.
(BG) The challenges Moldova is currently facing, which are also part of our overall objective, include strengthening the multi-ethnic state, its identity, the political settlement of the Transnistrian problem and Moldova's membership of the European Union as an autonomous, independent state.
The visa liberalisation process is particularly important.
As we have seen in similar cases for the countries of former Yugoslavia, it delivers good results.
The tendency to use a fast-track procedure for issuing Bulgarian and Romanian passports simultaneously to Moldovan citizens is not a solution to this problem and entails certain risks.
At the same time, the authorities in Chişinau must ensure that the benefit of the EUR 90 million in macro-financial assistance which the European Union is granting will be felt by all Moldovan citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin.
This is especially important for the Bulgarian minority in Moldova as well, which lives in one of the poorest economic regions in the country.
(RO) As a member of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee Delegation, it has been a pleasure for me to follow Moldova's positive progress and I can confirm that the Republic of Moldova's commitment to the European path has been very clearly demonstrated during the last year.
I would like to remind you at this point of the reforms made to the economy, justice system and public administration.
At the same time, we must be realistic and acknowledge that the transition process in Moldova is not easy and many reforms are still to be implemented.
I am pleased that progress is being made in the discussions aimed at visa liberalisation.
However, I think that we need the Commission to establish a clear road map for achieving this objective and, why not, for getting rid of visas in the future altogether.
The Republic of Moldova will have a crucial test to get through during the parliamentary elections on 28 November and I hope that the European path which the country has committed to will be approved by the population and continue.
Macro-financial and political assistance from European institutions and some Member States has been of paramount importance.
Given the positive results from our policy, I ask Europe's institutions - Parliament, the Council and the European Commission - to continue their actions in support of Moldova in order to give Moldova confidence and encourage it to continue along the path of reform and rapprochement with the European Union so that it can ultimately become integrated as a full member.
(PL) Ten days ago, I had the opportunity to visit Moldova as part of a special delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with, amongst others, fellow Members Mrs Macovei and Mr Watson.
We were in Moldova at an extremely important moment for the country - several weeks after the unsuccessful constitutional referendum of 5 September and also several weeks before very important parliamentary elections, which, as you know, will be held on 28 November.
Above all, what we saw was the very large support of the nation and Moldavian society for the process of European integration.
Nearly three quarters of Moldavians support this process.
We also saw the huge progress which has been made by the government of Prime Minister Filat on the road to European integration and the many reforms, including significant progress in the fight against corruption which had previously been eating away at the country.
Of course, problems do exist: problems resulting from the economic crisis and problems resulting from the as yet unresolved situation in Transnistria.
However, in order for the process of reforms to be continued after 28 November, a clear signal from the European Union is needed, so I am hoping that the forthcoming Council summit will manage to push through the visa liberalisation process.
(RO) I too would like to thank all those who have made this debate possible.
It is our duty to look towards the Republic of Moldova with a sense of great responsibility, especially now with the elections approaching.
The government of the Alliance for European Integration has shown through the special effort it has made that it is ready to launch an extensive process of political, economic and institutional reforms, thereby leading the way in this area within the Eastern Partnership.
This is taking place after eight years of Communist government when basic rights such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to fair justice were seriously violated.
The reform process in the Republic of Moldova must continue predominantly in the area of justice and internal affairs.
An effective battle must be waged against corruption, and freedom of justice guaranteed.
At the same time, safe and humane detention must be ensured so that fundamental human rights are respected.
The Republic of Moldova has been going through a political crisis for well over 18 months now, with the failure of the presidential election and the validation of the referendum.
I believe that the forthcoming elections on 28 November are a huge gamble for Moldova's path towards Europe.
Democracy is once again going through a difficult test.
I wish to state with full responsibility that a failure for democracy in the Republic of Moldova at the forthcoming elections will also mark, to a small extent, a failure for the EU's policy in this country.
We need to have in the immediate vicinity of the EU a partner which assumes the values we share.
I wish to end by emphasising that the language spoken by the Republic of Moldova's citizens is now an official language of the European Union.
This is also another reason why it should receive our support.
(BG) I am pleased that the European Parliament is devoting its time to discussing the situation in Moldova, a country which is essentially European.
In this respect, we must say that the ruling Coalition for European Integration actually contributed a great deal to the process of bringing Moldova closer to the European Union and it must be given great credit for this.
At the same time, its citizens expect more results in the areas of the economy and social development.
It is no coincidence that this is also turning into the key issue in the current campaign.
Establishing relations with the European Union is not a one-off event.
It is a long-term process and Moldova's path towards rapprochement must become an irreversible policy.
Failure to amend the constitution led to this state of political instability, which is at risk of being repeated after the present elections.
This is why I am making an appeal to the leading political forces, irrespective of differences and the election result, to do what is required to guarantee political stability in Moldova, which will give them the chance to act in the interest of their citizens and of their country's European future.
(RO) Romanian imperialism is how Moldova's Communists describe the interest being shown and speeches being made by MPs in Romania regarding the situation in Chişinău, regardless of whether it is President Băsescu or MEPs.
In other words, the Communists in Chişinău would like Bucharest to shut up.
In my own view, I must say that I do not think that they are entitled to expect this.
On the contrary, it is our duty to speak out.
The main reason for this is that a large number of primarily European, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, and other citizens too, live in the Republic of Moldova.
I believe that, just like any other European citizen, those living in Moldova should also enjoy the rights which derive from their political status.
Secondly, we must keep a very close eye on Chişinău because a coalition government there has been acting for well over a year in the name of European integration.
It is not only about the name this coalition has.
Certainly, if it had been called the Alliance for Russia, we would not have shown as much interest in it.
It has been called the Alliance for European Integration, but it is not just the name that matters, but the very brave action of this government.
Mrs Macovei and Commissioner Füle have explained what this brave action entails.
I was in Chişinău and Tiraspol last week and I noticed that becoming European is also at stake in the election campaign which is due to start for the November elections.
Moldova's citizens will actually decide not only between different political forces, but also between continuing and abandoning its path towards Europe.
Let us not fool ourselves.
I saw that even the head of the EU delegation in Chişinău is starting to fool himself.
The Communists do not want integration.
The Communists demonstrated a year and a few months ago what they want.
The demonstrations in April provided very clear proof of where the interests of the Communists in Chişinău lie.
This is why I hope that citizens will understand the message and attitudes of the parties, and that politicians themselves will also understand the wishes of the people expressed at the ballot box.
(PL) Let us ask ourselves why we are devoting so much attention to such a small country which lies in the vicinity of the Black Sea but does not have access to it.
Perhaps the reason we are talking about Moldova is because it is a small country where two worlds meet.
One of these, which once symbolised the Soviet Union, is with great difficulty becoming a thing of the past.
Moldova is a divided country.
Part of it is under occupation and is being supported by external forces.
I think this country deserves our support.
It is a small country, which is home to very brave people who want to come closer to the European Union and to build a democracy.
Commissioner, the situation with Moldova is reminiscent of the concept in physics in which it is not the force itself which is important, but the point at which it is applied.
These millions of euro of which you spoke are not very impressive.
It is only a small amount of money, but applied at the right point and at the right moment it can bring about the positive effect we want.
I wish success to all those who want to build democracy in Moldova.
I am not interested in party affiliation, but I would like Moldova to consolidate, to build a better future for itself and to become our partner in the near future.
(SK) The progress Moldova has made so far indicates that this country could become an example of a success story of a participant in the Eastern Partnership of the European Union.
The current pro-European government led by the Alliance for European Integration presented the citizens of Moldova with a clear and important political perspective for the future democratic progress of the country.
However, it is also true that the internal political situation has been negatively affected by the long-lasting disagreement on constitutional reform.
Following the unsuccessful referendum, the upcoming elections ought to overcome the impasse in the political negotiations between the parties.
I believe that the European Union should explicitly recognise the important progress achieved by the current government in strengthening its relationship with the EU.
On Monday 25 October, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to issue its conclusions on Moldova.
They should express support for the pro-European steps that have so far been taken by the current government, and most importantly, they could ask the Commission to work out an action plan as regards visa liberalisation.
This is an important issue for the citizens of Moldova.
Of course, the ultimate outcome will depend primarily on the election results.
As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I believe our attitude towards Moldova should be more positive.
We should demonstrate more clearly our support of the country's pro-European forces and show them that we care about Moldova becoming a future member of a united European family.
We should convince them that such a future is also in their best interest.
Mr President, Moldova has come a long way since the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact divided Europe into spheres of influence and Moldova became part of the USSR.
Moldova today is an independent state.
It is true that it has many problems.
At the same time, it is a democratic country on the way to European integration, so today I would like to encourage all political classes in that country, all the democratic political forces and all the ethnic communities to avoid unnecessary confrontations and concentrate on developing a broad vision for the Republic of Moldova with the aim of directing the country towards achieving its European goals.
Last but not least, there is Transnistria.
Transnistria should be high on our agenda and I welcome the initiative by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and by the political leaders of some other countries to resolve this frozen conflict.
Mr President, Moldova is the last piece of 'Latinity' outside the EU.
History has played a big role in that.
However, through the neighbourhood policy and Eastern Partnership, Moldova's prospects of first getting closer, and then being admitted, to the EU after fulfilling the required conditions are improving.
The current coalition, although facing an election soon, has accelerated the pace of reforms, to which the EU has responded properly.
Those in charge on both sides should be congratulated.
Both the pace of internal reform and the EU response should continue to get beyond the point of no return sooner, rather than later.
Moldova's chances depend, of course, on the solution to the Transnistrian conflict.
In that respect, we are encouraged by the current discussions on this topic announced in Potsdam at the German-Russian summit and, supposedly, evoked at the recent trilateral summit in Deauville, capitalising on the apparent willingness of Russia to find a solution.
Let us all keep faith and work together to bring this last piece of Latinity into the EU.
(DE) Mr President, when we have considered the Balkans in the past, for example, when we focused on the problems of Kosovo or Bosnia, we have tended to overlook Moldova.
The EU should long ago have taken on the role of mediator in the conflicts involving Moldova and its neighbours.
It is regrettable that Moldova has now rejected the EU's offer of mediation in the Transnistrian conflict.
It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family.
This is due to the country's chaotic, post-socialist economy.
As we know, the prime industrial area in the east of Moldova has declared its independence with the support of Russia and, by doing so, has put the seal on the country's economic decline, because the economy is based solely on agriculture.
When the citizens of Moldova go to the polls at the end of November to elect a new government, it will be important to ensure that the elections run smoothly, in order to prevent further unrest and an intensification of the conflict with Romania, for example.
(PL) Commissioner, I had the opportunity to observe the re-elections in Moldova.
When we talked to the representatives of the then opposition parties, we saw great desire for change.
That change has taken place.
The current prime minister, Mr Filat, speaking at the time as a representative of the opposition, clearly declared European aspirations.
We spoke with great approval of the effects of his work when he was a guest here in the European Parliament.
This has been confirmed, too, by the delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which visited Moldova recently.
The internal problems, in particular over Transnistria, and the breakup and disruption of the country, which are a symbol of the past and of division, are all very difficult issues.
We must support the process which will allow the incorporation of Transnistria into Moldova.
A number of problems exist there, including that of migration.
Commissioner, every expression of support for Moldova, and here I agree with my fellow Member Mr ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(IT) Mr President, last weekend I travelled to Chişinău, in Moldova.
I attended a convention, organised by the Minister for Culture, on Moldava's integration into Europe with particular reference to culture.
I very much appreciated the great desire for growth, especially through a series of initiatives ranging from the construction of infrastructure and of road, electricity and every other kind of networks, to vocational training for all trades and refresher courses for other professions.
The people of Moldova are very interested in joining Europe.
The government is aiming in the near future for actual integration into the European Union and is working along these lines.
It is fine for Europe to focus at the moment on ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, the number of natural recipients of EU funding is currently just under half the total membership.
As we extend membership to more and more and even poorer eastern states, the proportion of net recipients will increase to perhaps two-thirds.
This will self-evidently be at the expense of current net contributors, but it will also be at the expense of current members that are net recipients.
Easing visa restrictions, we are often told, has nothing to do with migration, by which they mean, of course, legal migration.
It will have everything to do with illegal migration: the trafficking of people to work for less than the minimum wage and less than minimum working conditions.
It will also deplete that country of people of working age who might bring the country out of poverty.
Lastly, I would say that Moldova declared its independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union.
Does it really wish to surrender its independence to the EU, however much it might receive in pieces of silver?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I very much appreciated this debate.
I appreciate the timing of this debate and most of all I appreciate the overall clear unity of the message and support of this distinguished House.
The Republic of Moldova is at a turning point in its history.
The Commission has been active in helping the Moldovan Government achieve as much as it can of its ambitious reform programme over the last year.
The reforms that we support reflect without any exception the broad range of objectives of the EU-Moldova action plan.
The success of these reforms is crucial for the future of the Republic of Moldova.
We have expressed our support of the vision of a modern and prosperous Moldova with a society reconciled and its territorial integrity restored on many occasions, and not just on 30 September when the so-called Group of Friends referred to by Mr Watson visited http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u" .
There is no doubt that Europe's history has a lesson to offer here.
The Republic of Moldova is on a positive trajectory.
I am confident that the country will be able to reach the political compromise necessary to sustain the commitment to reforms.
For our part, and as far as possible, we will all continue to stand by Moldova's citizens and provide the necessary external support to reforms.
We will continue to support them to successfully pass sustainability tests through the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
I too sincerely hope that after these elections we will see an inclusive political process in Moldova centred on a pro-European agenda, continuing with the transformation process to the benefit of Moldovan citizens and of Europe too.
To conclude this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Thursday 21 October 2010, at 12.00.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I too welcome the progress which the European Union has made during the last year in relation to the Republic of Moldova.
Allow me to congratulate my fellow Members who tabled this motion for a resolution.
Romania has been committed, since the time of its accession, to championing the Republic of Moldova's cause within the EU.
I believe that concrete proof of this initial commitment is demonstrated by the number of Romanian MEPs from various political groups who signed the resolution.
The EUR 90 million granted to this country in macro-financial assistance was and still is the lifeline which Moldova and its citizens needed to make progress and, in particular, to meet the commitments it has made in the area of reforms, the rule of law and the fight against corruption.
The Republic of Moldova has two major problems which have to be resolved.
The first one is Transnistria, where European governments have to make a more specific and firmer contribution and negotiations need to be resumed.
The second problem, which obviously depends on the democratic political forces in the Republic of Moldova which we need to encourage, is the way in which the elections will be conducted on 28 November.
We must guarantee citizens both inside and outside de facto access to the right to vote for their central government.
Thank you.

Extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to beneficiaries of international protection (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Claude Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the extension of the scope of Directive 2003/109/EC to beneficiaries of international protection - C6-0196/2007 -.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I fear that as I get into the first paragraph of my speech, there will be only me, the PPE coordinator, and the Commissioner left in the Chamber.
I admire you for your stamina, Commissioner.
I should never take up my speaking time by doing this, but I could not help it.
Thanks to the PPE Group for being here too at this time of night.
Commissioner, you and the Council did a great job in rescuing this proposal, which now benefits those who should never have been excluded from the original Long-Term Residence Directive.
There was another opportunity to include them in 2008, and again unfortunately, through the failure to reach unanimity in the Council, this could not happen.
So it is a very happy day today that a proposal taken on by my predecessor as coordinator in my group, Martine Roure, is now the subject of an agreement.
I am very grateful to the Council, too.
I pointed out in the previous debate that it was not present but, if it were present here today, I would thank the Council too, because during the Belgian Presidency, we were able to make good progress.
I am very grateful for that.
The proposal will bring direct benefit to all beneficiaries of international protection who have been in the EU for more than five years but currently cannot become long-term residents.
It will finally bring to an end their differential treatment compared to other third-country nationals and will give them greater certainty about their situation in the EU.
The main issue for the negotiations boiled down to the calculation of the time period of legal residence to reach the five years.
We supported the Commission that the full duration of the procedure should be taken into account.
However, this was strongly opposed by the Council.
We were particularly concerned about this, because asylum procedures can take many years in some Member States.
The compromise we have reached in the negotiations is that at least half of the asylum procedure will be taken into account and, if a procedure takes more than 18 months, the whole procedure will then be taken into account.
I hesitate to go on to the issue of correlation tables but I am duty bound to say something about them - I would rather not.
I would nevertheless like to implore the institutions to reach a horizontal agreement on this issue.
I would particularly urge the Council to recognise the importance of correlation tables for overseeing the implementation of legislation.
We had a very difficult situation in which many of the dossiers considered of great importance by groups across this House could have been delayed because of this issue.
I am very happy also that the scope of the proposal includes both refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection.
It is vital to continue the trend towards aligning the standards of protection and the rights granted to both groups, as in the recasting of the Qualification Directive.
The agreement also contains many safeguards against refoulement.
Given that beneficiaries will now be allowed to move between Member States, it is important that the protection background of beneficiaries is never forgotten.
Therefore, Member States will have to include a comment in the long-term residence permit and will be obliged to consult the Member State that granted protection in cases of possible expulsion.
The proposal also takes into account the transfer of protection to another Member State under national arrangements.
The long-term residence permit needs to be modified accordingly in order to safeguard against refoulement.
We have also ensured that the principle of family unity is upheld in the event of expulsion to another Member State, but it is also clear that it should not be automatic in cases where it may not be in the best interest of family members to go with the expelled person.
The agreement we have reached on this is a signal of the new cooperation which can exist between the three institutions in the area of asylum and legal migration aided by the new framework in the Lisbon Treaty.
It shows that we can reach an agreement with Member States on a progressive piece of asylum-related legislation.
I again want to thank my shadow rapporteurs from across the groups, Ms Nedelcheva, Ms Wikström and other colleagues who helped make this what I would call a pleasurable trialogue - if that is not a contradiction in terms!
I should like to thank all concerned for making this a reality.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament rapporteur, Claude Moraes.
He has done a fantastic job together with his team of shadow rapporteurs.
Parliament, the Commission and the Council have really achieved an agreement.
The minister was also very helpful.
The compromise that we have reached is a well-balanced one and is in line with the 2007 proposal.
The extension of long-term residence status to beneficiaries of international protection will ensure a higher level of protection and legal certainty for refugees in Europe and will allow for better integration in our societies.
This is also the first building block of our asylum package - the first of six pieces of legislation - and is a first step towards our joint aim of achieving a common European asylum system by 2012.
It will give a strong political signal that we can agree, that we are willing to go down this difficult but necessary road and make progress, and that we can act reasonably and constructively on this.
I would really like to thank you for that.
Concerning the much talked about issue of correlation tables, the Commission made a declaration to the Council.
I would like to read it out, with your permission: 'The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt with the EU directive and communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation, in the interest of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency and to assist the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions.
'The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the 2007 COM proposal amending the Long-Term Residence Directive which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory.
'The Commission, in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of the Long-Term Residence proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with a relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice.
'However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent.
The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding, together with the European Parliament and the Council, an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue'.
I think we can agree on this.
It is important that this declaration is in the protocol and has been heard.
As I said in the earlier debate, the Commission is repeating this argument.
Nevertheless, on this particular report, it is very important that we have reached agreement.
Thank you all, again, for your contribution.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Moraes, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on the excellent work he has done and on the exemplary cooperation he has shown with the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council.
With this report, we have made a great step forward towards a harmonised European asylum system.
The agreement reached with the Council was necessary and I am very pleased that we have succeeded in making progress on this issue.
The asylum package is very much greater and, indeed, there is still much to be done.
Therefore, we must not drop our guard and I hope that the Council will take the same cooperative attitude in negotiations on future issues.
That is what I wanted to say by way of introduction.
Regarding the substance of the dossier, without repeating the rapporteur's words, I would like to go back to two points.
First of all, I would like to stress the importance of integrating third-country nationals into our societies.
Migrants who come to our countries are a considerable asset to our economies.
We cannot, however, welcome everybody under any conditions.
Several governments have realised in recent months that their integration model has failed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Moraes, who has drawn up the report on which we are to give our views to his usual high standard and with a sincere desire to uphold humanitarian principles and the principle of respect for our fellow human beings.
Beneficiaries of international protection in a Member State often stay there for a very long time, perhaps the rest of their lives, as their vulnerability and persecution in the country from which they have fled tends to remain for a very long time.
Many beneficiaries of international protection therefore find themselves in the same situation as those who are classed as refugees.
It is also reasonable for people to be classed as resident in a country after they have lived there for five years, and this was the approach taken by both the Commission and Parliament.
The Council wanted to take a different approach, which I find regrettable.
I would also like to emphasise that members of the family of the person who is a beneficiary of international protection must have the chance to shape their own lives.
For example, in the case of expulsion, the family must be allowed to choose whether to follow or to remain where they are.
I am pleased that Parliament will now adopt this report.
It is regrettable that the Council has not approved the correlation tables, but I welcome the fact that we are pressing on with the reports that are to be included in the common European asylum system.
It is to be hoped that the Council will now take more of a listening approach.
We all have the same deadline to meet and that is 2012.
We now need to relinquish our old, ingrained opinions and look to the pan-European approach and what is best for everyone when it comes to asylum and migration.
Otherwise, the word 'solidarity' will soon become meaningless.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, once again for his fine work and for his very good, if not excellent, cooperation on this report.
Mr President, last week, we visited Athens with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and while I was there, I talked to Mamuth.
Mamuth is 26 years old and comes from Eritrea.
He entered the European Union via Greece and travelled on to the Netherlands, where he would have preferred to stay, because he had some contacts there, but he was sent back to Greece.
Mamuth said that, when he eventually got his refugee status in Greece, he would not be able to travel freely and that it would take an eternity before he was granted Greek nationality.
It is for the sake of young men like Mamuth, who are entitled to a new life and do not deserve to be shunted back and forth across borders again, that I am pleased that this House is now going to change that situation and that rapporteur Claude Moraes has managed to take this first step in our asylum packages.
It is also important that Mamuth, who would actually prefer to live his new life in the Netherlands, is given a decent basis for comparison, because this young man has the right to see how various matters are dealt with in Greece and the Netherlands, or wherever it is that he wants to build his life.
Thank you, Mr Moraes, thank you for your cooperation and let us see how long the process takes for Mamuth.
(MT) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Claude Moraes on his report.
I agree with the report and welcome it with satisfaction because it will grant new rights to those who apply for international protection, including refugees.
It will furnish them with rights which, after all, are already given to third-country citizens that have been legally residing in a European Union country for five years.
There are, however, a few difficulties in this report.
I come from a country which has experienced these difficulties, namely that five years is far too long a time to wait in order to acquire the right that is granted by this law.
This applies especially to those countries who are hosting a huge amount of people who are stuck there; blocked in the country they first arrive at.
Aside from my country, there are others that have recently undergone similar experiences, Greece being one of them.
They are hosting vast numbers of persons who are required to wait five years to benefit from these rights, as laid down by this law.
Naturally, they ultimately benefit from long-term residence, yet they can also move to other European Union countries, which could be of great help to those like Greece, Malta, Cyprus and others.
Therefore, I believe that this law, although good, could have been improved upon by decreasing the stipulated five-year waiting period.
Here, I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur Claude Moraes for having recognised this and for having done what he could to insert a reference, albeit a symbolic one to him, in an explanatory note at the end.
(RO) Mr President, I, too, must begin by congratulating my colleague, Claude Moraes, for this report.
I also want to thank him for the exceptional efforts he makes as coordinator within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I think that it is excellent that this new directive finally fills a legal vacuum with regard to the right of residence which beneficiaries of international protection find themselves in throughout the European Union.
These persons who have settled in one of the Member States are currently in a precarious state of legal certainty due to the fact that they are not eligible, under current circumstances, for long-term residence permits, something other third-country nationals are eligible for.
They must be granted the right of long-term residence in a non-discriminatory manner, with the only condition being prior legal residence, as is also the case for the other third-country nationals.
I believe that it would have been better to take into account in this calculation the whole duration of legal residence within the European Union, from the time the application for international protection was lodged.
At the same time, consideration must be given to the fact that these people are permanently vulnerable outside the European Union, so that any move to withdraw international protection or the right to residence must be carried out with complete respect for their fundamental rights and the principle of non-refoulement.
This directive provides the necessary additional provisions with regard to the procedures that can be applied if it comes to expulsion or ending international protection.
I think that we must vote in support of Claude Moraes's report as it is part of the general package governing the European Union's asylum and migration system.
(DE) Mr President, I am not looking at this report through rose-tinted spectacles.
I am deliberately looking at it through the eyes of the citizens in our home countries who are concerned because after residing for five years in a Member State, refugees are then to be granted long-term resident status.
This will then apply throughout the territory of the EU.
So once a refugee has settled in a country with relatively soft asylum law, after five years he will be able to move his place of residence to any other Member State he chooses - and naturally he will initially seek out a country where the regulations have loopholes or are softer, and will subsequently settle long-term wherever the social standards are obviously high.
The consequence will be secondary migration and abuse.
Even the accumulation of a duration of five years in the asylum system is problematic, since often the administrative procedures are subject to wilful delays and investigations.
Extending the directive would place an even greater burden on those Member States with a high social standard, which already have huge problems in any case, making it harder still for refugees to be integrated.
I shall be extremely critical of this report.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I do not have much to add.
There is a big consensus of support here for the work done by Mr Moraes on this very important directive.
I would just once again make a pledge to Mr Moraes and the others that this is an important building block.
I believe it will get strong support tomorrow in the vote.
This is the first step in our common journey towards 2012 and the asylum package.
I just hope that this spirit of constructive cooperation will remain because I need - and I am counting on - your support for the remaining directives.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to formally thank the Commissioner again for her work on this.
One of the reasons why we hope that the first step on asylum can be completed in tomorrow's vote - and I hope it is a resounding vote - is because, although asylum remains one of the deeply sensitive issues for this House, as Mr Busuttil explained for smaller countries in particular, every piece of legislation on asylum can have a disproportionate effect, not just on small countries, but also on flashpoint countries such as Greece.
We should all proceed carefully, as we did in this report, and there are some items in the explanatory memorandum which ensure that Members' concerns are taken very seriously, particularly when they come from serious Members.
For example, I think we were able to incorporate Ms Nedelcheva's concerns regarding integration and those of Ms Wikström when she talked about family members and expulsion, as well as the issues of domestic violence and other issues.
It is when we have that kind of cooperation that negotiations go very well at the higher level of the Commission and the Council thanks to the work we do in Parliament with colleagues.
Finally, Ms Sargentini, I really wanted to find an inventive way of saying that correlation tables were extremely important.
To say that asylum seekers are now waiting for the correlation tables to be implemented is probably the most inventive and imaginative lobbying for the correlation table resolution to happen, so I hope Council was listening.
Thank you again to all my colleagues for their support on this report after such a long time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 14 December 2010.
Documents received: see Minutes
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Question Time (B7-0001/2011).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Utilisation of European funds
According to a recent article in the Financial Times, the European Union has only spent 10% of the EUR 347 billion allocated for the period up to 2013 to promote the development of poor regions.
That article also states that funding earmarked for SMEs has come to be used by multinational companies (Coca-Cola, IBM, Nokia Siemens) while other large companies (Twining, Valeo) are using EU funds to transfer their operations to countries where labour is cheaper, thereby violating rules explicitly prohibiting that practice.
What is the Commission's view of the information contained in that article, and what steps is it considering taking to prevent such situations arising in the future?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Financial Times's scrutiny as it represents an important contribution to opening and broadening public debate about the efficiency and effectiveness of cohesion policy.
The Commission is aware of the habitually slower take-up at the beginning of a programming period.
However, the most recent data show that the Commission made more cohesion policy payments in the fourth quarter of 2010 than ever before.
The vast majority of the payments made were interim payments, i.e. reimbursements of expenditure already made and certified in the Member States.
Thus, it is certain that, as has been seen in previous programming periods, cohesion policy spending is accelerating.
Absorption rates, in terms of EU payments to Member States, are now at 21% for the Cohesion Fund, 22% for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and 23% for the European Social Fund (ESF).
As regards support provided to multinational and large companies, the Commission would emphasise that a primary objective of cohesion policy is growth and the creation of new jobs for particular regions and Member States.
Any support for productive investment has to be seen in that context.
Promoting job creation and economic growth can be achieved in many ways, from setting up small enterprises to supporting larger companies.
Cohesion policy intervention supports productive investment that is primarily targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises, as specified by the ERDF and ESF regulations.
The Commission also stressed the role of small and medium-sized enterprises during negotiation of the current programming documents.
The vast majority of productive investment and investment in the development of endogenous potential is targeted at SMEs.
However, there may be cases where, in line with the regulations, cofinancing is granted to larger companies subject to compliance with the objectives of the funds and programmes concerned.
In total, cohesion policy has allocated some EUR 55 billion to business support between 2007 and 2013, a large share of which supports innovation in SMEs.
The Commission would like to point out that multinationals are not beneficiaries of the support extended by the ESF.
Workers receive the cofinanced training.
The ESF supports people.
It is about providing training and retraining and improving skills to prepare people and help them find a job.
A worker who has been employed in a given enterprise may well then find himself or herself engaged in another company.
Therefore, what matters is the skill capital that workers manage to build to sustain their inclusion in the labour market, not the name or type of enterprises providing the training.
The Commission considers that, from a policy perspective, firms should not receive European funding for investments which would lead to the loss of employment by the same company in another region of the European Union, because the net effect of the ESF investment might be zero or even negative.
In cases where a company which has received cohesion policy support closes down, or ceases to support a project, within five years - or three years in the case of SMEs - this funding needs to be paid back.
My final point - but it is a crucial one - is that while there are clearly areas for improvement, this cannot and should not overshadow the major positive impact that cohesion policy is having.
I would like to assure you that the Commission is not shying away from the problems.
Indeed, in the past, we have proposed changes, some of which were taken up, and we will continue to drive improvement of cohesion policy.
Cohesion policy brings clear benefits to the poorer regions of the European Union, but it also clearly benefits the rest of Europe.
(RO) I wish to thank the Commissioner as well for the quality of the information provided.
However, I would like to make a further comment.
In a debate like this, when we are dealing with such a topic, I believe that we should focus rather on the future measures intended to ensure that we avoid similar situations and, if you permit me to say so, it may even be more important for us to ask ourselves the question whether such figures, once they have come to public attention, are not somehow likely to reduce citizens' trust in the work of the EU institutions.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would particularly like to thank you for the clarification, since that provides a basis for a sensible discussion as well as a clear commitment to our small and medium-sized enterprises.
After all, they provide two-thirds of Europe's jobs and pay 80% of taxes.
My question is therefore whether you believe that in future, we can strengthen the research framework conditions and the research infrastructure somewhat more.
(LT) Mr President, I have the following question.
Money from the Structural Funds and, in particular, money from the European Social Fund is very important.
It is aimed at enhancing workers' qualifications and preserving jobs so that these are filled by qualified people.
However, do you believe that equal conditions exist for wealthy international corporations, because they have to make a contribution of their own in order to obtain money from the Structural Funds or the European Social Fund, and small and medium-sized enterprises, which also want to train their people and want to have qualified employees?
Do you not envisage some sort of proposals here, given that large corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises do not enjoy equal conditions?
Mr President, thank you for your questions.
Where research infrastructure is concerned, small and medium-sized enterprises already receive considerable resources from the European Regional Development Fund, particularly in the area of encouraging innovation - where they receive innovation subsidies into the high tens of billions of euro.
In the period 2000-2006, more than 30 000 enterprises in total concentrated on this area in a focused manner.
We are giving consideration to the fact that substantial importance should also be attached to the research infrastructure, particularly in the future - not just in the area of the economy, but also in the area of basic research.
It is possible that even in the current period we will subsidise a research infrastructure project that is also included in the ESFRI - the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures - Road map with such funds for the first time, because investigations into this project have revealed that it has a very sustained impact in a region beyond that of the project itself in that jobs will be created, not just research jobs, but also jobs in enterprises that supply these, since even basic research infrastructure needs services and supplies.
In other words, it could be a real hub in a particular area in a region - in this case, a region of Hungary.
That should also send out a signal for the coming programming period, perhaps to universities, which, in the final event, also have concrete effects.
Already today, nearly a third of university research activities are in the area of applied research, which, in the end, benefits the economy and creates lasting jobs.
If I may turn to the honourable lady's question, within the framework of the European Social Fund, it is generally employed or temporarily unemployed workers who receive assistance with training, in order to put them in a position in which their prospects on the jobs market are improved.
This may be within the enterprise in which they are employed or, if they are not employed, it may be in order to improve their skills or simply to make them better qualified generally for other possible types of employment.
I can give you an example - because perhaps that is what you were hinting at and because it has come in for a lot of criticism - and that is that McDonald's workers, for example, have been offered further training.
A clear distinction must be made here: these were further training measures for McDonald's workers in order to make them better qualified on the jobs market and in the world of work.
As you know - it has, after all, been somewhat criticised - jobs at McDonald's, often nicknamed 'McJobs', are generally part-time jobs that may require no great qualifications; jobs that are often done by students.
It is a matter of upskilling these people.
Where in-house further qualification is concerned, such as in this project, McDonald's - to take an example - bore all the costs itself.
In other words, we are trying and endeavouring to ensure that the further training that workers receive concentrates on their own personal qualifications.
In view of this, I believe that it should make no difference where these people are employed; rather, our objective must be to improve further the quality of each person's skills in order to make people more fit for an increasingly mobile labour market, thereby avoiding unemployment wherever possible.
Subject: European Progress Microfinance Facility
Implementation of the European Progress Microfinance Facility (EPMF) seems to be slower than expected, a situation which could endanger its purpose and which is manifestly at odds with the speed of its adoption in March 2010.
How does the Commission intend to speed up the process and make sure that the EPMF reaches the most vulnerable people while also reflecting the right geographical balance?
What does the Commission plan to do in order to get the Member States to finance mentoring and training programmes, and also to ensure that interest payments are subsidised from European Social Fund resources, as agreed?
How will the Commission ensure that information about the EPMF reaches the target audiences?
Member of the Commission. - Dear colleagues, I am pleased to report that both parts of the European Progress Microfinance Facility - the guarantees part and the cash products part - are now entirely operational.
Only three months after the entry into force of the decision, the Commission finalised the mandate for the European Investment Fund to launch the guarantee operations for microfinance providers.
Last November, the Commission established a specialised investment vehicle.
As a result, the first micro-loans will be provided starting from this month.
I am also pleased to report that the Commission has been successful in securing additional funding for micro-entrepreneurs in Europe.
The European Investment Bank will match the European Union's contribution of EUR 100 million, and further contributors are expected.
As a result, the overall volume of loans under the Progress Microfinance Facility will amount, as planned, to around EUR 500 million.
This money will benefit unemployed people, people facing social exclusion or vulnerable persons who face difficulties in accessing the conventional credit market.
Ensuring outreach to these target groups and promoting geographical balance are key elements of the mandate given by the Commission to the European Investment Fund.
Operations approved so far, or under preparation, suggest that both objectives will be met.
As from early 2011, micro-loans will be provided through a start-up microfinancing institution in Belgium which focuses on disadvantaged urban communities, and through a foundation in the Netherlands which targets individuals with no access to conventional finance.
The EIF has announced that the operations being prepared will also be balanced in terms of geographical coverage.
About 40% are expected to involve intermediaries investing in Europe and about 60% in Central and Eastern Europe.
It is well known that microfinance is most effective if business starters and micro-enterprises are accompanied through business support services.
As such, the Commission will undertake measures to support European Social Fund managing authorities and intermediate bodies to step up the promotion of self-employment and micro-enterprises.
For the current ESF programming period, the Member States have earmarked more than EUR 2.7 billion to promote entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs can also be supported through interest rebates.
However, whether or not interest rebates are subsidised through the ESF is a decision to be taken by the individual Member States.
At present, only one Member State, namely Lithuania, has indicated that it makes use of this possibility.
Lastly, the Commission will promote information about the Progress Microfinance Facility.
The microfinance providers who are closest to the target beneficiaries will provide information on the availability of micro-loans.
The Commission will make use of existing networks of public employment services, ESF managing authorities and NGOs, to provide information on the progress of the Microfinance Facility.
Last but not least, the Youth on the Move campaign will pay special attention to opportunities for young people from different backgrounds to start up their own businesses and receive micro-loans.
(HU) Mr President, I was pleased to hear the Commissioner's report and would like to clarify one part.
When we received the report from the Commission and the European Investment Fund a few weeks ago, it talked about a total sum in the region of only EUR 200 million.
One of my questions was exactly this, that the original promise or plan envisaged EUR 500 million.
I am interested where these additional funds came from.
I believe this is very important, as this is a high priority programme for the mitigation of the effects of the crisis, which is partly why we hurried with its adoption.
The other important question was whether Member States support interest payment subsidies and training and mentoring elements from the Social Fund.
This also featured in the original plan, and then the Commission seemed to neglect this issue.
Supplying information, ensuring that information reaches people, is very important.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for this information.
I fully agree with you that the instrument which we have discussed today is a very important one.
However, it is worth mentioning that we should also answer the question as to which states are using the Microfinance Facility.
I was concerned that you stated in your reply that we should ensure different levels of distribution by state and geographical area.
Have any states used the instrument as yet?
(RO) Mr President, young people are admittedly hit hardest by the economic and financial crisis, but we must not forget either people over the age of 45 who are unemployed.
I would like to ask you the following question, because you mentioned that 60% of the European Progress Microfinance Facility will go towards Central and Eastern Europe: have you identified the barriers which have prevented the countries in this region of Europe from making sufficient use of this instrument up until now?
Thank you very much for your interest and your comments.
The subject of microfinance is, in fact, one covered by a number of directorates general, with Mr Andor taking a certain lead as regards substance.
However, it is also something that we are concerned with within the area of regional policy.
Where interest rates are concerned, there are some Member States that have set a cap - as a condition, so to speak - which is at around 8 to 9.5 per cent.
What must also be taken into account here, however, is that naturally - and this has always been a matter for discussion, including during the preparations for all this - the overheads are relatively high in relation to the actual loans, and therefore, costs are incurred which need to be covered.
A sensible middle way has to be found, and I think we have succeeded in this.
Moving on to the second question, I can tell you that the Jasmine instrument - which is intended to assist with the appropriate preparations for microfinance and to pave the way for intermediaries to be set up and trained - is currently being used to make ready 15 institutions in 15 different countries, 11 of them in Central and Eastern Europe and four in Western Europe.
I cannot tell you all the countries off the top of my head, but essentially, they are mostly the new accession countries, and we expect that in the coming years, a further 20 intermediaries will be prepared accordingly by the Jasmine programme.
Regarding the last question, I must ask you to bear with me since I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer.
We will forward an answer in writing, stating in detail the reasons for restricting access.
I would certainly assume, however, that there are often communication problems here and that there are also often obstacles because many of the potential borrowers are people who can no longer obtain loans from a 'conventional' bank and there is therefore often also a certain amount of anxiety or reticence when it comes to approaching such facilities.
If this is the case and it becomes ingrained and established, however, then it will be necessary to carry out information activities in this area as appropriate.
Subject: Additional support measures for SMEs under tourism policy
Tourism, like any other sector of the economy, is increasingly feeling the effects of world competition.
In order for the European Union to remain competitive in this sector, the EU has set itself the objective in the Lisbon Treaty of promoting the competitiveness of tourism and creating an environment favourable to business development.
For this purpose, the following objectives have been adopted: promoting innovation in tourism, improving the overall quality of tourism services and perfecting the professional skills of personnel.
However, businesses in the tourism sector - many of which are SMEs - are not always able to attain these objectives through their own unaided efforts.
This is due to several factors, such as limited financial resources, the lack of qualified workers and inability to respond quickly to change: hence the need for additional funding.
Does not the Commission consider that it would be desirable to devise a coherent strategy and a detailed action plan comprising specific support measures for SMEs and financing arrangements which could help to overcome the difficulties encountered by the sector?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European tourism industry, like many other economic sectors, has to face the ever greater challenge of globalisation.
This is a challenge that the Commission has already emphasised and addressed on many occasions, in particular, with the communication 'An industrial policy for the globalisation era'.
Furthermore, on 30 June last year, the Commission adopted a specific communication on tourism, which proposes - in line with the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Europe 2020 strategy - a consolidated political framework to strengthen competitiveness in the sector, with the aim of making European tourism a truly competitive, modern, sustainable and responsible industry.
The creation of an environment that is conducive to the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector is the principle on which this consolidated framework is based.
To achieve this objective, we proposed three specific measures aimed, firstly, at stimulating competitiveness in the European tourism sector; secondly, at promoting the development of sustainable, responsible and high quality tourism; and thirdly, at consolidating the image and profile of Europe as a collection of sustainable and high quality tourist destinations and, of course, maximising the potential of EU financial policies and instruments for developing tourism.
The initiatives promoted should provide the sector with the instruments necessary to adapt to the challenges faced by its operators, and to work towards its sustainable development in terms of competitiveness.
Of course, specific measures will be taken to promote innovation in the tourism sector, reinforce the quality of tourism services and improve the professional skills of tourism workers, because we must no longer regard tourism as a sector consisting exclusively of family businesses; we must also consider how we can make it more modern and more competitive.
I will give a few examples regarding training and professional skills: an 'ICT and tourism' platform will be launched to facilitate the adaptation of the tourism sector and its businesses to developments in the new information technologies market and improve their competitiveness.
All of these proposals and ideas are contained in the Commission communication, which has been approved by the Council and which we are debating in Parliament - the rapporteur is present in the Chamber.
The industry's operators will be encouraged to make better use of the Union's various programmes, such as Leonardo, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, Erasmus for young entrepreneurs, the European Social Fund and other programmes.
Furthermore, a strategy to promote the diversification of tourist services and the creation of a virtual electronic observatory for European tourism will likewise help to create a favourable environment for the sector's operators.
In addition, I must point out that small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from other cross-cutting initiatives to access funding.
I would mention JEREMIE, the joint initiative of the Commission, the European Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank, which is aimed at improving access to funding for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, through the channels of risk capital, loans, securities, micro-credit and other forms of repayable aid.
Lastly, I would point out that small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector are fully covered by the measures proposed in the framework of the Small Business Act, which is intended to promote the business environment of those very same enterprises.
Parliament will receive the updated text in a few weeks' time.
Hence, the Small Business Act will also become an instrument for safeguarding small and medium-sized enterprises, which offer huge potential in terms of the development of a sector that I hope to be able to strengthen over the next year, because I am absolutely convinced that a European policy, as laid down in the Treaty, can bring added value to the excellent work that is already being done by Europe's regions and the Member States.
I therefore feel able to reassure the honourable Member who tabled the question that the Commission and I are committed to ensuring that all small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector are supported and assisted in their efforts to access EU economic instruments, as part of a political strategy aimed at making tourism one of our key economic and industrial policy sectors.
(LT) Mr President, probably all of us here today in Parliament hope that the forecast you gave on the development of tourism in the future will indeed become a reality, and this area will not only be developed, but will be favourable for investment.
As you know, tourism is, to date, still unevenly developed in the European Union, and there are objective and subjective reasons for this.
I have a question.
In the Baltic Sea strategy, the attractiveness and accessibility of the Baltic region is listed as one of the main objectives.
What exactly has been achieved in this area over the year?
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Balčytis for this question, which places at the heart of our debate issues that Parliament will have an opportunity to address again in the coming months, with the parliamentary report for which I am responsible.
First and foremost, we must give Vice-President Tajani credit for having given a very strong boost to the new European tourism policy laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon, with the communication adopted last June and the associated implementation plan presented a few weeks ago.
These two acts are focused specifically on small and medium-sized enterprises and on competitiveness in the sector, with particular reference to innovation and training-related issues.
With regard to funding, we must act on two fronts: firstly, we must raise awareness of the funds that already exist and ensure that greater use is made of them and, secondly, Parliament must campaign strongly for - I am finishing here, Mr President - the inclusion of specific budget headings for tourism policies in the financial perspective 2014-2020.
(RO) There are some countries which use, for instance, the regional Competitiveness and Innovation Programme or the Operational Programme to develop tourism and, in the case of the United Kingdom or Greece, the Operational Programme for Regional Development.
I would like to ask you whether you intend to create a European framework to increase SMEs' participation in accessing European funds for developing tourism.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Balčytis since he has given me an opportunity to speak on an issue that, of all the issues for which I am responsible as European Commissioner, is particularly close to my heart, and as the first European Commissioner for Tourism, I believe that tourism policy, together with industrial policy and space policy, is a priority.
To give a concrete answer, however, the central issue, aside from the policy initiatives that I have tried to implement since becoming Commissioner, is the one that Mr Fidanza raised in his speech: since the EU was not responsible for tourism policy prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the current financial perspective does not include the funds necessary for the EU to contribute to a strong tourism effort.
We have interesting programmes such as Calypso, which, in Spain, have been enhanced by what are, in my view, some very positive regional initiatives.
However, while I clearly understood the point made by Mr Fidanza in the report that Parliament is due to submit, there will be support, because the funds earmarked for tourism policy will be increased in the next financial perspective.
They may be increased in the eighth framework programme, or through the introduction of ad hoc budget lines.
The important thing, however, is that Parliament brings the problem to light, because it is difficult to give concrete answers if the economic instruments are not in place.
Nevertheless, that does not mean that we will not act with great determination.
As you know, countless initiatives have been taken, the Belgian Presidency organised a major event in Malta, and the Hungarian Presidency has already announced that it will organise a major event specifically devoted to tourism - this was the topic of our first meeting, which was held in Budapest a few days ago.
I am glad that Mr Balčytis raised the issue of tourism in the Baltic region: tourism is not an issue that exclusively concerns the economies of Mediterranean countries - Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Malta.
It is an extremely important resource for the whole of the European Union, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which have their own sights and their own potential to be developed.
On the subject of the Baltic States, I believe that one of the issues - which, incidentally, is addressed in the text that was approved on 30 June last year - is the relationship with the new emerging classes, with the new middle class in Russia.
Millions upon millions of Russians plan to carry out tourist activities and, hence, wish to travel outside their country.
We have a problem with regard to visas.
The same problem exists with regard to China, I believe. The European Commission and the tourism ministers are determined to try to resolve this problem regarding potential visitors from both Russia and China.
We want to speed matters up and make it easier for them to be admitted into our countries.
Moreover, the Baltic States, being closer to Russia, can reap the potential economic benefits of hosting tourists from the emerging middle class, too.
This is at the very heart of our work to promote tourism policies, and I am also encouraged by the fact that many ministers from the various Member States, including the United Kingdom - I met the UK's new tourism minister a few weeks ago in London - and France, are firmly committed to supporting EU tourism policy.
It is important to identify a number of gateways, because Europe must represent added value.
I am delighted that Commissioner Vassiliou has sought to include in the text on sport that was adopted today the point that major sporting events, such as the forthcoming London Olympics, are a great opportunity for the whole of the European Union.
In short, we must ensure that every country in the EU can act as a gateway for tourists to enter and visit that country, but then to go and visit other European countries once they have finished.
This is the additional action the European Commission can take, and Parliament's support is crucial as far as I am concerned.
May I thank you now for your future efforts, including in the debate on tourism policy, but also in all the debates concerning the forthcoming budget activities.
Part two
Subject: Programmes and initiatives to modernise higher education
Studies have been carried out in some Member States in order to determine how higher education institutions have adapted to the new labour market requirements and what prospects graduates have of finding work once they have completed their degree course.
The research has shown - regrettably - that many universities are preparing specialists for a market that is already saturated.
College syllabuses do not always allow for the needs of the labour market, and those who suffer most as a result are, therefore, new graduates.
The Commission's work programme for 2011 refers to the modernisation of higher education and states that proposals might be put forward on the systems to be applied in order to assess, and bring transparency to, the activities of higher education institutions.
That being the case, what specific programmes and model initiatives will the Commission adopt with a view to modernising higher education in Europe?
Will it draw up a special strategy to modernise higher education so as to ensure that young graduates will be able to find a job as quickly as possible?
How much is it willing to invest in the future in programmes and initiatives of this kind for young people?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, education is one of the major factors that determines employability.
The risk of being unemployed is 40% lower for higher education graduates than for people with only secondary education.
However, youth unemployment and under-employment are unacceptably high today.
Too many graduates struggle to make the transition to the labour market and secure quality employment that corresponds to their educational background.
Of course, the efforts to improve employability begin well before higher education.
The Commission works with Member States to identify the skills or key competences that young people need to learn at school.
Today, young people need a wider range of skills than ever before in order to flourish in a globalised economy.
Many will work in jobs that do not yet exist.
Many will need advanced linguistic, intercultural and entrepreneurial skills.
Technology will continue to change the world in ways we cannot imagine, so the ability to continue to learn and to innovate will become crucial factors for employability.
Guidance is also critical.
Young people are confronted with an increased number of educational choices.
They need to be able to take informed decisions.
This requires better information about education and training paths, including a clear picture of job opportunities.
We need to develop quality career guidance services and vocational orientation with the strong involvement of labour market institutions.
Turning to higher education, the Commission recently launched, as you know, Youth on the Move - a Europe 2020 flagship initiative which sets out to make education and training more relevant to young people's needs.
We are now starting to implement the various parts of this strategy.
Later this year, the Commission plans to present a new Communication on the modernisation of higher education.
We will take stock of progress in making higher education more relevant to the needs of the knowledge-based society, including the question of employability.
We will identify the key challenges for the future and set out our response.
As part of these efforts, the Commission will reinforce the European platform for dialogue between universities and business, with a view to increasing the employability of students and to developing the role of education in the knowledge triangle.
In a more global and mobile world, transparency regarding the performance of higher education institutions can stimulate both competition and cooperation, and be an incentive for further improvements and modernisation.
However, existing international rankings can give an incomplete picture of the performance of universities.
This year, the Commission will present the results of a feasibility study to develop an alternative multi-dimensional ranking system which reflects the diversity of higher education institutions.
Europe needs to be better at anticipating the skill needs of tomorrow.
This is why the Commission has launched the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, which goes hand in hand with our Youth on the Move initiative.
The Agenda for New Skills and Jobs looks at how to help our young people to become more employable.
Above all, we need to give people the right mix of skills so that they can adapt to our fast-changing society.
Our new EU Skills Panorama, which will be operational in 2012, will help to forecast not only the skills that employers need today, but also those required in the future.
In the spring of this year, the Commission intends to propose new European benchmarks on learning mobility and on the role of education in preparing people to be employable in the knowledge-based labour market.
Finally, EU programmes to support education, training and youth, including mobility programmes such as Erasmus, can help young people to improve their chances in the labour market by gaining valuable international experience and by developing their intellectual understanding.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your really comprehensive response.
However, I would like to pose an additional question.
The European Union must guarantee all citizens the right to quality higher education.
However, in the Member States, there are many differences between higher education systems, the costs of higher education and the provision of loans to pay for studies.
High interest on loans taken out to pay for studies and unfavourable loan repayment conditions often deter young people from pursuing higher education in their own country and encourage a brain drain to other countries.
Does the European Commission intend to publish guidance on preferred conditions for the provision of student loans?
(PL) Mr President, I would like to ask just one question, although we could discuss various matters at this juncture.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether any work is being done on increasing funds for student exchange programmes in Europe.
I have the impression that the funding pool which we have for Erasmus and other programmes has remained the same for several years.
Currently, these awards are certainly very low.
(EL) Commissioner, it is true that this particular issue comes within the scope of subsidiarity.
However, the Member States are financed by the European Union with funds to modernise syllabuses in the Member States.
For example, under the previous, the third, Community Support Framework, numerous Member States took up Community funds for that purpose.
I have a very specific question: does the Commission have data on the efficacy of the funds which were given and which will be given to the Member States?
Member of the Commission. - First of all, on the question of the disparities between higher education institutes: exactly!
That is why we want to have transparency in the records of universities.
That is why we are now completing the feasibility study on the basis of which we shall dare to look into the ranking of universities, the mapping of universities and the standards of universities in order to give students more informed choices.
The aim is for them to know exactly where to study, what to study and what is the standard of the university that they want to enter.
Regarding fees, I think I agree with you that high fees need fair loans, but as I am sure you know, this is the responsibility of the Member States.
We know that one thing that economists agree on is that investment in education is something which will produce long-term results, growth and jobs, so I always urge governments not to cut university investment or education investment in general.
Moreover, I agree with the honourable Member who raised the question of the insufficiency of mobility grants like Erasmus.
That is why we are again completing a feasibility study - a study by the London School of Economics, which I hope will be ready in a couple of months - on the basis of which we shall explore, with the European Investment Bank, the possibility of creating a European student loan for mobility.
This, I am sure, will give all students, whether they are poor or rich, the possibility of taking advantage of these excellent mobility grants.
With regard to Mr Papanikolaou's question, he is talking about the structural development funds on the basis of which governments can build their education infrastructure.
Unfortunately, the Structural Funds are not my responsibility, but I will find out from Commissioner Hahn whether there are any reports by Member States as to the outcome of these grants and if so, I will certainly let you know.
Subject: Performance of pupils in EU Member States
On the whole, the recently published results of the international survey of the performance of 15-year-old school pupils (PISA Survey 2009) show that the EU's competitiveness is seriously threatened, because in the field of reading competence (Levels 5-6), only two EU countries are ranked in the top 10.
In the field of mathematics, only three EU countries figure in the top 10, and none are in the top five.
In 2020, both these young people and their younger fellow pupils will either be active on the labour market or be in the process of entering it, and it is therefore necessary to take immediate effective measures in the Member States if we wish to significantly improve the quality of pupils' education.
Will the Commission make a thorough assessment of the above survey and submit specific recommendations to the Member States for procedures of proven effectiveness?
Are there plans for compiling a programme to disseminate such tried and tested procedures or to establish a forum to debate the challenges which need to be faced?
Should discussions be held with the Member States to determine what measures need to be taken in order to improve their results?
Member of the Commission. - As you are aware, it is for each Member State to decide how to organise its educational system.
This is in accordance with Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Nevertheless, the Commission works with Member States to foster mutual learning and exchanges of good practice.
As we stated in the Europe 2020 strategy, it is vital for Europe's future as a knowledge-based and inclusive society that education systems are reformed and modernised to match the best in the world.
The OECD's PISA survey is an important resource for these exchanges.
The latest PISA survey, published in December 2010, shows a mixed picture for EU Member States.
There are signs of considerable improvement in some systems but, overall, there is much progress still to be made.
These results will provide an important input to future exchanges between the Commission and the Member States.
The European benchmark, adopted by the Council in May 2009, aims at an adequate level of basic skills in reading, mathematics and science by calling for the share of low achievers aged 15 to be reduced to below 15% by the year 2020.
Now I would like to read something from the PISA report, which is very relevant.
The share of low achieving pupils in reading, which had increased from 21% in 2000 to 24% in 2006, improved to 20% in 2009.
Nevertheless, the OECD 2010 benchmark of reducing the 2000 share by 20% to reach 17% was not reached.
The share of low achieving pupils in maths and science has been declining since 2006.
There was more progress in science than in maths and the share of low achievers is today lower in science than in maths.
If 2006 is used as a strong starting point, the EU is well on track as regards progress towards the 2020 low achiever benchmark.
On average, over the three disciplines in the 25 EU countries for which data is available, 22.5% were low achievers in 2006 and, by 2009, their share had declined to 19.6%.
So we see that, on average, in the European Union we have made progress.
The Commission will, of course, analyse the PISA results and publish its conclusions in its next annual progress report on benchmarks in 2011.
In November 2010, the Council invited the Commission and Member States to focus their joint work on the following areas: curriculum design, motivation for reading, literacy, maths, science and technology, the impact of new technologies on basic skills and their use in helping learners to acquire autonomy and maintain motivation, gender differences in performance and attitudes, the link between pupils' background and their mastery of basic skills and, finally, issues around teachers and teacher trainers as well as around schools' ethos and characteristics.
In its conclusion, the Council also invited the Commission to establish a high-level group on literacy and a thematic working group on maths, science and technology.
I intend to launch the high-level group on literacy on 1 February.
It will suggest policy measures based on best practices and research, which will help Member States to improve the consistency and effectiveness of the provision of basic skills within their lifelong learning strategies, and the group will conclude its work and publish its report in mid-2012.
Moreover, the thematic working group on maths, science and technology has already been established.
It comprises national policy makers and experts on the basis of mutual learning and the exchange of good practices.
The thematic working group will identify and disseminate policy measures to improve the situation of low achievers in basic skills at national level.
I should also underline that the Comenius actions of the lifelong learning programme focuses, among other priorities, on increasing motivation in science and mathematics and on improving literacy skills.
(LT) Mr President, I would like to ask, perhaps research has been done in some countries, which might explain pupils' low results and achievements?
Are these financial issues or structural issues?
What are your thoughts on primary education?
Research was carried out among pupils in upper years, but what about even younger people who intend to continue their studies?
Member of the Commission. - I can provide you with all the detailed data that we have on various Member States.
We have not analysed it, it is not our job to see why certain Member States did worse than others, but during our work, we exchanged good practices.
I am very pleased to say that some countries that have followed good practices have shown very good progress since 2006 in most of these indicators.
Regarding elementary school, unfortunately, we do not have studies similar to the PISA one.
No such study exists.
Subject: Fragmented digital markets and consequences for the educational system and investments in geographically isolated regions
According to the Commission Communication on a Digital Agenda for Europe, Europe is still a patchwork of national online markets, and Europeans are prevented from enjoying the benefits of a digital single market by solvable problems such as the lack of investment in networks.
As a result, the education provided in many remote - in particular, mountainous and island - regions lags behind technologically and investments in specific geographical locations are also affected.
Will the Commission say:
Since ICT accounts for 5% of European GDP, having a market value of € 660 billion annually, while making a much greater contribution to increasing total productivity (20% directly from the ICT sector and 30% from ICT investments), how does it intend to address the fragmentation of digital markets?
Are any targeted Community actions being developed to address the problem of low national investments in networks, especially for geographically isolated regions?
Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission's communication on Europe 2020 and its communication on the digital agenda for Europe set the objective of bringing basic broadband to all Europeans by 2013 and seek to ensure that by 2020, all Europeans have access to much higher Internet speeds of above 30 megabytes per second and that 50% or more of European households have subscribed to Internet connection above 100 megabytes per second.
Mr President, the Commission is aware that without strong public intervention, there is a risk of sub-optimal roll-out with fast proven networks concentrated in high-density zones and with remote and rural areas lagging behind.
That would also have negative consequences on educational systems and integration of information and communication technology in education.
The latest EU-wide data shows that only 67% of schools have broadband access and that there were large disparities between Member States and between densely and thinly populated areas, 73.7% and 60.6% respectively.
To avoid the risk of a sub-optimal roll-out, the Commission has adopted a broadband package outlining a common framework within both national and regional policies, which should be developed to meet the targets.
Those policies should, in particular, lower the cost of broadband deployment in the entire EU territory by ensuring proper planning and coordination and reducing administrative burdens.
The Commission has already acted to increase investment in remote areas and regions within the framework of the EU Cohesion Policy with the programming of about EUR 2.3 billion in the period 2007-2013.
The Commission's communication on a European economic recovery plan also enabled the programming of EUR 360 million in broadband measures for rural areas through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.
In its programme package, the Commission announced that it will reinforce and rationalise the funding of high-speed broadband through EU instruments by 2014 and explore how to attract capital for broadband investment through credit enhancement backed by the European Investment Bank and the EU funds.
An EC-EIB proposal on the issue is expected in 2011.
Another pillar from the digital agenda is dedicated to digital skills.
Here we propose, for instance, to consider digital literacy and competences as a priority for the European Social Fund regulation in the next programming period and to identify digital competences as a supplement to Europass to ensure their transparency.
Education, as you are aware, is crucial to the development of digital competences in our society and we agree that without appropriate investment, some regions may lag behind.
The latest EU-wide data - I am talking about 2006 - shows that only 67% of schools had broadband access and that there were large disparities between EU Member States and between densely and thinly populated areas.
We are about to launch a new survey on schools and the results will be available at the end of this year.
(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your very detailed reply.
I should like to add the following supplementary question: the EU 2020 strategy says that our objective is a digital single market for households and firms, which means equal opportunities in terms of access, but it also means equal opportunities in terms of development.
You personally have said, on occasion, in hearings before the competent committees, such as the Committee on Culture and Education, that approximately 500 000 new jobs will be needed in these sectors over the next five years.
I have a specific question: are we taking all the measures needed to ensure that these new jobs are distributed fairly, without excluding geographically remote areas?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the answer is yes.
That was very good.
Thank you very much indeed!
Subject: 116 000 Missing children hotline
The Commission has recently made a final call to EU Member States to activate the European missing children hotline 116 000 as soon as possible.
This telephone number would provide the necessary aid, assistance and support for children in their time of need.
At the moment, the 116 000 hotline is fully operational only in 12 Member States.
Does the Commission consider that the fact that the service is not operating in a full and proper manner throughout the EU could put children at risk?
Will people be informed if this service is not available in their country or in the country they are visiting?
Must every Member State implement this service correctly and in its entirety?
Is it not true that the failure to provide an adequate service throughout all Member States as regards this number may put children at risk?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission shares the honourable Member's view that the implementation of the 116 000 hotline for missing children requires further efforts in many Member States.
In that respect, the revised telecom rules - and, in particular, I refer to Article 27a of the Universal Service Directive - require Member States to make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to the service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children.
In that respect, the Commission is carefully monitoring and assisting Member States in the transposition of that new provision into national law, which has to be completed by 25 May 2011.
On 17 November last year, the Commission adopted the Communication entitled 'Dial 116 000: The European hotline for missing children'.
The objectives of the Communication are to renew the Commission's call on the Member States to implement the missing children hotline as a matter of priority and to ensure that the same high quality of service is offered throughout the Union to provide practical support to the Member States.
The Communication highlights existing best practice developed by the Member States to address the main problems linked to the operating cost and telecom cost of the 116 000 hotline.
The Commission proposes using this best practice to work out a set of common minimum standards that would guarantee a high quality service throughout the EU so that parents and children can count on the same assistance no matter where they are.
This extensive work goes beyond electronic communications issues for which I am responsible and is coordinated by my colleague, Mrs Reding.
Commissioner, in the past, you have identified cost and lack of information as barriers to the implementation of this hotline in some Member States.
What measures do you intend to put in place to address these barriers and, furthermore, do you foresee this service being fully implemented across all Member States?
Finally, what options are available to Member States that have problems financing this hotline to ensure it becomes operational throughout the European Union?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Of course we are trying to do our utmost.
The line taken by the honourable Member makes sense.
I was indeed, earlier on, taking the line that cost is one of the issues.
The hotline itself is the least part of the problem.
The problem is to follow up.
The issue that we should focus on is not just the hotline itself, but the follow-up.
We are carefully monitoring and assisting the Member States as regards implementation, and we are aware that it is up to them to take the initiative as regards national law.
We are also aware that, in the current financial crisis, it is even more difficult for Member States to find possibilities of financing the follow-up.
Some of those organisations have been the beneficiaries of EU funding for certain projects.
The EU funding available is not intended to cover the full running costs of the services' operations, but aims just to help develop the 116 000 services by means of concrete projects.
Of course, we need to be creative.
Those who are involved in such projects, and national governments, should also be creative in drawing on budgetary resources, corporate social responsibility and private donations to find the means, at the end of day, of doing what we should all like to be done.
Subject: Mainline railway through the Alps
How does the Commission view the current situation with regard to the construction of the Brenner base tunnel and the necessary approaches on either side, as well as the extension of the Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing-Salzburg railway?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the question of traffic across the Alps is an extremely serious one, but the situation does not look too bad at this stage.
Despite a difficult financial context, advances are being made on the Brenner Base Tunnel and its northern and southern access routes.
This project is of the highest priority, and the Commission decided to allocate to it a budget of almost EUR 1 billion.
First, on the Brenner Base Tunnel itself, the meeting of the Austrian-Italian Intergovernmental Commission on 19 November 2010, in the presence of EU coordinator Pat Cox, led to decisive progress.
Austria and Italy confirmed an agreement on the total cost of the Brenner Base Tunnel project at EUR 8 billion.
Austria approved an optimised working plan which will allow preparatory works on the main tunnel to start by 2011.
The Italian Government authorised the launch of the works with a commitment that guarantees coverage of the costs over the entire construction period.
Secondly, good progress can be reported on access route approaches on either side.
Italy has authorised the launch of works on the southern access route, starting with the first section, Fortezza-Ponte Gardena.
Good progress has also been made by Austria on the northern access route.
Austria has a section in the Lower Inn Valley which will be completed by 2013 or even sooner.
Finally, regarding the cross-border connections between Austria and Germany, the initial goal for completing the works by 2012 at the latest will not be achieved.
On the German side, works will not start before 2012 and will take an estimated three years.
However, in November 2010, Germany published its national investment assessment, which includes provision for positive development on the northern access route between Munich and the Austrian border.
The one-track section will be upgraded and the whole section will be electrified.
The next step will be a memorandum of understanding between Germany and Austria on this section and the infrastructure management planning process will have to start.
(DE) Thank you for your kind answer, Commissioner.
However, you have not answered the second part of the question in which I mentioned Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing, which is part of the main line from Paris to Budapest and which is particularly important in view of the Bavarian chemical triangle and for relief of the Brenner access route.
If the Brenner Base Tunnel is completed, then the Rosenheim section will be overloaded and it will then be important to develop Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing-Salzburg, which is also a highest priority project for the Commission.
I must ask you whether you consider it possible that additional funding can be made available for this in the next financial perspective, because this is, after all, a cross-border matter.
(EL) Commissioner, what is happening in the Alps is all well and good, but in Greece, because of the Memorandum, the Greek Government is making cutbacks and cuts to services, thereby isolating Greece from the European and Balkan railway network, citing, together with the Commission, the large debts of the Hellenic Railways.
My question, therefore, is this: what is your opinion of these developments, by which I mean the cuts to railway services?
Secondly, does the Hellenic Railways debt include the money for cofinancing infrastructure works together with the European Union?
Vice-President of the Commission. - About Greece, I am not able to answer because I do not know the details.
I have not received any information about these troubles.
About the Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing-Salzburg priority project number 17, it is ongoing.
The initial work started in 2007.
Some of the work is finished.
On 19 April 2010, the work on the new double-track bridge crossing of the river in Mühldorf started and will be finished.
It is fully funded by the German recovery plan.
It costs EUR 11.7 million, so it is developing and we do not consider this as a major trouble at this moment.
Subject: Texting while driving - road safety
A driver is 23 times more likely to be in an accident if texting.
Texting while driving is deemed to be responsible for thousands of road deaths annually, while the number of personal injuries rise at an alarming rate year on year.
While the Commission recognises the need to increase road safety and ensure proper enforcement of road safety rules, no EU-wide legislation exists which bans the practice of texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving a motorised vehicle above a pre-agreed speed limit.
Given that the technology already exists to prevent the practice of texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving, does the Commission intend to introduce EU-wide legislation in order to eliminate the extremely dangerous practice of texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving?
Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission shares the view of the honourable Member that texting while driving, like all extraneous activities, is extremely dangerous.
In 2009, the Commission issued a report on the use of mobile phones when driving.
This report is published on the Europa road safety website.
However, we have no statistics on the number of accidents caused by this practice.
All Member States have legislation which, at least implicitly, prohibits texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving.
While not specifically referring to the use of mobile phones, legal provisions in domestic legislation state that drivers must be fully concentrated on driving.
Against this background, the Commission does not intend to introduce an additional layer of EU-wide legislation in order to ban the practices of texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving a motorised vehicle.
We hope that Member States will deal with this issue adequately.
(GA) Mr President, I am disappointed with the reply I received from Commissioner Kallas.
It is extremely important to have cooperation between the different Member States.
We must do everything to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads.
One of the new phenomena on European roads is people texting while driving. All the Member States have different rules.
We must have more cooperation;
I am disappointed that the Commissioner cannot promise us more in relation to that.
I would like to compliment my colleague, Mr Higgins, on raising this very important issue.
I, too, share his concern at the lack of enthusiasm shown by the Commissioner to ensure that best practice is observed throughout the European Union.
I would ask him why the Commission would not at least try and encourage Member States to have the same rules and regulations right across the European Union, and ensure that they are enforced in the interests of safety and the preservation of life?
(ES) Mr President, I am just taking the floor to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that I am the rapporteur for the issue of cross-border penalties, in which the Council has been given the facility to open up the list of offences - which was, in fact, in the Commission's initial proposal - and in which the problem of the use of mobile phones appeared.
Unfortunately, neither the United Kingdom nor Ireland are participating in the change of legal basis provided by the Council agreement, as they have an opt-out.
This is one of the problems that we have, and which we in Parliament could perhaps improve.
I hope that, in the debate with the Council, these countries will make their interests clear, although we do not know anything about them.
It appears that the United Kingdom is now intending to opt in.
Vice-President of the Commission. - A broad safety action plan and implementation of that action plan have been extremely high priorities for the Commission, and there really has been tremendous progress: we have substantially reduced the number of accidents in Europe.
I can tell you that, in my own country, the annual death toll at the beginning of the 1990s was 400, whereas last year it was 78 - and that is, of course, with a tenfold increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.
It is a substantial change.
This is important, and thank you very much Ms Ayala Sender for reminding us about the cross-border enforcement of traffic violations, which is an extremely important step towards improving road safety.
That decision was adopted by the Council in December and we will now implement it.
I do not believe that increasing the number of legislative acts at European level is a panacea: that whatever problem we have, we must have European legislation.
However, while everybody criticises the fact that we have too much EU legislation, in my view, this is an issue about which Member States are as worried as the European public in general, and if cross-border enforcement of traffic violations can create a European space for road safety, that is very important.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles (debate)
The next item is the report by Martin Callanan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles - C7-0271/2009 -.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I am delighted to be able to open our debate today on my report about emissions from light commercial vehicles (LCVs).
Before I get to the detail of the text, please allow me to express a few thanks: first of all, to the shadow rapporteurs from all of the political groups; secondly, to the rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their opinions; and thirdly, to the Commissioner and her team - we have had a number of very constructive meetings about this.
Fourthly, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very hard work during the trialogue negotiations; finally, my thanks go to Jos Vervloet and Isobel Findlay from the ENVI secretariat, who have provided some incredible support throughout the process.
In particular, Isobel's help on the complex comitology issues is very much appreciated.
The proposed legislation has been expected ever since similar legislation was passed concerning passenger cars.
Personally, I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation because most vans are bought by businesses, both large and small, which are already very conscious of the need for economy and fuel efficiency.
Because of this, it has been my belief throughout the process that it is crucial to have an ambitious but realistic long-term target and an appropriate short-term target that takes into account both the needs of industry product cycles and the need for environmental improvement.
It has always been the long-term target that has been the main focus throughout our debate.
The Commission's original proposal was 135g CO2/km, which was deemed by many sources to be simply unachievable.
The LCV sector has longer development and production times than the passenger car sector.
Similarly, LCVs, as their name implies, are used mainly for commercial purposes. Unlike passenger cars, there is less scope to modify either their shape or their weight in a bid to reduce emissions.
The principal way to accomplish this in LCVs is through modification of the engines and mechanics of the vehicles - a much longer and more expensive process than simply altering the body or reducing the weight of the vehicle.
It should also be noted that there is already much greater penetration of diesel fuel usage in the LCV sector than in the car sector.
When the Commission published its original proposal, many of the manufacturers made it clear that they wished to settle for nothing less than 160g CO2/km, a figure which, in turn, struck most of us in Parliament as being far too relaxed and complacent.
In the end, the package that we have all agreed on, and which is before you today, has a fairly sensible compromise position of 147g CO2/km.
Given the higher costs of reducing CO2 in LCVs compared to cars and the longer development and production cycles needed, my personal belief is that this provides a good balance between ensuring improved environmental standards, on the one hand, and giving a realistic and achievable target for the LCV manufacturing sector, on the other.
The fact that, by reaching this compromise figure, we are being attacked on one side as being too pro-industry and on the other as being too environmentally friendly, suggests to me that possibly, we have just about got the balance right.
One area of the Commission's proposal which all groups agreed was unworkable concerned the very complex issue of multi-stage vehicles.
Obviously, it is unfair to penalise the manufacturers of the base vehicle when they are not responsible for what happens to the vehicle at a later stage of its production.
The package that is before you today includes a very sensible proposal that the Commission will review this issue before the end of the year and sets out the basis under which this review should take place.
I believe that the package that we have negotiated, and which will be put before Parliament today as amendment 58, is the best possible outcome.
I am pleased to have the support - I hope - of most of the main political groups.
It balances the need for improved environmental standards with realistic and achievable targets that will not prejudice manufacturing industry nor pose a risk to jobs in the Union.
Generally, I am not in favour of first-reading agreements, believing that they are best avoided if at all possible.
However, in this case, a first-reading agreement provides clarity and certainty to a sector that is still suffering in the wake of the global economic crisis, whilst also setting the bar for the tough but fair environmental standards that we all wish to see.
I hope that colleagues will join me in supporting the package today.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, and the shadow rapporteurs, on their efforts in reaching agreement on the Commission proposal on light commercial vehicles.
In the aftermath of the economic downturn, as Mr Callanan mentioned, these discussions were indeed difficult.
Let me be clear: the compromise package resulting from these interinstitutional discussions is less ambitious than the Commission proposal on a number of points.
Mainly, full compliance with the short-term target is delayed by one year; the level of the penalty for non-compliance - the 'excess emissions premium' - has been lowered; and the ambition of the long-term target has been decreased.
It will therefore not come as a surprise to anybody if I say that I would have preferred a more ambitious outcome, and many of you probably share that view.
Nevertheless, this compromise still represents an important step forward.
By 2020, it will bring down the average CO2 emissions of vans from the 2007 baseline of 203 grams of CO2 per kilometre to 147 grams per kilometre.
This will mean an average emission reduction in the van fleet of 28% over 13 years.
In view of the expected growing demand for light commercial vehicles, the increased efficiency will represent an important contribution to the reduction of transport emissions.
The compromise will also generate lifetime net savings for consumers, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, of over EUR 2 200 per vehicle.
Moreover, the targets will stimulate innovation in industry and enable manufacturers to take advantage of the transition to a low carbon economy and thus enhance their long-term competitiveness.
Let us not forget that this regulation should give manufacturers a first mover advantage in world markets where similar CO2 standards are likely to follow and the demand for efficient vehicles is expected to rise.
In addition, this regulation will close a major regulatory gap between cars and vans and therefore minimise potential perverse effects on the regulation on CO2 in passenger cars.
Large cars will not be able to escape the CO2 emission standards simply by changing the vehicle's category to 'van' when type-approved.
Finally, as you know, transport is today emitting more than in 1990, thus offsetting to a large extent the reductions made in other sectors.
This is, of course, not sustainable.
Transport must make a substantial contribution to the EU's overall CO2 targets.
This regulation is one more instrument that will help the Member States to meet their 2020 commitments to reduce CO2 from sectors outside the EU ETS.
I believe that this agreement is yet more proof of the European Union's commitment towards meeting its climate goals and I hope that you will lend your support to the compromise package when you vote later today.
Mr President, the first reading should be the exception.
In this case, it was possible because we came to a compromise between the proposals of the Commission, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the most controversial topic.
The fact that we went into the negotiations with a common negotiating mandate from all the groups is the only thing which enabled us to produce this result.
I would like to thank Mr Callanan in particular for the commitment he has shown.
We can be proud of what we have achieved.
The result is identical in many areas to the proposal made by the Industry Committee.
I believe that we have launched an ambitious project which is achievable for industry and which will, in particular, give users the opportunity to buy affordable, modern vehicles with lower CO2 emissions.
This applies specifically to small and medium-sized businesses, tradespeople, retailers and micro-enterprises which use this type of vehicle.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
There is an item in my dossier for the Industry Committee which was not incorporated, but which nevertheless was adopted with a narrow majority.
It concerns the proposal for speed limiters.
This is now a matter for the Member States, which will have to establish their own regulations.
Overall, we are therefore pleased with the compromise.
The Industry Committee is prepared to support the entire package.
Mr President, it is true that transport is one of the sectors where emissions need to be reduced.
In our rush to cut emissions, however, we should not undermine the competitiveness of European car manufacturers.
This requirement is particularly pressing in view of the ongoing financial crisis, which has had serious repercussions on the European car industry so far.
From this perspective, I consider the achievement of 147g CO2/km for the average emissions of new vans to be rather ambitious, and I am very curious to see the feasibility study which the Commission is to draw up on the basis of the updated results.
At the same time, I am following with great attention the repeated efforts of the Commission and certain other parties, for whom the proposed target seems, on the contrary, rather unambitious, to reopen the debate on this topic and to try and change this regulation in order to set more stringent targets.
I firmly believe that the economic actors need certainty that the legislation will not be changing all the time.
It is now time to give car manufacturers breathing space to work and to develop new engines so that they can adjust to the regulations and the new objectives.
In conjunction with this, I think we should keep our eyes firmly fixed on justification 24, which considers expanding the use of speed limiters to light commercial vehicles as well.
I am pleased that we will be addressing this issue in particular and that this debate will be businesslike and not ideological.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must stick to our time slots, since we have a full programme and the vote is at midday.
Mr President, today, I am representing Mrs Weisgerber, our shadow rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who is on maternity leave.
We all send her our very best wishes.
She has done an excellent job on this dossier.
Overall, we are all pleased with the compromise.
It was not as difficult to achieve as in the case of cars, because this is not such an emotional subject.
Nevertheless, we faced major environmental and economic challenges.
From a climate policy perspective, it is important that the load is distributed evenly along all the links in the chain and this link must make its contribution.
However, we also had to ensure that we did not grind so much off this link that we caused it to break.
What do I mean by that?
Of course, the costs involved in measures of this kind for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent a significant challenge for them.
Small businesses will be considering very carefully whether it is worthwhile replacing their old vehicle and investing in a new one.
Therefore, we had to focus less on the technical aspects and more on the economic ones.
In technical terms, we could have achieved a great deal more, but the costs would definitely have been passed on to the SMEs and that would not have produced the desired results.
We will have to wait for a few years to find out whether this regulation is a good one, because that will only be the case if we actually reach the required emission levels.
If we end up imposing fines, then we will not have achieved our objective.
We must keep a very close eye on how the situation develops.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively.
We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective.
Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles.
We must not forget that.
Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves.
If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality.
With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution.
This means that the air quality in our cities will improve.
We are taking an important step forward today.
My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area.
This was a fundamental requirement for our group.
I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package.
Some comments have already been made about the first reading.
We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements.
In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams.
We did not need to introduce that into the second reading.
However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights.
There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle.
It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality.
Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area.
International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles.
I would like to thank everyone concerned once again.
Today is a good day for the European Union's climate and environmental policy.
Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended.
This should depend on the dossier.
How are the discussions going?
How controversial are they?
In the case of the regulation of CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart.
Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target.
The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years - these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard - can be implemented in an economically viable way.
This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets.
Parliament's most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms.
This is what we have done.
I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world.
We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world's climate.
I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work.
I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for being extremely professional and inclusive when conducting the negotiations.
However, I will not be expressing my thanks for the agreement.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that the Commission's original proposal was a good and realistic one, but unfortunately, the agreement that has been reached is far too weak.
It will not do the competitiveness of the car industry any good.
The question is where are we going to sell cars in 2020?
Well, we will sell them in Asia, and there they will demand extremely low energy vehicles.
So if we want to benefit the competitiveness of the industry, we should set much higher targets.
The agreement will not benefit the environment either because, even if every commercial vehicle emits 28% less, no one believes that the amount of traffic will not increase by 2020.
Thus, the emissions targets aimed at a reduction of 30%, which we will presumably achieve through the negotiations in Durban in South Africa, will not be met either.
Moreover, not even the economy will benefit from this, because no one is expecting the price of petrol in 2020 to be around SEK 13 or EUR 1.30 per litre.
It will, of course, be much higher than that.
Thus, the calculations on which the Commission's original proposal was based were much more realistic and even then they were almost too high to be able to make effective economic calculations.
So, unfortunately, this agreement will not benefit competitiveness, the economy or the environment.
On the contrary, I believe that natural technical progress will actually go further than this agreement states.
The planning horizon for the industry will be worse because consumers in 2020 will almost certainly demand cars that emit no more than 120 g CO2/km.
It is also unfortunate that we reduced the fines for those who do not achieve the targets.
That means we will not even achieve the goal of the legislation - unless it turns out as I believe it will: in other words, that we will nevertheless achieve this by means of natural progress.
It is the same with super-credits: they fool us into believing that the emissions are lower than they really are if an electric car is counted three times.
Unfortunately, therefore, we cannot support this agreement, but I would nevertheless like to thank all those involved.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for moderating part of this debate in Czech.
However, I would chiefly like to thank the rapporteurs and the lead rapporteur, Martin Callanan, for the work they have done.
The law we are debating relates to climate change policy as we know it from the European Parliament, and this is not the place to be criticising the policy and the entire concept.
It is necessary to realise that these are predominantly unilateral steps by the European Parliament, which have no counterparts outside the EU in the rest of the world.
We must consider what would be a sensible motivation and what would be an unreasonable burden for European businesses, and I firmly believe that this report has come close to a sensible motivation.
In this case, I strongly disagree with what was said by the previous speaker, Carl Schlyter.
European competitiveness is not and will not be assisted by hobbling European industry.
All the evidence so far points to the fact that European industry is on the decline and is relocating beyond our borders.
The measures in the area of vans are far more complicated than for cars, and place a greater burden on small businesses, as has already been said here.
I would like to end by thanking all of the rapporteurs. I regard the compromise that has been reached as an outstanding piece of work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU's CO2 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures.
It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down.
The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles.
I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry.
In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race.
If Parliament would at least support the Commission's proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive.
The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2 per kilometre.
Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020.
In my opinion, that would have been feasible.
Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020.
This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry.
Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further.
Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes.
This report is unacceptable.
It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, my father is a small businessman.
He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic, Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s.
Like all small businessmen, he is overburdened with red tape and regulation - much of it emanating from this place, the European Parliament.
My father's small business remains small.
However, these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the British economy and they amount to a staggering 73% of all businesses in the UK.
My father drives a van, and like many small businesses, he is struggling due to the recession.
I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father's out of business for ever, because we are told that this legislation will, in fact, put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans.
Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife.
The gentleman from the Socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the EU.
However, if this goes through, I guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8))
Mr President, why does the honourable gentleman not understand that this measure is designed to improve the fuel efficiency of light commercial vehicles?
That means reducing the costs of driving them, mile by mile, at a time when fuel prices are at a record high.
This helps businesses, not hinders them.
Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world.
People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does - and it has been made quite clear to us - is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent.
It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000.
That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession.
Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things.
The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore.
Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears.
The second is the car park beneath us - Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex - Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs - all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading.
While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history.
Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world's poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels.
But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not?
No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis - not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation.
Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature's most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy.
If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President, Mr Griffin was wrong when he said that this has been a cold winter across the globe.
It was actually just some parts of northern Europe and some central parts of the USA.
Globally, 2010 was one of the two hottest years in recorded history.
The fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable, because if the Gulf Stream is pressed down by meltwater from the Arctic, this is an explainable effect.
So no, 2010 was a very hot year, climate change is real and the measures we are taking are good for the economy.
Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places.
Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades.
Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream.
There has been no change in that whatsoever.
Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago.
They did not.
A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was.
What an absolute nonsense this has been.
Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world's weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source.
They are virtually all in cities.
The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down.
That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on securing this agreement.
It was a difficult agreement to reach, as our debates have clearly shown.
I think everyone will agree with what has been said.
Yes, of course, climate change exists, but commercial vehicles are not vehicles that people buy for the sheer pleasure of driving or because they are passionate about them.
They are vehicles that people use as a tool for their work, which means that the target of 147 grams of CO2 by 2020 strikes the right balance.
I would have even preferred slightly more, but at least this is a proposal that seems to me to be more balanced than the one initially put forward by the Commission.
That proposal would have resulted in technological targets being imposed on manufacturers, with the associated innovation costs having a major financial impact on end consumers, who we do not want to penalise, given that they are going through an exceptional period of crisis.
Nevertheless, I embrace the introduction of incentives for manufacturing high-efficiency vehicles and of penalties for car manufacturers that do not meet the targets.
Therefore, all this is really a step in the right direction.
I am also glad to see that there are penalties.
I am pleased that we have been able to find common ground regarding penalties which are the same as those applied to passenger vehicles.
For these reasons, I will be delighted to vote in favour of this report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector.
I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2/km by 2020.
This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules.
I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector.
Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles.
I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research.
Mr President, maybe we should question whether or not we might have achieved more if this measure had been introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial vehicles rather than to reduce CO2.
In practice, of course, it is the same, but one is seen as a cost to business, and the other as a saving.
Mr Nuttall says that this measure will increase the price of vehicles by EUR 5 000.
I suspect it will not increase it by a single euro.
Let us have this debate in three years' time and see who is right.
The fact is that oil prices are now at USD 100 a barrel.
That is more than the Commission estimated when it undertook its assessments.
The potential savings to business are greater, and I wish the EPP would recognise this.
The EPP has been talking on behalf of big business, of the manufacturers, instead of on behalf of all the businesses which use light commercial vehicles and which need more fuel-efficient technology to drive down costs.
The manufacturers have made great technological progress over recent years.
We should be driving forward that ambition.
I hope that the Commission will come back in its review in a couple of years' time and ensure that this ambition has a chance to be properly realised.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))
Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles?
He knows it will, and I know it will.
In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester - in his own constituency - out of business.
Does he think that is fair?
Does he think it is morally correct?
Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years' time?
Mr President, the UK Government, in the form of the Department for Transport, actually undertook an assessment of the effects of this measure.
It found they were likely to be more beneficial to businesses than even the Commission had estimated.
The net savings on running a vehicle, when fuel prices are at record highs, are greater than any potential increase in the cost of the vehicles - net savings for businesses and lower prices for consumers.
This is what the UK Independence Party is so determined to fight against.
In doing so, it wants businesses to pay more than they need.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal initially set a long-term emissions limit of 135g CO2/km for light commercial vehicles, to be achieved by 2020.
However, in the unanimous opinion of manufacturers, it was technically impossible to respect this limit.
If the report had been approved as it was, the level of CO2 would have been reduced by 0.00014% at a global level, compared to an extremely high economic impact of more than EUR 45 billion for Europe alone, which would inevitably lead to an average price hike of around EUR 3 800 per vehicle.
Despite these problematic issues, an agreement was reached with the Council at first reading that sets the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 at 147g CO2/km, subject to feasibility, which must be assessed by the Commission before January 2013.
In any case, this decision is purely political and has absolutely nothing to do with real industrial or market conditions, or consumer interests.
We will be voting against the report, because we believe that the economic impact is excessive in relation to the insignificant reduction of CO2 at a global level.
(ES) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result.
It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one.
The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union.
It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union's objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation.
This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers.
I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic.
Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020.
I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union's objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year.
However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels.
Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU's objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020.
I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020.
Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success.
(SV) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, the shadow rapporteurs and everyone else involved in the work on this directive.
We will now finally also have a regulatory instrument for emissions from light commercial vehicles, and that is important.
The directive now needs to be introduced as quickly as possible.
At the same time, we did not go as far as many of us would have liked, and I think we should talk openly and honestly about that.
What we are seeing is an environmental and industrial policy decision that has clearly been influenced by the economic crisis and by the fact that so many European governments, conservative, right-leaning governments, have chosen to respond to this economic crisis by simply making cuts and not making any investments.
The result of this is high unemployment and low demand, and it is affecting both the passenger car industry and the light commercial vehicle industry.
Of course, this could be called realism, but what it amounts to is enforced adaptation to the economic crisis and a policy of cuts.
The Commission was therefore more ambitious even than Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and that is unusual.
I am grateful for the fact that this decision nevertheless contains a review of the emissions targets for 2014.
I therefore hope that we will get another chance to show that we mean business when it comes to not allowing competitiveness and lofty ambitions on climate policy to conflict with each other, but instead enabling these two factors to drive each other forward.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it is with reluctance that I will vote for the final compromise.
The negotiations were dreadful, and to my mind, this vote is a decision imposed as a result of the power play within Parliament and the Council.
The major producing countries, supported by a majority of MEPs who are sensitive to the industry's arguments, have succeeded in preventing us from setting an ambitious emissions reduction target.
I would point out that the Commission had suggested a target of 135 grams per kilometre by 2020.
Parliament is therefore being less ambitious than the Commission, and that is regrettable.
The automotive industry, which fought against this text - and we have just had some more examples of this - has evidently not realised that it has everything to gain from pioneering a reduction in emissions, especially since the study by the European Federation for Transport and Environment carried out last November showed that technological solutions do exist.
The study notes that car manufacturers in Europe reduced CO2 emissions for non-commercial vehicles by 2-10% in 2009, and that one Japanese manufacturer has all but reached its target six years early.
I will vote for this compromise because we run the risk of destroying this achievement, as small as it may be, with a second reading.
However, I would stress that we are not doing manufacturers any favours by defending the status quo and that, as far as the public authorities are concerned, by failing to encourage innovation, they are not fulfilling their role.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome we have arrived at is extremely ambitious.
I should like to note that CO2 emissions from these vehicles are currently around 200 g per square kilometre.
Reducing this to 147 g therefore cuts this threshold by more than 25%.
Furthermore, I would emphasise that marginal reductions are the most costly, so we should be careful.
I also think that this particular category of vehicles cannot be compared to passenger cars, as has often been the case in this House.
The cycles of production are much longer and it would have a mere 1.5% effect on CO2 emissions across the whole transport sector.
If we do not establish our central aim, we will end up penalising a sector that has already suffered an abrupt contraction of more than 30%, above all, hurting small and medium-sized enterprises, which, just 12 hours ago, all of us in this House confirmed we wanted to support due to the huge economic and social role they play as the only true engine of employment in Europe.
We must therefore be very careful.
I applaud the work that has been done, but we do need to exercise careful supervision.
(NL) Mr President, the text before us is, indeed, a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there, particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties.
On the other hand, it is important that emission standards are established for this category of vehicles - something which seems to have slipped through the net a bit, seeing as a number of rules already exist for both passenger cars and goods vehicles.
The trend is heading in the right direction, but - as you have said yourself - the number of LCVs has increased enormously in recent years and it looks as if that number will continue to rise in years to come.
As a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to return briefly to speed limits.
We in the Committee have proposed that the speed limit be set at 120 kilometres per hour from 2018, which is really not unreasonable.
As you know, there is already a limit for goods vehicles, and I think that, for both environmental and road safety reasons, it would be advisable to lay this down in law.
It seems to me that you have to do that at European level, because there is little sense in leaving this to Member States.
Consequently, Commissioner, I would like to invite you to revisit this issue, together with your colleague, Mr Kallas - he is here in the Chamber with us - study it and put forward a proposal.
I think that this would be a positive thing for your respective areas of responsibility: the environment and road safety.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, we are not here today to hold a discussion on the climate.
Instead, we simply need to do what is possible.
I welcome the compromise that has been reached.
By restricting emissions to 147 grams per kilometre from 2020, we are setting very clear standards.
This will create incentives for the development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency and combat climate change.
The users of the vehicles will also benefit from these innovations, which will save them fuel and therefore money.
Small vans are primarily used by tradespeople, small and medium-sized companies, farmers and winegrowers.
They generally only travel short distances and are often driven for many years until the company is passed on to the next owner.
Therefore, the costs of these vehicles must remain manageable.
Higher investment costs must be funded on the basis of energy efficiency and energy savings.
The long-term goal of 2020 leaves enough time for transition periods so that research organisations and the industry can develop and manufacture new engines.
The target which we have set for ourselves is realistic, achievable and still efficient.
I hope that it will receive broad support.
(PL) Mr President, everyone involved in road transport, both manufacturers of passenger vehicles and manufacturers of light commercial vehicles, should contribute to limiting overall CO2 emissions.
I therefore welcome the compromise worked out by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, which sets limits on emissions and penalties for non-compliance with these limits.
Setting mandatory and ambitious limits which are also realistic will pose a challenge to the innovative potential of the European automotive industry.
It will act as an incentive to step up research and development efforts aimed at finding new design solutions which can be used to manufacture vehicles which are more environmentally friendly.
We must have our own green technologies so that we can avoid importing vehicles, as has been the case with hybrid technology.
I believe that the legislative decisions we have taken will act as an appropriate stimulus to mobilise European manufacturers, who will realise that green technologies represent an opportunity for development.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his position, and I note that Parliament finds itself in a tight corner between a Commission that is very ambitious and a Council that is, as usual, cautious, between climate sceptics and climate critics, and between industry supporters and environmentalists.
This is therefore a balanced position that remains ambitious, since the target of 147 grams in 2020 will give industry the time to make the technological leap while simultaneously encouraging it to be highly efficient.
The extension of the amendment period until 2018 is positive and will make research into, and the production of, non-polluting vehicles more attractive.
I would like to make two comments by way of conclusion.
Naturally, I welcome the fact that the proposal has been passed at first reading, and I did not fully understand the comments by our fellow Member just now, when he said that he preferred second readings.
Secondly, like Mr El Khadraoui, I deplore the absence of speed limitation devices, as it means that we will continue to be overtaken on motorways by the only vehicles that no longer keep to the speed limit, namely, light commercial vehicles.
(RO) Mr President, this regulation marks a step forward in terms of gradually achieving the CO2 emission reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe.
This will be possible to achieve by creating incentive schemes for making vehicles more efficient and by imposing penalties on manufacturers who do not meet these targets.
However, I do not think that the new legislation on CO2 reduction should jeopardise the position of either car manufacturers or the customer.
The new regulations must pay heed to the concerns of SMEs and European car manufacturers, which are asking for the gradual introduction of the pollution limits to start after 2015, as the vehicles which will be sold in 2014 are already at the development and production stage.
The figure of 147 grams is an acceptable compromise compared to the figures which have been mentioned.
However, the Commission must monitor closely relations between the car industry and users to assess this measure's impact on prices and, by extension, on the activity of small enterprises.
(PL) Mr President, the manufacture of light commercial vehicles and related technological issues require much greater investment and a longer-term strategic plan and manufacturing cycle than is the case for passenger vehicles.
Approval of such a long-term goal was essential in this respect in order to provide industry with guaranteed security of manufacturing.
On the other hand, we should not neglect the target limit of 147 g to be achieved by 2020.
The initial short-term goal which has been set of a limit of 175 g, with a view to achieving the goal of 147 g by 2020, will significantly increase the cost of manufacturing light commercial vehicles, making them more expensive for many small companies which use them as tools for their daily work.
I hope that this will not result in a marked drop in sales of new vehicles, which, in turn, would mean that technologically older vehicles which are responsible for much higher levels of emissions would stay on the roads longer.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise reached with the Council certainly seems more balanced and realistic compared with the initial proposal of the Commission, which was so ambitious that it appeared utopian in parts, as it did not take industrial conditions and the impact on the market into due consideration.
Overly ideological environmentalism always runs the risk of making tangible results less likely, resulting in harm being done to the environment.
In my opinion, despite the fact that the long-term objective of 147g CO2/km by 2020 is not yet optimal, it could turn out to be more reasonable and realistic than what was originally proposed.
I also welcome the planned incentives for eco-innovations but, in my opinion, a critical issue remains: the decision on emissions from so-called completed vehicles, meaning those built in a number of stages.
I hope the Commission respects its commitment to submit a specific legislative proposal on this before the end of this year.
(RO) Mr President, I welcome the fine job which the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, and my colleague, Mr Groote, have done in completing this report.
This regulation will force car manufacturers to develop new green technologies and, although this seemingly imposes a new burden on them, it may boost the car industry's competitiveness on the global market.
At the same time, it will help meet CO2 emission reduction commitments, in line with the European Union's strategy.
The compromise amendments which have been agreed provide sufficient time for manufacturers to prepare the implementation of new technologies, as well as for the Commission to develop an effective mechanism for monitoring breaches of the provisions in this area.
(PT) Mr President, the management of innovation, in other words, the research and development of new technologies and production processes, their implementation on a large scale and the choice of the appropriate time to implement them, should have the protection of the public interest, improvement of quality of life for the public and environmental protection, first and foremost, as its guiding criteria.
These principles, rather than the narrow commercial interests of industry and business, should primarily guide the efforts towards innovation and the management of their implementation.
This also applies to the case of vehicle emissions.
Given that the transport sector accounts for a substantial proportion of CO2 emissions, an appropriate part of the efforts at reduction should be focused on this area.
It is therefore important to pursue an increase in vehicle energy efficiency, a reduction in fuel consumption and, in general, the development of low carbon technologies.
This is now made possible by scientific and technical developments, which take into account the progressive and inexorable scarcity of fossil fuels at the very outset, something that it is already vital to heed.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I will be brief.
I am going to vote for this text because I believe that this compromise is a step in the right direction.
At the same time, however, I regret that it has not gone as far as the proposal made by Mrs Hedegaard.
Therefore, I would now like you to tell us, following the debate and before the vote in a few hours' time, what the procedure you are going to adopt for the next two years consists of, since a review is due to take place in 2013, thus allowing us without delay, as our group rapporteur Mr Groote wanted, to take this fight further in order to reduce pollution by these light commercial vehicles.
That is my question to you, Commissioner, and I know that you will be tenacious so that we can make progress in spite of this industrial lobbying, which I, like a number of my fellow Members who have spoken on this matter, consider inappropriate.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, I cannot conceal the fact that I am one of those people who would much rather have adopted a target of 135 grams today.
However, I believe that this compromise reflects reality and shows that we are prepared to make a serious joint effort to limit and reduce CO2 emissions.
The European Union has recently succeeded in reducing overall CO2 emissions by 9%.
However, emissions in the transport sector have increased by almost 30%.
Purely from this perspective, I believe that the move we are making today is another step in the right direction.
However, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the fact that the real problems in the transport sector lie elsewhere, given the overall increase of 29%.
In other words, we need to focus heavily on developing public transport.
We must not increase the burdens on small and medium-sized companies.
Instead, we must make things easier for commuters and speed up the construction of railways.
We will achieve much more by moving from individual transport to public transport.
I think we are taking the first step in the right direction because, after all, we are talking about a reduction of 25%.
(NL) Mr President, I wish to congratulate everyone, but I would have liked to have seen a more ambitious result.
Much more ambitious.
And why?
I will give you five reasons: more innovation, greater competitiveness for Europe, the environment, obviously, because this could have saved us raw materials, and it would have been cheaper for the consumer, too.
We in Europe are very dependent on imports of raw materials for energy.
With cleaner technology, we would have made many more savings and we would also have given an enormous impetus to our strong automotive industry to come up with clean, intelligent technology which could be sold anywhere in the rest of the world and which could have given us a headstart.
This would have been cheaper and more efficient, precisely because we are so dependent on imports.
It would also have translated into savings for the consumer.
The purchase price might have been higher, but it would ultimately have worked out cheaper per kilometre.
That would have been very much of interest to small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.
For the Dutch, the saying 'Look after the cents and the euros will look after themselves' is still very interesting!
(ES) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially our shadow rapporteur, Mr Groote, for a proposal that will encourage our industry to become greener.
However, I find it deeply regrettable that we have lost a golden opportunity to introduce speed limiters, which are essential tools for helping improve air quality.
I must point out that the directive has already been compulsory for more than a month and a half, as demonstrated in cities such as Barcelona, where the socialist council has set the speed limit at 80 km per hour, and the difference has been felt compared with other cities such as Madrid or Valencia that have conservative councils, where the population is at high risk of suffering from allergies and respiratory diseases.
Speed limiters would have helped us to reduce these problems, and also to improve road safety and cut the number of human lives lost.
It is therefore regrettable, and we trust that we will be able to achieve this in future legislation.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first, a brief remark to Mr Pargneaux who asked what the plan was for the next few years.
First, of course, as we have agreed, the Commission must assess the progress made and ascertain whether things are feasible.
That is what we have all agreed, but, of course, we have reason to believe that it is feasible because our impact assessment has already demonstrated this.
We are aware of the cost and consequences of whatever we do, and the level we choose to impose.
So we believe that it will be feasible but we are, of course, looking into this.
I would just like to say that reopening the debate as to the 2020 target could lead to uncertainty in planning, so, of course, we should now stress that a long-term target has been set.
Many manufacturers appreciate that because that gives them the long-term planning that they really need, the predictability that they need.
In the end, they appreciate that.
That was also an answer to Mr Vlasák and his concerns.
Just a brief remark to Mr Nuttall - I do not know if he is still here - or rather to Mr Nuttall's father, because he has absolutely nothing to worry about, except that his son is using figures from a source I am not familiar with.
The fact is that the cost of doing this is much less than Mr Nuttall claimed and the money saved in fuel consumption is greater than the cost.
So, in the end, Mr Nuttall's father will not only save money, but will have a net gain.
He can also explain that his children and his grandchildren will have cleaner air.
At the same time, what we are trying to do here is to boost innovation in a very important industrial sector for Europe.
This is what we are trying to do.
Wrapping up this debate, I would just say that we have the benefit of the wide-ranging experience we have gained in the field of car legislation.
In every case, it turned out that the manufacturers could comply with legislation faster and with less expenditure than they had claimed.
I would not be surprised if the same thing happens with vans.
So regulation for cars is in place.
Now it is the turn of vans.
I appreciate the very broad support for this piece of legislation.
The next thing we have to look into in this field will be heavy-duty vehicles and there, of course, I greatly look forward to working in cooperation with the European Parliament.
rapporteur. - Mr President, let me respond briefly to many of the points that have been made.
Mr Schlyter said he thought it was bad for European industry and it would result in more light commercial vehicles being built in Asia.
I have to say that I simply do not understand that remark.
We are setting the most challenging targets in the world by far, much tighter than the rules in the States or anything that exists in China or the Far East.
Mrs Wils compared this regulation with the passenger car regulation.
In my view, that is a false comparison.
The opportunities to reduce emissions in passenger cars are much greater in terms of lightweighting and changing the fuel mix.
There is already a much higher diesel penetration in the vans market.
Of course, by their nature, vans are already much more utilitarian and are bought by business customers.
Mr Nuttall, I am afraid, has not stayed for the end of this debate, but he is wrong in the figures that he has given.
This will result in overall cost savings for many businesses.
I have to say that I would have a little more respect for the remarks that he made if indeed the EFD Group had bothered to send a single representative to any of our trialogue meetings or to any of our shadow meetings to make the point that they are fond of quoting on behalf of small businesses.
(Applause)
In conclusion, I think this is a good result.
It produces the best balance, first of all, in favour of costs for businesses, but also in terms of environmental improvement.
Whatever view you take of climate change, fuel efficiency - using precious resources more efficiently - has to be a good thing.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday today (15 February 2011).
Written statements (Rule 149)
in writing. - The agreement which has been reached with Council is the result of tough negotiations in the face of intense lobbying from industry.
Throughout the whole process, we have resisted heavy pressure from manufacturers to weaken the regulation and, in particular, to reduce the ambition of the long-term CO2 reduction targets.
It was a difficult dilemma, as many of us have car industries which are already struggling because of the economic context.
But we knew from our experience with the passenger cars regulation that the car industry has made enormous progress in terms of innovation and developing cleaner technology because the legislative framework encouraged them in the right direction.
We wanted to repeat this success with legislation for vans - not just for environmental reasons, but because greater fuel efficiency will ultimately bring costs down for many businesses.
We have a compromise text which, although not as ambitious as we would have liked, will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from vans and contribute to the EU's emission reduction ambitions for 2020 and beyond.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadows on their successful negotiations with the Council.
The road transport sector is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, and its emissions have not stopped increasing.
All types of vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, should therefore be covered by regulations aimed at reducing these emissions.
The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be better achieved if there is legislation covering the whole EU, rather than national legislation with different objectives.
That said, we need to combine ambition with realism and good sense.
Therefore, and given that small and medium-sized enterprises are most likely to use light commercial vehicles, and that these make up 99.8% of companies and 67.4% of jobs within the EU, we should not pursue goals that might jeopardise them.
I therefore agree with the target of 147 g of CO2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the EU, if it is confirmed that this option is viable.
I also welcome the fact that a single speed limit for this type of vehicle has not been introduced at EU level.
I welcome this measure, as it is very important that a balance be maintained between protecting the environment and protecting jobs and the competitiveness of SMEs in the EU.

Media law in Hungary (
- Before the vote:
Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal.
Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments - all the amendments - requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members.
Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts.
The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament.
My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world?
Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law?
(Applause)
In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes?
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality.
Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores?
(Applause)
Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same.
The credibility of Parliament is at stake.
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is completely clear.
As I understand it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has withdrawn its resolution.
We have, therefore, only one resolution, which has been submitted by several of the political groups.
I would like to ask the representatives of the political groups to comment on this.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Daul talked about reality.
Well, it is reality that the Hungarian Government or the Hungarian Parliament has amended the law, and that is a good thing, because I can remember the debate in this Chamber when some people said - including you, Mr Daul - that nothing needed to be amended; everything was fine.
Suddenly, it now needs to be amended.
(Applause from the left)
However, it is also reality - and you can read this, too - that both the media freedom representative of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the representative of the Council of Europe say that these amendments are inadequate.
That is the reality, Mr Daul.
That is the reality.
(Applause from the left)
In our group's meeting yesterday evening, which I chaired, we discussed the law and the amendments and - like the OSCE and the Council of Europe - we came to the conclusion that these amendments are inadequate.
Whatever decision is made today - whether you win, Mr Daul, or whether we win - we will not give up the fight for freedom of the media, Mr Lange.
If you do so, that is your business.
(Applause from the left)
Freedom of the media is an inviolable element of democracy.
We want democracy and we want freedom of the media.
We therefore ask you to vote accordingly today.
We know that there are also some Members in your group who agree with us.
We must fight for freedom of the media - in Hungary and elsewhere, too.
(Applause from the left)
Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, as I understand it, the four political groups are not withdrawing their declaration.
We could end the debate here and proceed to the vote, but I understand that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament also wants to make a statement.
Please take the floor.
Mr President, we have been addressed specifically here.
Of course, we have confidence in Commissioner Kroes's work.
Her examination of the secondary law was exemplary.
We wish the Commissioner examining the primary law had done her work in the same way, as this is where the problem lies.
(Applause from the left)
The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate.
Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law.
I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority.
All of these are matters that still need to be discussed.
I would therefore like to state, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that we will not withdraw the motion for a resolution, but rather request that the vote take place.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take a vote on the resolution of the four political groups.

2009 discharge: EU general budget, Section III - Commission (
Interinstitutional agreement on a common Transparency Register - Amendment of the Rules following the establishment of a common Transparency Register
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Carlo Casini, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on a common Transparency Register, and
the report by Carlo Casini, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment by the European Parliament and the Commission of a joint transparency register.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject.
With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered.
I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued.
Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption.
The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises.
Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet.
The right tool for the job is criminal law.
Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union's financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity.
The Transparency Register has a more modest task.
In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about.
This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests.
This is where lobbyists become very useful.
So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders.
Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so.
I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice.
So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge - and therefore also the MEP - maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good.
Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement.
Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded.
The Register is public.
There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions.
They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders.
As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure.
There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency.
Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question.
This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations.
I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action.
I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, transparency is a particularly important principle of democratic institutions.
This is especially true for the European institutions, because - as it is commonly known - they are often accused of exclusion and of non-transparent operation.
The Council is committed to making efforts to ensure the highest level of transparency between the institutions and bodies of the European Union.
The Council is also aware that citizens expect those who they have put in charge of the management of their affairs to observe the highest possible standards; therefore the Council welcomes the initiative of the European Parliament and Council to establish a transparency register.
I especially welcome the reports by Mr Carlo Casini.
If the House accepts them, it will be possible to create the transparency register in the coming months, based on the reports.
By this we can show once again that the EU is committed to transparency not only in words, but also in deeds.
I take this opportunity to emphasise that I am aware that the Council has been invited to participate in the transparency register.
The Council has so far had no intention to fully participate in the process because unlike Parliament and the Commission, the Council by its nature is not affected by the activity of interest representatives.
Generally they do not contact the Council as an institution, but target their activity at the Member States.
Nevertheless, I have already explained that the Council is prepared to participate in the register and to follow its activity.
We are also ready to discuss aspects of the possible role of the Council with Parliament and the Commission, of course without delaying the entry into force of the agreement between these two institutions.
Ladies and gentlemen, based on the Council's recent decision, we are now considering the possibility of making a political declaration for launching the register in June.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, transparency is an issue of interest and concern for citizens and is essential to increase the democratic legitimacy of the European Union.
I am very happy to inform you that already today we have more than 3800 registrants in the Commission register.
Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the adoption of a common transparency register will represent a major further step forward in enhancing transparency in the EU decision-making process and providing a direct response to citizens' concerns.
I would like to praise the very constructive work which we have developed in our joint working group.
Here, I would like to pay tribute to Ms Wallis, our President for today, Mr Casini, our rapporteur, and also to Mr Leinen and Ms Durant.
It was an excellent group and it was a real pleasure to work with together.
The result of our work is a very balanced and pragmatic draft of an interinstitutional agreement, which we are presenting to the House for consideration and debate today.
A positive vote tomorrow will allow the joint launching of the register by our two institutions to take place in June.
This will undoubtedly send a strong political signal confirming our determination to enforce transparent and ethical practices on the European stage.
The register aims to give citizens more transparency as regards organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making or trying to influence the EU decision-making process.
I understand that there have been some concerns about regional public bodies, so I had better clarify.
The question was whether they should register.
I think that if we read the text carefully it is quite true that it would not reflect their true identity and not reflect the fact that they ensure direct representation of their citizens as established by their own constitutional systems.
A careful reading of the content of the agreement should give full reassurances in this regard.
Indeed, the text explicitly mentions that local, regional and municipal authorities are not expected to register.
This approach is even reinforced by Annex I, which indicates that public authorities themselves are not expected to register.
Services forming an integral part of the administration staffed by local, regional and municipal officials and engaged in activities corresponding to institutional or constitutional attributions will also not be expected to register.
I hope this will help to clarify the concerns which I have registered over the last days.
A final word on the interinstitutional dimension.
I think we all share the view that the achievement of common cooperation with the Commission and Parliament would be further consolidated with the involvement of the Council.
Therefore, I am very obliged to, and wholeheartedly thank, the Hungarian Presidency for changing the attitude in the Council and for getting the Council into a positive mood and positive mindset in looking for ways in which we can best arrange the relationship between the Council, Commission and Parliament in managing the register, because the political signal that three institutions are taking this issue so seriously, and that three institutions are going to tackle the issue of transparency together, will be a powerful one.
I am sure that, with such political support from all three institutions, the threshold of 4000 registrants will very soon be reached.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made.
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power.
That is why it is right that our modus operandi should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves.
The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result.
I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests.
I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se.
We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work.
In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently.
I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of.
If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level.
In my country's capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward.
To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register.
Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance.
Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion.
This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground.
This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done.
I would like to address two points.
The first is that the register is not really mandatory.
This needs to be stated openly at this point.
I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist.
Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision?
I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out.
I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory.
As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment.
As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter.
It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, recent scandals have certainly exposed the power that lobbyists can have upon Parliament, so the Liberal Group strongly welcomes the streamlining of the lobbyists' register, which creates effectively a straightforward mandatory system which ought to bring greater transparency and improved consultative processes.
I commend especially paragraph 9 of the report, which invites the Bureau to set up a system of legislative footprints whereby rapporteurs can record those that have lobbied in the course of progressing a draft law.
This is a sensitive question, but I think that it would be a further step forward in improving the popular legitimacy of Parliament and the quality of our law-making.
The system can only be complete once the Council - which is the second chamber of our legislature - joins in, but I welcome the tentative steps forward which are being made and I thank the Presidency for its statement this afternoon.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint.
Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament?
Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be?
Madam President, I think this would be an experiment.
Like all experiments, if it were to be successful, the practice would spread.
However, I think that it ought to be limited to rapporteurs who are responsible for drafting a law on behalf of Parliament.
They should publish the names of people with whom they have had official meetings in the course of their work.
I think it would encourage intelligent and informed lobbying in Parliament.
We all know that we rely on the specialism and expertise of professionals outside this House to produce top class drafting.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, may I start by thanking Mr Casini for his work in delivering this interinstitutional agreement.
Members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission have worked well to develop a meaningful and practical report which will deliver more transparency in the legislative process.
Madam President, it is good that you are in the chair today; I thank you for your work in the negotiations between Parliament and the Commission.
This report is proportional in its approach; it is useful and I believe it will do good.
It recognises the important role that regional and local governments play in shaping European legislation, and therefore clearly differentiates between lobbyists and local and regional government officials.
Although the report is a step in the right direction, there is still more that needs to be done.
I hope that this register - if it proves to be a success - will develop into a mandatory register of lobbyists.
I agree with Mr Duff's proposal that rapporteurs should name the lobbyists that they have had contact with when drafting a law.
There is no doubt that we in this Chamber are regarded with a fair amount of suspicion by our constituents.
The more transparency and the more openness there is the better.
With that in mind, could I just say that the one problem with this agreement is that it is one institution short.
It is disappointing that the Council has not signed up.
As co-legislator, the Member States should come together and sign up to the register so that we can deliver a truly transparent legislative process.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, politics is built on trust.
The Members of this House have been elected in a free and secret ballot by the citizens of our Member States, who rightly expect us to respect their interests, in other words the common good, in all of our speeches and decisions, rather than pursuing our own interests or the interests of third parties, whether businesses or other interest groups.
However, we are also aware that in Brussels, for example, we are surrounded by more than 10 000 professional lobbyists, who do exactly what their job description suggests, namely attempting to exert influence on Members of Parliament and the Commission.
You cannot stop this because it is perfectly normal - we live in a free and open society - however we need to make our voice heard within this structure and maintain our independence.
We have not always succeeded in this and there have been Members who have broken these rules, which is one of the main reasons why we want to improve our rules.
Transparency is one of the most important preconditions for trust and this is precisely what we are working on at present.
After extremely protracted negotiations, we have succeeded in agreeing on this transparency register with the Commission.
Admittedly, I would have preferred it if the Council had also been on board.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have long campaigned for this.
We are pleased that this has been achieved and also quite proud of the result, however I must say that we are not happy with all aspects.
We would have preferred the register to be mandatory, not just for those who work within the Commission and Parliament buildings, but also for those who ply their trade elsewhere, for example over a glass of wine in one of Brussels' many bars.
We want the register not just to apply to Parliament and the Commission, but also to the Council.
We want the financial details made available to be more precise and meaningful.
We believe that the sums of money involved should be measured in the same way, rather than the situation proposed now in which smaller operations are measured in increments of EUR 50 000, while larger ones are measured in larger increments, making it difficult to know exactly how much money is involved.
We also favour regular checks by a common secretariat.
Nonetheless, this is a good day for Europe because it brings us more transparency.
I would like to thank all those involved for what has been achieved.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DA) Madam President, this report is a step in the direction of greater openness and a mandatory lobbyist register for anyone who attempts to influence the EU.
However, there is still a long way to go before we achieve our objective.
Moreover, as corrupt MEPs have revealed, we also need to put our own house in order.
We must make it clear that it is not acceptable for MEPs to have any form of paid job on the side that might put a question mark against our integrity.
Furthermore, we must have effective means of control and rules to determine the consequences of breaking the rules.
We must also establish clear rules for the protection of whistle-blowers, so as to prevent the messenger from being shot.
We look forward to the report from the special committee and, in this regard, we anticipate a speedy revision of the agreement that we are debating here today and of Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)
(DE) Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, I wanted to ask what you think of the approach of the legislative footprint and what it means from your point of view that the transparency register will continue to be non-compulsory, in other words that enormous loopholes will continue to exist.
(DA) Thank you for your question.
It gives me the opportunity to emphasise the point that I have already made, namely that there is still a long way to go before we achieve our objective.
We do not believe that we have already achieved it.
We believe that there is still something lacking.
It is clear that the question of the mandatory nature of the register is absolutely crucial.
We believe that the idea of a digital footprint in legislative texts is a good one and that this is something that we should apply, but of course we also believe that it has to be mandatory in order for it to work.
However, as I said, this is a step in the right direction, and we hope that, when we receive the report from the special committee and this text is to be revised - because it has to be revised within two years - we will have the opportunity to fully achieve our objective, as we must fully achieve our objective in this area.
Madam President, so we are to have a transparency register!
Unsurprisingly, this has only come about because enterprising British journalists were able to demonstrate the ease with which some MEPs succumbed to the lure of money.
At that point, the European Parliament, not unlike the police chief in the film Casablanca, professed itself to be shocked - shocked! - to discover that corrupt lobbying had been taking place under its very nose.
This register bears all the hallmarks of the stable door being shut long after the horse has gone.
The register will change little; the lobbyists will always get through.
A voluntary system of registration was introduced; it was quite ineffectual.
Now some light will shine on what is going on, but most of this will be thrust back into the murky depths of the stagnant pond; it will be business as usual.
As usual, the law-abiding will bear the brunt of the red tape, and wrongdoers will just find a way of carrying on.
While taxpayers' money sloshes around Brussels in the quantities that it does, there will always be unscrupulous lobbyists, just as where there is carrion, there are always vultures.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Mr President, Mr Agnew, while I am all in favour of a well-managed exchange during debates, I am less pleased when matters are presented in a false way.
For that reason, I would ask you to please correct your last statement.
You have just claimed that Parliament is simply debating the question of a transparency register because a number of British newspapers recently brought a particular story to public attention.
I would therefore ask you to explain to Parliament and to the public at large that we began discussing this issue some time ago and that this transparency register had already been agreed upon before the story you are referring to even happened.
Mr President, this appears to be the catalyst which started the whole thing off.
I do not want any British MEPs to be here anyway.
I do not see why we should have to put up with foreign institutions like this running our affairs.
The further we go to the south and east, the worse the culture of corruption becomes.
I do not like it, and I do not want my country to have any part in it.
(DE) Mr President, we are all aware that not just the European Parliament, but also the European Union as a whole is suffering from a huge credibility problem.
I am sure this is something Mr Häfner will not want to hear, however, although Parliament has finally reached agreement on this transparency register, no doubt bowing to pressure because of the recent lobbying scandal, in my opinion, this register will lack teeth.
I believe that a voluntary register is simply a sham and will not offer greater transparency or bring us to a point where the Council of Ministers will be prepared to get involved, so we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board.
Even if the Council were to come on board, a whole host of loopholes would still exist.
Apparently there are hundreds of expert groups who work on the official papers published by the Commission, however the identity of the members of these advisory bodies that meet behind closed doors remains a closely-guarded secret.
In my opinion, we need a record not only of all work undertaken for business or for international concerns, but also all paid lobbying for interest groups such as professional organisations and trade unions.
Our citizens have a right to expect genuine transparency here, too.
(ES) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Casini for the reports on this transparency register.
We are living through a crisis on an extraordinary scale, which has been with us for a long time and threatens to stay even longer.
A crisis like this worsens the public's living conditions and lowers their expectations for the future.
When economic crises prevent us from legitimising politics with the positive results we offer the public, we must contribute to this legitimisation with our scrupulous respect for the political values that we advocate: austerity, honesty, closeness to the public, and transparency.
This register is a step toward transparency, but just a step.
I am with my fellow Members who have stressed the need for this register to be obligatory, for it to incorporate the Council, and for it to include harsher penalties when irregular behaviour is detected.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter.
Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register.
I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass - the list includes public institutions and bodies.
As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register.
In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to.
After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels.
(DE) Mr President, obeying your moral compass can be a tricky business.
I think it is all a matter of the independence of the Members of this House.
Of course lobbying becomes a problem if someone tries to change your convictions, using whatever arguments they can, particularly if these arguments are dishonest.
The fact is that even now the lobby register only covers 2 800 of the 20 000 lobbyists in Brussels.
The fact is also that here in this House we have far too few opportunities to develop sufficiently qualified expertise; this could be changed quickly by redirecting funding and this is something I would very much support.
This transparency register may be just a small victory, however it can be seen as a move in the same direction as Washington D.C., where the Lobbying Act on Disclosure has existed for some time.
This works better than anything we have here.
For my part, I believe that we should not only introduce the concept of a legislative footprint as soon as possible, but also a legislative fingerprint, in other words we should go public on all lobbyists with whom we come in contact and what our business is with them.
I would invite you to take a look at my website, where I have set up a lobby ticker that registers every lobbyist contact, irrespective of whether or not I am currently working on a legislative initiative.
(GA) Mr President, this report is important as it goes to the heart of the work we are doing in Parliament: preparing and implementing rules and laws.
As Mr Cassini said, the term 'lobbyist' is somewhat unfortunate because it creates the impression of privilege or corruption or both, whereas in reality these are experts in their field who help to inform us of the intricacies and the nuances of the various pieces of legislation that we are proposing.
I myself am at this point involved in an opinion on data protection and the number of groups that have come to me with their views amazes me.
I would like, if I were compelled to have a register, to record those who came to me as well, because in that way, we could have true transparency.
A register of lobbyists officially, but also a record of those who lobbied us.
That would create true transparency, greater credibility and ultimately greater trust.
Mr President, it has often been said that our citizens are unaware of the greater powers that this Parliament has had since Lisbon.
This may be true, and it is very unfortunate, because, rest assured, lobbyists - or those pretending to be lobbyists, as proven recently - are very much aware of the powers of this Parliament.
We co-decide on almost all major legislation in the EU, and that is a good thing, because we represent the people of the EU.
We are the only body directly elected by them.
Now, although this is, and will remain, one of the most transparent institutions in the Union, I still believe that with greater power comes greater responsibility, and this is precisely what we must strive to achieve in the months to come.
The agreement today with the Commission is not bad, but lobbyists must be obliged to put their names and their real interests in a register.
And this is what this Parliament is already demanding of lobbyists coming here to us.
I hope that the other institutions will follow suit.
I close by saying the following.
As you mentioned, I am a co-chair of this working group that we have in place.
I cannot say much about what we are discussing in detail.
I can assure you, however, that we will ensure that the rules of conduct for this Parliament will be some of the most transparent and will be rules which can make our citizens and ourselves proud of being members of this extraordinary institution.
- (SK) Mr President, I would like to start by applauding the fact that the submitted agreement will improve the situation in the area of EU transparency, but to be honest, it is still far from ideal.
However, it is good that lobbyists now have a greater incentive to join the register, as otherwise they will not get into the European Parliament.
There is also improved access to information concerning lobbyists, including their names, and we should also applaud the fact that lobbyists who fail to comply with the rules will face various penalties, for example they may be excluded from the register, which will mean they are blacklisted.
The question is whether these measures are enough.
For example, I cannot agree that registration is de facto mandatory when only registered lobbyists have access to Parliament.
In the interests of greater transparency it is essential for registration in fact to be de jure mandatory, and I hope we will achieve this in the current parliamentary term.
We also need to improve the rules on the submission of reports by firms of lobbyists regarding their outlays on lobbying activities.
The current setup allows lobbyists to report far less than they have really spent.
It is equally important to have transparency over the financial sources from which lobbyists and consultancy firms draw their revenue.
I would like to end by adding that I would very much appreciate it if Members would not confuse the topic of the 'transparency register' with that of the 'code of conduct', as it is a completely different issue.
Members who have fallen victim in some way - even if through their own fault - to fictional lobbying agencies, should not be motivated in such a way when establishing the rules of the 'transparency register'.
(SV) Mr President, a great deal has already been said, but it is worth repeating.
It is good that we have now finally agreed on a lobbyists register.
Many of us have been fighting for this for a long time.
However, it is still a very cautious proposal.
I nevertheless choose to see it as a first step that can be developed into a broad principle of public access in all of the EU's institutions.
The comments from the Council and from Commissioner Šefčovič today are very positive.
The principle of disclosure and transparency is one of the few truly effective instruments for minimising the risks of infringements and fraud.
It is also an important way of increasing confidence in those of us operating in this political system and in politics in general.
The next steps should be for all institutions to be included, for the register to be made mandatory and, like the approach taken in some Scandinavian countries, for this to be supplemented by a form of informant protection for whistleblowers, who are also extremely important for openness and transparency.
Thank you.
- (SK) Mr President, I welcome and fully support the establishment of a transparency register and a list of lobbyists intended both for organisations and for the independent lobbyists who participate in the creation and implementation of EU policy, because a tightening up of standards aimed at securing the stability and integrity of EU public administration and strengthening institutional regulations is a guarantee of the democratic functioning of the EU.
On the other hand, the register must not, of course, prevent Members from fulfilling their duties arising from their mandate and meeting their constituents or representatives of public bodies on behalf of Member States at the European Parliament.
There must, however, be clear rules applying to representatives of special interest groups, in order to ensure open, transparent and proper dialogue with those who seek to participate in some way in the creation of EU law and to influence that process.
Mr President, I speak as the rapporteur on the public Access to Documents Regulation No 1049/2001 and, in the spirit of the openness and transparency enshrined within that regulation, I welcome this agreement.
It is another step in the right direction because openness and transparency are at the heart of the democratic decision-making process and we should be made aware of all of those who influence and sometimes have an undue influence on policy, procedures and outcomes.
However, we need to do more work, we need to ensure that the transparency and integrity of the work of lobbyists at the EU level is of the highest.
Furthermore, we need to make the new register operational as quickly as possible and, as soon as the register is operational, all persons and organisations falling into its scope should provide correct, up-to-date information so we can see who is influencing what.
Finally, let me quote Jana Mittermaier of Transparency International: 'The new register will be a test of the commitment of all parties involved in lobbying to greater openness.'
You could not say it more succinctly.
(ES) Mr President, I should like to say that the 21st century is the century of the Web, the century of WikiLeaks and the century of institutional openness.
That means transparency and public participation, and we must be partly responsible for constructing our decisions.
We must decide together.
Our work must therefore be proactive in nature.
We cannot simply wait for lobbies and interest groups to pressure us: we must make the effort to get close to the public; to listen to them.
I therefore believe that the transparency register and fingerprinting algorithms will be effective, and, far from limiting and causing fear, they are an opportunity to improve our reports and gauge our results.
I believe that this is the only way we can move toward becoming a modern parliament.
I have been in charge of one report and in the explanatory statement I listed all the agents with whom I worked, because it is a way of working and an attitude that we should clearly separate from all the irresponsible acts we have seen in the past.
(FR) Mr President, I too would like to express my satisfaction at this text, which I will be pleased to vote for tomorrow.
I would simply like to point out that the recent scandals we have witnessed are attempts at bribery, and nothing else.
While this is a serious matter, these are recent developments.
We began our work long before these recent, serious developments, which are covered in another piece of work.
They are isolated cases, and a good job too.
Nevertheless, we can see that a number of groups are employing considerable resources and are doing all they can to influence decision making as much as possible.
This register is therefore a step in the right direction.
I contributed to its development and I am also extremely satisfied with the work that has been done.
However, further steps must be taken.
This register must become a dynamic instrument and one which is assessed on an annual basis.
It should be anything but rigid.
In fact, I think that developments in technology and in the means employed by lobbyists will force us to continually review the instrument in order to ensure its effectiveness and to identify, through a directive, who is performing lobbying activities, for how much money and in what way.
I am also entirely in favour of ecological footprints - I mean legislative footprints - which publishing the number of lobbyists and the names of the people they met in the reports could provide, and I am in favour of being able to find out exactly who said what and who influenced whom.
Finally, publishing the register is one thing, explaining how it works is quite another.
Citizens also need to be given the means to consult these registers so that they can make meaningful use of the information when trying to understand how we make decisions.
That is why our group will vote unreservedly in favour of this text.
(DE) Mr President, lobbying is a central instrument for the involvement of citizens in political life, which is why it is important to prevent its misuse.
That is why there is an urgent need for a transparency register for all institutions, not just Parliament and the Commission, but also for the Council, after all that is where the real decisions are made.
To restate the point, registration must be mandatory, not just for access to Parliament, after all lobbyists certainly do not just seek out their contacts in the Parliament building itself, but also, more often than not in restaurants, at cocktail receptions or in the gym.
I would also like to say a word about transparency in relation to the political parties.
Even if these are one-man parties and act as a one-man operation, seeking to portray themselves as whiter than white, these parties and persons must demonstrate the requisite level of transparency.
They must ensure transparency in relation to their assets, their claims on the public purse and the reimbursement of campaign costs, in other words in relation to the actual moneys they have received from public bodies in their own countries during their election campaigns.
These costs should be documented in a transparent manner.
(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to take the floor.
In common with the majority of those in this Chamber, I agree that a register will represent progress in terms of the transparency of the legislative procedure, but in my opinion this is only a first step.
We should give serious consideration to other steps and solutions.
As I see it, what is most important is the question of what MEPs are allowed to do.
Are MEPs only allowed to work in a professional capacity here in Parliament, or are they also allowed to undertake other activities in addition to their work in Parliament?
I personally believe that these other activities should be very narrowly defined, and should be limited to scientific work and publications.
Any other activities on various boards will always provoke questions and doubts.
(SV) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has granted increased powers to the European Parliament and with this also comes an increase in responsibility.
Transparency in our work is therefore extremely important in view of the fact that our work involves legislation for 500 million people and often very large sums of money.
The register for lobbyists that has now been decided on in the compromise is, of course, very worthwhile, and I hope that we can go further by providing informant protection for whistleblowers.
I also hope that we can go further and ensure that the information in the register for financial contingent liabilities or ownership becomes mandatory rather than voluntary, as it is at the moment.
I hope, too, that we will have a debate on what subsidiary activities are appropriate from an ethical point of view when we have a job to do as Members of the European Parliament.
I welcome the compromise and see it as a way forward, but there are many more steps to take on this road to transparency, openness and greater democratic trust.
Thank you.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think Mr Weber rightly said that the transparency register being jointly managed is something to be proud of because, with the exception of the United States or Canada, I do not know of any other place outside the European Union where such a lobbies' register with such parameters as we are going to establish is functioning.
Here I am also referring to Member State capitals.
The question that was raised by several speakers, the first being Mr Groote and then Mr Häfner, concerned the mandatory register.
We, in the working group, are discussing this issue at great length.
The problem is that currently we do not see the legal basis that allows us to oblige companies, citizens or interest representatives to register in order to exercise their profession.
We, as an EU administration, cannot refuse to deal with such an entity or entities on this basis.
Therefore we have been looking for ways in which we can turn to the positive motivation of companies, organisations and lobbies to register.
I think we achieved a lot because, with the agreement of Parliament, we are actually turning this system into a mandatory one. With our joint actions, together with the Council, we will increase the reputation and pressure so much that we will see in the next two years how this is to work and it will give us additional experience to have a high-quality review and we will see how we can improve the working of the system further.
The calls for appropriate verification as regards financing the activities of those who register: here I can assure you that the Commission is already performing random checks on all the registrants that are already in the register and I am sure that these activities will even increase once we manage the register jointly.
All those who are in the register should be sure that if there is something inappropriate we will find it, we will criticise it, try to correct it and we will not be afraid to shame those responsible.
I was very glad - I am coming back to this because several speakers referred to the importance it - that all three institutions are progressing in this work.
I am sure that after this very important opening by the Hungarian Presidency, we will not waste a minute and we will try to start the interinstitutional talks with the Council as soon as possible so we can find, I am sure, a very accommodating manner in which to manage the register together, the three institutions working on this issue with the same goal of increased transparency of European Union legislation.
The last point that was raised by several speakers and described by Mr Casini: the transparency register is definitely not a silver bullet or a magical solution to fight corruption.
We know very well that high moral standards, ethics, dignity and clear rules are key.
But it would certainly serve as a very good instrument and good indicator that those who register are prepared to respect the rules and be transparent, that they have nothing to hide and - this should be the key indicator for all of us - that they should be real partners to work with us and exchange information with us and that they have trust in our future communication.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to welcome, as a representative of a Member State which has had an act providing for lobbying since 2006, today's debate and the fact that Parliament and the Commission are able to agree in the issue of the transparency register.
Transparency has always been a very important issue for the Council.
I am very happy to see that while we did not manage to achieve progress in 2008 and 2009, we now made a breakthrough during the Hungarian Presidency in that the Council is prepared to monitor processes, and inasmuch as it is able, will participate in this activity - we will see to what extent, negotiations are still to follow.
So we are ready for negotiations concerning our contribution and, as I indicated in my introductory speech, we think that we would affirm this intention in a political declaration to be issued in June.
So this does not mean that we would accede to the interinstitutional agreement.
The reason why Member States can accept this formula at the moment - which, I must emphasise once again, is a significant progress compared to the previous years - is that lobby organisations do not approach the Council as a European institution, there have been very sporadic examples for that.
The targets of lobbying activities are rather the Member States, the governments of Member States, and governmental agencies.
So the Council is not exposed to lobbying to the extent the Commission or the European Parliament is.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope cooperation will be efficient, and we will be able to make this political declaration after these negotiations.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things.
I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists.
Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media.
For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists.
This is not true.
It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe.
The agreement had been reached long beforehand.
If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement.
The text has, however, remained the unchanged.
That is the first clarification.
The second concerns the question of obligation.
The register is already mandatory.
Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register.
I cannot understand what 'obligatory' means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register.
That is not possible.
If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact.
The third point refers to possible future amendments.
There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible.
I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President.
We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations.
Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case.
If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government - the Commission - and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states.
Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states.
I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011.
Written statements (Rule 149)
, in writing. - We always pride ourselves on being the most open among the European institutions.
However, the recent past has demonstrated that, no matter the advantages this provides, the system has its drawbacks, too.
We all know how European citizens have lost and keep losing their confidence in Europe and, let us be honest, in us MEPs.
An important way of regaining this trust is being open about what we do and what influences shape our work.
The joint transparency register that we are to adopt today by voting yes to the two reports on the table is a great first step in this direction.
It is a 'first step' as this will not solve all our problems.
Even if it would be difficult to do it now, in the future we shall move towards mandatory registration for lobbyists.
I would also like to underline that such a register does not replace our individual efforts for transparency and the need for rethinking our work in this regard.
I welcome the common transparency register of the Commission and the European Parliament, at least in this form.
However, it should be just one of a series of essential steps towards greater transparency in the legislative process, which should apply to all three European institutions.
The European Parliament is clearly willing to hold a serious debate on lobbying and the rules for lobbying.
This will also set an example to those Member States that have yet to take such a step.
I believe that the transparency register will also contribute towards the greater credibility of the political environment.
Its actual impact, however, will depend mainly on the willingness of everyone involved to respect the more stringent rules.
, in writing. - (NL) I can only applaud the fact that the Commission and Parliament are pulling together to create a common 'transparency register' for lobbyists, think tanks and other interest organisations.
After all, for every dossier on our agenda, we need to be able to make enquiries of various interest groups and to do so completely openly.
There is nothing wrong, by the way, with organisations defending their own interests, as long as this takes place in an open and balanced fashion.
The principle of 'legislative footprint', whereby rapporteurs have to state with whom they have been in contact in the process of drafting their proposals, is a good policy.
I have actually already addressed this in my report on toy safety.
Clear arrangements to make this principle generally applicable will enhance transparency.
This is also a suitable instrument to bust the myths about lobbying which are circulating amongst the general public, whose common interest we, as members of the European Parliament, are promoting.
The fact that the Council, also, eventually expressed its willingness to join this register means that we are going to have a unique register for all EU lobbyists, which is something that we, together with the European Parliament, have been working towards for years.
I therefore support this approach.

(PL) Mr President, in this amendment, the PPE Group would like the word 'strongly' to be removed from paragraph 2.
I hope there are no objections.
Opening of the sitting
1.
Sri Lanka: follow-up of the UN report (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka.
author. - Mr President, in the brutal war of the Sri Lanka Government against the Tamil minority, at least 40 000 Tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps.
The UN report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the Tamil people.
Unfortunately, there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of Tamils in Sri Lanka.
The day after its publication, it was reported that the UN Secretary-General would only launch an international investigation if the Sri Lankan Government agrees or an international forum such as the UN Foreign Security Council calls for an inquiry.
Given the nature of the Sri Lankan Government, it is obvious that it will not allow any international investigation.
It highlights once again the need to campaign for a genuinely independent inquiry into the war crimes and for the Rajapaksa regime to be held responsible.
On 18 May, there will be protests around the world organised by many groups, including the Tamil Solidarity Campaign, to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war.
A united struggle of Sinhalese and Tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the Tamil-speaking people.
author. - Mr President, we only have to hear those opening remarks to understand why I very much regret that we are having this debate today.
It is being promoted by extremist elements in the Tamil diaspora, the same people who have helped sustain the LTTE terrorist campaign over many years through political activity, and often from the proceeds of crime.
Of course, the final stages of the LTTE campaign were awful.
The UN's Darusman report, which is the immediate pretext for this debate, states clearly that in those final stages, the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields, intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians, including children, into its ranks, executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals.
This does not excuse the shelling of civilian targets, but it does put it into context and shows where the blame lies.
Instead of trying to bring together the peoples of Sri Lanka, there are those who seek to continue a campaign of hatred and division.
They see this Darusman report as a weapon in this campaign, and just want to put the Sri Lankan Government in the dock.
This approach is malicious and counter-productive.
The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations.
Let us do all that we can to support them and the peoples of Sri Lanka, instead of attacking them.
Mr President, from the very first words, you have all understood that the debate would be quite lively and that there would be two views.
I should say that my group aligns itself neither with one side nor with the other, but simply with the side of justice and of reconciliation.
I believe that there can be no reconciliation, in those countries, like Sri Lanka, but there are certainly many others, which have experienced atrocious wars, unless justice is done.
Well, what does this United Nations report to which Mr Van Orden refers do?
It simply restates the facts and calls for there to be a mechanism for international justice, which one knows must be approved by the government.
That is the very least.
How would you like there to be reconciliation of a people?
It is on both sides, Mr Van Orden.
It is not only on the Tamil side.
There have been crimes on both sides.
Both sides are responsible.
It is by both sides that justice must be done.
The report also states, and I apologise for this, that the reconciliation commission that has just been mentioned did not have an investigative element of a sufficiently high standard.
Finally, I fear that a national organ of justice will not finally result in a clarification of the facts.
That is why, quite simply and in the name of all those who have suffered on both sides, I say that this House can only support this report in order to shed more light and have more justice.
That is the only message that I should like to pass on today.
I shall not have used up all my allotted time, but that is the essential message for this House.
Mr President, in February, I went to Sri Lanka with the Delegation for Relations with South Asia.
Whilst there, we witnessed the enormous efforts to overcome the consequences of a 25-year civil war.
The European Union, the United Nations and NGOs are providing help, from the clearing of landmines by the HALO Trust through to the resettlement of the Tamils in their former home.
We call on the government there to respond positively to the recommendations of the UN's panel of experts, which highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity on the parts of both the Sinhalese and the LTTE.
It is encouraging that the government has set up a commission to deal with reconciliation, establish legal jurisdiction, solve language problems and deal with former front-line soldiers.
The consistent willingness to cooperate, the will to integrate minorities and the assurance of maintaining international legal norms form the basis for the development of a country that, without violence and terror, has a real future.
We emphatically call on the EU's High Representative to support efforts of this kind.
author. - Mr President, the conflict in Sri Lanka may be over, but many questions remain unanswered.
An end to a conflict does not necessarily mean that the conflict is over in people's minds.
Victory is not the same as peace.
It takes time, effort and especially commitment and strong will to overcome the scars of a conflict.
Reconciliation is imperative.
Justice is vital for a new beginning.
Therefore, the Sri Lankan Government should immediately start investigations on the violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.
Both sides need to be investigated.
International conventions to which Sri Lanka is a party require investigations on the alleged violations and the prosecution of those who are responsible.
Only by means of an open and honest investigation and through justice can the Sri Lankan people heal the wounds of a long and difficult conflict and continue their lives in peace.
The ALDE Group applauds UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's report and initiative on Sri Lanka.
We fully support the UN recommendations.
author. - Mr President, on 23 May 2009, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the President of Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa, signed a joint statement in which Sri Lanka agreed to guarantee accountability for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war which ended in May 2009.
After this agreement was not honoured by the Sri Lankan Government, the UN Secretary-General appointed a panel of experts to advise him on modalities for an accountability process.
The report, which was published very recently, made credible allegations that both government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam failed to respect the norms of international law.
The report stressed the need for accountability on both sides.
The Sri Lankan Government has dismissed the panel's report, calling it illegal and biased.
I believe that it is an objective reason for further investigations.
At a time when the creditable and legitimate work of international human rights bodies is being discredited, it is for this House to step up and defend international law.
War crimes must never go unpunished, no matter where they occur.
Mr President, the civil war in Sri Lanka lasted 25 years and ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers.
The last stages of the war were especially bloody and thousands died in its last few months.
According to the new report by the UN, it is very likely that the Tamil Tigers and government troops will be found guilty of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights committed in the final stages of the conflict.
The Tamil Tigers are suspected of shooting civilians trying to flee.
The government killed civilians in shellfire.
These are both serious crimes and they cannot be ignored.
That is why it is important that the UN can carry out an impartial and open investigation into the matter.
Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan Government has been unwilling to allow the investigation to go ahead without its approval, unless the UN Member States unanimously insist.
It is extremely important that Sri Lanka adopts a constructive attitude and is willing to cooperate.
A sense of responsibility is vital for the reconciliation process.
The EU must support efforts to strengthen Sri Lanka's sense of responsibility.
The conclusions of the Darusman report for the United Nations (UN) point to the massacre of tens of thousands of civilians, war crimes and crimes against humanity, alongside other terrible humanitarian law violations, committed by both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan Government.
Carrying out an independent investigation and bringing those responsible to justice is not a political choice but an obligation under international law.
The Reconciliation Commission established by the government does not meet basic requirements for independence.
Therefore, the international community - specifically the European Union and the UN Security Council - must offer their unconditional support for the report's recommendations and take urgent steps towards the creation of an independent international mechanism to monitor the Sri Lankan Government's actions, ensure that crimes committed on both sides are investigated, and seek justice for the Sri Lankan people.
Mr President, I wish to support this resolution on human rights violations and war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.
It is crucial, in addition to expressing our solidarity with the victims and condemning the violence, and given the concerns regarding the judiciary's lack of independence, to promote a serious, impartial, transparent investigation to be undertaken by an independent body so that the people responsible on both sides of the conflict can be identified and punished.
Impunity for war crimes must end if we want to prevent them from being repeated in the future.
In Sri Lanka, the civilian population was bombed, among other atrocities.
Seventy-four years ago in my own country, Franco's troops bombed the town of Guernica, killing more than half of the population, an episode famously depicted by Picasso.
Ever since, Guernica has been a universal symbol for peace and resistance.
However, it is everyone's wish to make progress towards reconciliation.
We must therefore encourage, help and also push the Sri Lankan Government to continue these prosecutions so that true peace and justice can be attained.
Mr President, the United Nations report, published on 11 April, throws light on the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed in Sri Lanka in the conflict between the government forces of Mr Rajapaksa and the Tamil Tiger independence movement.
The clashes in May and June 2009 gave rise to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and thousands of civilians lost their lives.
We cannot accept the impunity of those responsible and of the authors of these crimes.
The government of Mr Rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the UN report and it even contests its conclusions.
In Sri Lanka, the press is muzzled, and journalists are subject to intimidation and arbitrary detention.
The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations.
The Tamil minority is the victim of a genocide that dare not speak its name.
We must urgently send European Parliament observers to the north of Sri Lanka to see what is really happening there and reassert the principle of the self-determination of peoples.
(The speaker agreed to take two blue card questions under Rule 149(8))
Mr President: I heard it directly in French and the word used was 'génocide', which means 'genocide', and that has a particular significance in international law.
If such were the intent of the Sri Lankan Government, how come they have just released 200 000 Tamils who were prisoners?
It is absurd to accuse the Sri Lankan Government of genocide.
I would hope that the Member would retract that statement.
(FR) Mr Tannock, I used that word by way of a metaphor, above all, to label the phenomenon.
However, I have made it clear that it was not the name.
The facts have to be established.
In any case, what is happening to the Tamil minority cannot be shrugged off as a simply anodyne act.
Mr President, the previous speaker mentioned that she is calling for some sort of commission to go to Sri Lanka to look at what is going on on the ground there.
Could I just remind her that the South Asia delegation has just been to Sri Lanka - and I see several members of that delegation in the Chamber.
Indeed, my colleague, Mr Mann, referred to the visit there: the previous speaker is obviously not listening to what is going on in this debate.
People have been to Sri Lanka.
They know Sri Lanka and they know what is going on.
I do not know where Ms Delli is getting all this nonsense from.
(FR) You are right, we have already sent a mission and I acknowledge the formidable character of that mission, seeing that you worked on it.
However, we can also exert pressure, which means that we must absolutely repeat this type of operation.
Mr President, Sri Lanka is a ravaged land.
The civil war officially ended nearly two years ago, and we know in what conditions it took place.
In that country, the United Nations failed badly.
The reports from non-governmental organisations are damning.
Thousands of civilians were killed between January and May 2009.
Atrocities were committed by both camps, but it seems to be accepted that the pro-government forces knowingly shelled zones where they had encouraged the civilian population to take refuge.
Since that time, the Sri Lankan Government has been manoeuvring to exonerate itself and impede access to justice by those who must be called, at the very least, victims of war crimes.
It has not ceased to try and underestimate the number of civilians present in the war zone while it has even deprived them of all humanitarian aid, including food, water and healthcare.
The Tamil Tigers have their share of the responsibility for these horrors.
They conscripted child soldiers and used the civilian population as a human shield, but that does not in any way alleviate the responsibility of the governmental authorities on the spot.
It justifies nothing.
The UN waited for a long time before denouncing the situation in that country.
What is worse, the Sri Lankan Government has multiplied its machinations to prevent the publication of the latest report in particular and to have its conclusions rejected.
We can only welcome the report of 11 April.
The resolution before us today is going in the right direction.
For my part, I should have liked it to go even further.
It is high time that international justice did its work, in Sri Lanka as elsewhere.
Mr President, the long-running military conflict between the government forces and the armed groups of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has had very cruel consequences for the civilian population living in the conflict zones, came to an end in 2009.
After the end of the war, the Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, promised to investigate all suspected violations of military law and international humanitarian law during the military conflict.
The UN report published in April this year states that both sides in the conflict carried out military operations without taking steps to protect the rights and lives of civilians.
Despite this, the responsible bodies in Sri Lanka have not held to account the people responsible for serious violations of humanitarian law, two years after the end of the war.
The judicial authorities are, in many cases, inactive, and we therefore need to support through our resolution UN efforts to uphold the law and establish accountability for the killing and torture of thousands of civilians during the vicious fighting between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and government forces in Sri Lanka.
(PL) Mr President, the dramatic events in Sri Lanka which are described in the UN report show what kind of problems can be caused by armed conflict.
What took place there is further proof that solving differences by violence and force of arms generates other colossal problems.
In Europe, there has, for centuries, been reflection about the concept of a just war.
What is particularly painful is the fact that in the modern world, even a war which is theoretically just inevitably entails the suffering of innocent and unjustified victims.
This happens irrespective of how we define a just war.
In the case of Sri Lanka, growing amounts of data show that the war was not a just one for either side.
The victor is not always right, although they always try to prove they are right.
If there is really to be a reconciliation, as the Sri Lankan Government has declared, then the basis of such a reconciliation must be the truth about what happened during the struggle with the Tamil Tigers.
There will be no genuine reconciliation without exposing the war crimes which were committed, irrespective of which side it was that committed them.
There will be no reconciliation if the sides consider their own sins to be taboo and do not allow them to be mentioned.
Mr President, many in this Chamber have been involved in the politics of Sri Lanka, and indeed the politics of the diaspora of Sri Lanka and of the Tamil community.
What we are discussing today is a report by the Secretary-General's panel of experts on accountability in Sri Lanka.
I have not heard anyone in the Chamber as yet cast doubts on the intrinsic integrity of that report.
I have read the report and I have spoken to many about the report on both sides.
If we are saying that we should leave the report on the table, and we should not have investigations into what happened between January and May, and indeed not open the door to investigate many allegations on both sides, what is the point of a report of this nature?
Indeed, I find it compelling that one diaspora organisation of the Tamil community, the Global Tamil Forum, has said that credible allegations against the LTTE - and they have made this very prominent - should also be investigated.
We have a report which ought to have a follow-up, and I speak firmly in favour of the need for a genuine process of accountability which would bring truth, justice and reconciliation to Sri Lanka following what will be a painful investigation, but an investigation which must happen.
Mr President, it is appalling that during the protracted military conflict in Sri Lanka that ended in 2009, nearly 100 000 people were killed, including tens of thousands of civilians, most of whom died in the final phase of the conflict.
The international community should demand a robust international investigation into credible reports of atrocities committed on both sides.
It is a pity that countries like China and Russia opposed discussion of the issue in the United Nations Security Council and the UN Secretary-General taking more robust action to investigate the crimes committed.
The UN Panel of Experts clearly indicated that both the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil rebels committed serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, possibly amounting in some cases to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
So I fully support the immediate establishment of an international justice mechanism as proposed by the UN report.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, it is apparent from the UN report that in the final bloody months of the civil war in Sri Lanka, which went on for 25 years, thousands of civilians died in artillery fire from government troops.
The UN also said that Tamil rebels had used more than 300 000 civilians as human shields and shot civilians trying to escape.
Both sides therefore seriously contravened human rights and international laws in a war situation.
It is important now that reconciliation talks get under way, so that an impartial and independent investigation into war crimes can be carried out by the UN.
Parliament's resolution is wellbalanced in its wording and will encourage the parties to achieve reconciliation and build peace.
(RO) Mr President, the conclusions from the UN report published on 25 April 2011 level serious accusations concerning the numerous violations of human rights and norms of international law, both by the Sri Lankan Government and by the rebel forces defeated in the civil conflict which lasted well over 28 years.
Indeed, the report states that government forces killed tens of thousands of civilians by bombing populated areas, hospitals and even humanitarian aid centres belonging to the UN.
On the other hand, the rebel forces used numerous civilians as human shields, with those who tried to escape the conflict zone being shot on the spot.
Like other speakers before me, I think that an independent international mechanism needs to be created to investigate the war crimes in this country, as well as the other serious human rights violations.
An impartial, transparent investigation is required, which will shed light on who is responsible for these crimes that have shocked the international community.
Mr President, this well-researched report shows us - in addition to all its conclusions - that, once again, the first casualty of war is truth.
What it fails to do is to outline the policies needed to heal the hurts of that nation.
Too many countries for too long turned a blind eye to what was going on.
The right policies are needed now, through a concerted effort by the international community, to seek release and justice for all of those who have been so terribly affected.
Mr President, Mr Watson is quite right in saying that the first casualty of any war, and specifically this one, is truth.
Obviously, we also have to admit that the civilian population is a victim in this kind of conflict, and the UN panel has shown clearly that there are responsibilities on both sides: mainly that of the government but also that of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and both need to be investigated.
What we are saying is that a proper inquiry is very unlikely if the investigating commission comes from the government.
What we are asking for is an independent commission to investigate these allegations, identified by the UN panel, of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
If we do not understand the need for this, we will not have a solution, because peace will come only when justice arrives; justice is possible only on the basis of truth; and truth will come only if we have an independent investigation.
Mr President, finally, Sri Lanka is enjoying peace after a quarter of a century of terrorist insurgency, and the UN report on the Sri Lankan army's defeat of the Tamil Tigers is heavy on criticism and light on substantive, proven facts.
The approach taken in the report seems to be undermining the efforts now undertaken by the government of Sri Lanka to promote truth and understanding, not least through the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and the government actually having released more than 200 000 detained Tamil prisoners.
Of course, any deliberate atrocities against civilians by the military must be punished.
I agree with that, but there is no clear evidence that this was deliberate government policy.
I would like to remind the House that the LTTE refused a supervised international surrender offer and preferred instead to choose a bloodbath as their kind of exit strategy, which was appalling.
The consequences now of the international community's ambivalence towards Sri Lanka are clear: a loss of influence and an inability to shape developments.
Meanwhile, China has stepped into the breach and become Sri Lanka's closest friend and defender at the UN.
I hardly need remind colleagues here of China's approach to human rights.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on 25 April 2011, the United Nations made public the advisory report of the panel of experts appointed by the UN Secretary-General on accountability in relation to the armed conflict in Sri Lanka.
The panel found credible allegations which, if proven, would indicate that serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The panel also makes a series of recommendations to the UN Secretary-General and to the government of Sri Lanka which, in the panel's words, will serve as the framework for an ongoing and constructive engagement between the Secretary-General and the government of Sri Lanka on accountability.
Recommendations include the launch of genuine investigations by the government of Sri Lanka and the establishment of an independent international mechanism by the UN Secretary-General.
The UN has stated that the UN Secretary-General is carefully reviewing the reports, conclusions and recommendations, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged the Sri Lankan Government to quickly carry out the measures suggested by the panel and ensure justice.
The government of Sri Lanka, on its side, has rejected the report in the strongest terms.
Earlier this week, High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a declaration on behalf of the EU reiterating the EU view that an independent process to address these extremely serious allegations should contribute to strengthening the process of reconciliation and ensuring lasting peace and security in Sri Lanka.
The High Representative has stressed that the issue of accountability should be seen as an essential part of the process of national reconciliation.
The EU therefore hopes that the government of Sri Lanka will recognise the constructive objectives of the report, and encourages it to engage with the UN Secretary-General on its contents.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in May 2009 and resulted in more than 90 000 deaths.
Numerous Sri Lankans who had been displaced by the violence in their country have returned to their homes following the end of hostilities.
However, there are still 75 000 refugees who continue to lead difficult lives in camps in Tamil Nadu, India.
Sri Lanka has a double challenge to overcome.
It has to recover from a long-lasting crisis.
The United Nations' experts' report, made public on 25 April, found the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights credible.
In the interests of justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, it is essential to set up an impartial, transparent and independent enquiry.
It also has to prepare for the various natural disasters, such as flooding, landslides, cyclones and also drought, to which the country is exposed.

I should like to welcome the representative of the United Nations.
A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate)
We now continue with the debate on the report by Salvador Garriga Polledo on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe.
(FR) Mr President, the report by Mr Garriga Polledo, and I thank him and congratulate him on his work, is an ambitious summary that looks to the future.
Indeed, his report calls for greater resources so that the Union can better implement its objectives as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It forcefully raises the question of own resources and therefore, indeed, the issue of whether our institution enjoys freedom in its fundamental political act, that of voting on its budget.
It proposes extending and expanding common policies, in particular, cohesion policy which has made a major contribution in the past to making the European Union a model of cooperation and understanding between peoples, and may continue to do so in the future.
With the future Multiannual Financial Framework, if we listen to the European Parliament, cohesion policy will be able to move into a new phase thanks to the creation of intermediate regions.
Thus, we propose a new package for this fund which strengthens equal opportunities between all our European territories, regardless of their past in economic terms, regardless of their handicaps when compared with more developed regions and regardless of how vulnerable they may be to the economic crisis that we are experiencing at present or any crisis that we may have to face in the future.
Cohesion among the different territories of the European Union is a key, strategic objective on which the very future of Europe depends.
The proposals that have been made are a step in the right direction, and if they are acted upon, lay sound foundations for the future.
Mr President, the vote on the report by Mr Garriga will be a simple choice: choosing a Europe that is moving forward, a vote by people who, leaving aside their political affiliations, believe in the future of Europe.
(PT) Mr President, at this time of serious economic crisis in the euro area, resulting from neoliberal policies, and from a lack of solidarity and economic and social cohesion, it is unacceptable that a break with and change in the policies of the European Union and its financial resources is not being advocated.
When experiencing an economic and social crisis, one of the most significant challenges we face is finding a new Multiannual Financial Framework in which the Union budget for economic and social cohesion is significantly increased, whilst obligatory national contributions are reduced to, at most, 10% of the project on the table, particularly for the countries with the greatest financial difficulties; a framework in which there is a commitment to investment, to public services, to support for production, to the creation of jobs with rights, and to the eradication of poverty, social inequalities and all types of discrimination, particularly on the basis of gender.
There is also a need to promote peace, cooperation and development aid, and to significantly cut spending on the military and overseas representation.
For all these reasons, we consider this report a long way from what is needed for a better, fairer future for Europe and its citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I take the chair for this sitting, all of you will understand if I express to you my sorrow and consternation at the death of Jorge Semprún, which took place a few hours ago, at the age of 87.
In Jorge Semprún, we celebrate someone who was imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration and extermination camp, someone who fought Nazi forces in France and the Franco dictatorship in my country, Spain.
We also celebrate the outstanding, politically-committed writer, who collaborated, in particular, on our European Book Prize programme, and the reassured pro-European politician.
I mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and I am going to ask President Buzek to send his family and the Spanish Government a message of heartfelt condolence and support, which I am sure that all of us here share.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, there is no doubt that we are facing one of the most critical moments in the economic history of the European Union.
For this very reason, the committee that we have managed to establish during the course of this year certainly has a fundamental role.
We have no preconceived ideas against increasing the budget, although we think we do need to investigate where cuts can be made.
It is clear that we need to cut the European budget because, unfortunately, sometimes European funds are not used properly.
Indeed, perhaps it is precisely because of the way that these funds are used that many European citizens are no longer so convinced that the European Union is worthwhile.
To cite an example, we would call your attention to the various funds channelled towards the enlargement policy - sometimes we do not know where they end up.
What is there to say about the incalculable amounts spent on integration and which have achieved so little?
There are also some virtuous regions that do not access the funds, which are then granted to other regions that either fail to use them, or use them poorly or for not entirely legitimate ends.
We would ask for maximum focus on this whole issue and for steps to be taken so that Europe can recover its credibility, including through rigorous measures.
(NL) Mr President, obviously, I will have to confine myself to a couple of essential comments.
First of all, despite its bulk, I cannot find anywhere in this report a single serious attempt to make proposals for structural savings, for example, the abolition of what, in my view, are totally superfluous European institutions, such as the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and a good few European agencies of all kinds.
Nor, indeed, has any attempt whatsoever been made to ask the question of whether Europe would not be wiser to confine itself to a number of carefully defined core tasks.
On the contrary.
Secondly, I absolutely shudder at the repeated suggestions that the EU should impose its own taxes or that it should issue European government bonds, which will sooner or later have to be paid back by somebody.
The suggestion in this report that measures of this kind would not increase the total tax burden on the citizens is a lie, of course, and a deception of the worst sort.
Besides, this would further undermine the last vestige of supervision and control that the Member States are exercising on the European institutions' spending diarrhoea.
Those are the basic reasons why I cannot possibly support this report.
(RO) Mr President, the current challenges which the European Union is faced with require a firm, sustained EU-level response.
The response to these challenges is the 2020 strategy, an instrument created to bring recovery and strength to Europe.
The report presented today places the 2020 strategy at the heart of the next MFF being drafted, together with the new situation created by the areas of competence and policies stipulated by the Treaty of Lisbon.
At a time when many Member States are faced with difficult fiscal adjustments, the EU budget, 95% of which is used for investment, must provide a very high level of European added value.
The report calls for the continuation of two extremely important European policies - the common agricultural and cohesion policies - at least at their current level.
The allocation of resources under these policies must be based on new criteria which will ensure the proper use of resources to achieve maximum efficiency and compliance with convergence and cohesion criteria.
The transport and energy policies must be enhanced.
Allocation of funding to research and development, at both European and national level, must ensure the progress of all European policies.
The seven-year period, the new structure proposed and greater flexibility provide additional security in implementing and adapting to changing priorities.
For the sake of stability, the EU budget's system of resources needs to be rethought so as to replace current national contributions with European resources.
The European Council recently adopted ambitious targets for the EU's development.
This same Council must accept that the 5% budget increase being proposed by the report is the minimum condition for achieving these targets.
The forthcoming MFF must be implemented with an economic governance system in place which can ensure the financial stability required to implement European policies.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Salvador Garriga.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to start my speech by praising the work of the rapporteur and all the members of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE Committee).
Above all, I must praise their determination over the past year of work to achieve a majority agreement and majority support in Parliament for a report such as the one we are presenting today.
This report is the road map that the European Union must follow if we want to meet the political, economic and social objectives we have set ourselves, and also if we want to overcome the challenges we are going to face in the coming years.
This is the script we must follow in order to emerge from the crisis, and to ensure that our growth is intelligent, sustainable and integrated, as set forth in the Europe 2020 strategy.
If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
That is why we warn in this report that without sufficient resources, we will not be able to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves.
We know that some members of the Council do not agree with increasing the budget - we have seen as much here.
They were not in favour in economic boom times either.
Now they say it is because of the crisis, but they wanted cuts when the current financial perspective was negotiated too.
That is why we are asking the Council, if it does not agree with this budget increase, to tell us which objectives it does not want to be met.
In this report, we do not only set out the policies we want to achieve.
We also show how to finance them and we put forward a discussion on own resources.
This discussion, designed to bring to an end the false debate of the net contributors, seeks funding without hand outs, funding without exceptions, funding that is fair.
We have put forward various options for doing this, but I have a preference for one of them, and Commissioner Lewandowski knows very well which one it is: it is the tax on financial transactions or, as it is known in many of our countries, the Robin Hood tax.
This tax would make it possible to raise between EUR 200 billion and EUR 300 billion.
It is a tax that penalises speculators and would force all those who have profited by gambling with our money to pay up.
It is a tax that would increase transparency and reduce financial speculation and, above all, a tax that would not affect citizens, because it would force those directly responsible for the crisis to pay for their excesses.
We are really only asking you for one thing: to set your sights higher.
We ask you to set your sights higher to ensure that the European project continues on track and does not become stalled, because that would cost us our future.
(DE) Mr President, I was born into the European Union in 1975 and it has shaped my political life ever since.
That is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter.
When there is talk of increases, then discussions must lead to a consideration of the correct use of resources.
Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form.
The agricultural and structural budgets are left untouched.
However, more money is being sought for research and development.
The only response that occurs to the House and to the report is more money, although there is no clear indication where this money is to come from.
We hear talk of the Union's 'own resources', but there has been no definition of what these resources actually are.
If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.
The future viability of the EU should not be measured in terms of decimal places.
To this extent, I am more than a little disappointed by the present report.
Mr President, this morning, Mr Daul came running to speak here in the plenary on the need for a bigger EU budget, but he was running so fast that he was running out of breath and had to stop speaking.
This reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget.
The EU budget is fixed at about 1% of EU GDP; the Commission and Parliament say, 'that is not enough, we want more money'.
Yet the EU is unable to spend the money available; billions of euro in regional cohesion funds remain unspent.
Some money has to be returned to Member States.
So why do you need more money if you cannot spend the money you have?
But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of 'Pavlovs': Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now - they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity, for example, by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States, saving 30% of those funds, and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies.
But I am sure that the EU Pavlovs will yet again run into the brick wall of the EU Council later this year.
(FR) Mr President, as has already been said, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, some similar, some different, but in all cases exacerbated by the crisis, national budgets are struggling.
In each of our countries, no matter what majority is in government, the budgetary situation needs to be addressed.
We have two options.
One is to all act alone, trying to reconcile spending and income, in some cases, according to what I have heard, worshiping austerity as an ends in its own right, making swingeing cuts to public spending and social benefits, thereby exacerbating the situation for citizens.
I would plead in favour of the second option, namely pooling our budgetary efforts, making budgetary solidarity work, playing the own resources card, not least through a tax on financial transactions.
That is the purpose of the budgetary complementarity that we want to achieve through this convention-style conference, a proposal that we made to the Council during the conciliation procedure and that we have reiterated in this report.
We need to work together - the European Union, national parliaments and governments - to find a way of pooling our spending and budgetary approaches.
We cannot have our cake and eat it: we cannot make cuts and, at the same time, invest in infrastructure.
It is not possible to contribute less but receive more.
I think that this convention-style model of dialogue between governments, the European Union, national parliaments and the European Parliament is the right way to rebuild confidence in Europe, both now and in the longer term.
(NL) Mr President, this is a very bad report and one which deserves to be thrown in the bin straight away.
Right now, when people everywhere are facing incredibly painful austerity measures, it is too insane for words that we in the European Union should be proposing to spend even more money.
To think that we are behaving in that way when things could be so different: no more throwing money around, no funding for cycle paths and crêperies in a country like the Netherlands.
We should concentrate our Structural Funds on the poorest countries and only on innovative projects of pan-European significance in the rest of the Member States.
According to the report, everything should remain as it is: more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency.
This Parliament ought to be ashamed of itself, in particular, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
While, in the Netherlands, nota bene, the Rutte cabinet is leaving the sick and the disabled out in the cold, the same groups in this House have a burning hole in their pockets.
Austerity champions at home, big spenders in Brussels.
This is an outrage!
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise several aspects of this important report, beginning with the European Union's revenue system.
By now, it is clear that the current mechanism has too many inconsistencies, the most famous of which is the United Kingdom's correction mechanism.
Various other corrections and compensations have since been added, making the EU revenue mechanism entirely inequitable and anything but transparent.
At this point, it would be better to move towards a direct revenue system based exclusively on the gross domestic product of the Member States, or towards a shared and unified form of revenue such as value added tax, for example.
Obviously, European citizens must not suffer any extra burdens, nor should Europe replace the tax policies of the Member States, which must remain autonomous and absolutely sovereign in this area.
The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive.
We can raise resources by using instruments such as project bonds and Eurobonds, which must, however, be managed with the utmost rigour so as not to risk the creation of further debt, which would be dangerous.
We, as Members of the European Parliament, can make an immediate contribution to improving Europe's finances.
We must, at long last, choose a single location for the work of Parliament, which would bring savings of tens of millions of euro each year.
This is not demagogy but simple ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, the mocking of Her Majesty's Government by Mr Verhofstadt when he shared with us his logic as to why Britain should hand over more money and more power to the EU was further evidence of the palpable disdain in which the UK, its national government and its citizens are held by some in this House.
What Mr Verhofstadt failed to mention is that other savings are available to the UK.
Businesses forced to spend GBP 30 million to comply with EU regulations could save this by taking back control from Europe.
UK fishermen would love to have the GBP 3.3 billion in their pockets: the value of the catch lost when the EU let other countries fish in their territorial waters.
Commissioner, you state that the European budget is not a duplication of a national budget.
However, it cannot be divorced from the realities of its citizens.
Currently, the UK contribution is GBP 6.4 billion, rising to over GBP 10 billion if the rebate goes.
It can only be met by raising taxes, cutting services, schools ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are five questions we need to ask ourselves:
The first is: what budget is required for the 2020 growth and employment strategy?
Secondly: what budget is required by a currency union?
Thirdly: what potential is open to us to make savings?
Fourthly: what budget is required by the United States of Europe?
Fifthly: what role is Europe 2020 to play?
Do we want to play a role at all?
We, the European Parliament, take our responsibilities seriously.
We deal in plain speaking.
In Austria, we have a saying: if you do not pay up, the band does not play.
We want to achieve our goals, meet our obligations, accept the challenges and keep our promises.
More functions, greater competitiveness, more sustainable growth, more jobs, more research and further integration cannot be achieved with less money, without a financial review, without an evaluation of existing disbursement of funds and without our own resources.
More Europe will also create a potential for savings in the Member States.
More Europe will also create more efficiency and is our response to globalisation, to the future and to sovereign debt.
What is it that we want?
We do not want to freeze the budget.
Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens.
We want to introduce a transaction levy as a resource of our own, accepting the challenges and adhering to the Treaty rather than burying our heads in the sand.
That is our strategy.
Let us really set the ball rolling and vote in favour of this report.
(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basic theme in Salvador Garriga's report is not about finances but policies.
I would like to thank him and Jutta Haug, as well as all the fellow Members on the committee, for having this as the predominant understanding during the work carried out throughout the whole year.
Financial resources are only a means of achieving the objectives.
Policies are what is important and what needs to be highlighted when the next financial framework is being discussed.
We are all aware that budgets are being cut in all the European Union's Member States.
This will also continue in the coming years.
These cuts are part of efforts to exit the crisis.
However, we must not forget that exiting the crisis also has European aspects: the economic development plan; financial market regulations to prevent this crisis from recurring; the measures currently being discussed on economic governance in the European Union;
This is why it is not appropriate for national measures aimed at tackling the crisis and its consequences to be made to clash with European measures.
Involvement in the European Union provides added value.
Added value and solidarity are not empty phrases.
Explaining to Dutch taxpayers that their contributions to the European Union are being increased is not the same as explaining to Bulgarian or Polish farmers that the subsidy they are receiving is three times less and that they are obliged to compete in the same competitive market.
It is not easy to make accusations against Greek taxpayers, who are going through extremely hard times at the moment because the European finance system obtained a huge amount of money from Greece only a few years ago.
Solidarity has specific aspects. These aspects are also linked to the priorities set by the European Union for the coming years.
No breakthrough can be achieved for the scientific sector, energy, transport, economic governance or digital technologies unless they are supported by common European policies.
Indeed, we also need to think about how to change the current European budget.
It does contain reserves and they need to be requested.
However, I will give you one example.
These reserves cannot be made available by, for example, all the policies or objectives relating to energy efficiency, transport and so on being incorporated into the cohesion policy.
Cutting the resources from existing programmes will not replace the need for additional new resources if we want to set new objectives for the European Union, if we want European integration to provide real added value, including for taxpayers, who rightly watch every penny allocated to the European budget.
This is why we also need to look at the European budget as part of one system: both for economic governance and for managing the single currency.
This minimum 5% increase, which is being questioned, is insufficient for resolving all these issues.
This is why we must also ask questions about European Project Bonds, Eurobonds and other means of funding.
(SV) Mr President, I have to say that in all my years in this Parliament, the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the most pleasant and the most visionary, in short, the most enjoyable - it really is very fine work.
It includes everything that is necessary and positive for Europe's future.
However, I am personally extremely concerned about what we did not do, and that is set priorities.
We have taken on board all of the new challenges, but we have also retained all of the old ones.
It will perhaps not be possible to deal with both.
We should have set priorities.
We should have been much more rigorous in setting priorities, but what is most worrying of all in this context is the fact that we have left the setting of priorities to the Council.
That does not bode well for the future, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr President, the public, the hardworking taxpayers across Europe who actually earn the money which so many in this place are so keen to spend, want Europe to do less and they want Europe to do it better.
They want a lean European budget which takes into account the fact that, whether we like it or not, we are living in an age of austerity.
They want Europe to focus on the very limited number of areas where Europe can actually add value, and leave the rest of the activities to our Member States.
Unfortunately, this report proposes none of these things.
Let us be clear: the suggestion of a 5% increase is completely unacceptable and the idea of so-called own resources is equally unacceptable - it is just a power-grab by the EU.
The budget should be modernised, funds should be reallocated to programmes which actually deliver future benefits and not cover up past failures.
Financing of euro bail-outs should be left to those countries that actually wanted to join the euro in the first place.
Those of us who warned that it was a mistake should not be forced to contribute to it.
The committee had a chance to pursue many of these constructive and future-proof suggestions; they rejected it.
They have done none of those things and the report should be rejected by this House.
(HU) Mr President, the report we have in front of us is perhaps the most important one of this period.
The European Parliament is the first among the institutions to draft its thoughts about the next seven years, but without prejudice to the Commission's right to submit proposals.
However, this is the only possibility to avoid a scandal about our right to consent that would oblige us to reject the proposal of the Council.
Thus, all of our partners know what the European Parliament wants and they can incorporate that into their ideas as far as possible.
To my dear fellow Members, may I recommend two documents that are worth reading before you turn your thoughts to rude criticism: the Treaty of Lisbon and the report itself.
Supporting own resources is no more, no less than what is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
I consider the message that the European budget needs a slight increase to be very important.
Slight in a sense that this 5% will also be modified by inflation, which means that we are not talking about an abnormal increase.
It is not about increasing the expenditure on agriculture or cohesion, but about the fact that these cannot be decreased.
Miklós Zrínyi, a writer of dual Croatian-Hungarian origin who lived in the 1600s said - in connection with the Turks at that time - 'Do not hurt the Hungarians!'
Quoting his words I say: Do not hurt the agricultural policy; do not hurt the cohesion policy; because those who hurt these policies not only hurt the Hungarians, the Romanians, the Slovaks, but all citizens of the European nations.
The lesser the voters' support behind a politician, the more he refers to citizens.
I believe that we, who enjoy the support of a greater political force, likewise represent citizens' interests, and this is the reason why we say: do not hurt the agricultural policy and cohesion!
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Chair for the work they have done on this report.
The debate today on the report highlights that there will be a fight in the Council on a number of issues, including the overall increase, the UK rebate and own resources.
To be fair, apart from the issue of the UK rebate where UK Members will be in a minority of one, I think the Parliament has tried to reach some compromises.
When you have long, complicated and important reports like this, compromise is almost inevitable, but I do welcome some of the compromises.
I welcome the compromise on the duration and the structure of the next financial perspective.
I also welcome the compromise on cohesion policy.
I believe that cohesion policy is vital if we are to achieve jobs and growth in the EU post-2013.
Therefore, for cohesion policy, we need adequate funding at least at the level we have now, if not more into the future.
The next financial perspective must be about jobs and growth if it is to be relevant to citizens.
Therefore, as well as a strong cohesion policy, we also need policies for funding research and development in our universities and SMEs.
FP8 therefore needs adequate funding for the future.
We also need to invest in our infrastructure in the European Union - infrastructure like transport, energy and improving broadband in many rural areas - and our rural areas themselves should not be forgotten.
To deliver all these policies on jobs and growth, we need delivery mechanisms.
We also need partners.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent report and for his excellent work on the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013.
One of the main objectives of future financial frameworks is to establish instruments to take the EU 2020 strategy to the grassroots level.
There is a realisation in this report that, without a cohesion and agricultural policy that is robust and strong in terms of its budget, this objective will not succeed.
Cohesion policy, for example, is not the only tangible instrument that will enable us to develop innovations and create jobs and growth.
We need reform, but we can also implement it within these policy sectors.
Consequently, I appeal to you, Commissioner, to ensure that, in the forthcoming financial period, both regional policy and agricultural policy maintain their existing budget levels, in accordance with Parliament's opinion.
I am, moreover, glad that the report also gives consideration to regions where conditions are especially tough, such as the sparsely populated areas of the north.
They will also need their own additional budgets in the forthcoming financial period
(NL) Mr President, the key word for Europe is 'confidence'.
The European institutions in general, and the European Parliament in particular, need to restore confidence among the citizens.
How can that be achieved?
Firstly, not with more Europe or more money for Europe, but with a better Europe, a Europe with an added value, and Europe should not interfere with matters, such as sport or tourism, which Member States can deal with perfectly well on their own.
Secondly, commit the cohesion fund to the genuinely poor regions in Europe.
We still have fifty percent going to rich Member States, such as Germany and France.
This is unacceptable.
If we sort this out, we will be able to rein in the unnecessary throwing around of money and still come out with a net profit.
Thirdly, investment in future-proof agriculture and industry.
The Polledo report has been a failure.
Everything and more has been chucked into one big melting pot and our citizens are expected to digest this gunge.
Bon appetit, but be careful you do not choke on it.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done, which has resulted in a report that enables a good start to be made on building a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and that constitutes a challenge for the Commission and the Council.
This is an ambitious report, whilst simultaneously being a realistic report.
I hope that all the institutions have drawn the correct conclusions from the financial, economic and social crisis that is slow to loosen its grip on us.
One conclusion is clear to me: only a united Europe that shows solidarity and strengthened, harmonised and convergent economic governance will be up to the task of successfully confronting the political challenges we have before us.
We need more and better Europe.
We need to give priority to the Community method rather than the intergovernmental method.
We need to increase the budget.
The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable.
It will be the guide for the next financial perspectives.
However, this strategy will only be successful if there is a budget corresponding to its activities; to its objectives.
As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Cohesion policy is also the result of the solidarity principle.
It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it act as a pull on the poorer regions.
I therefore believe it essential that funding for cohesion policy at least remain at the same levels, along with funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP).
It is also important to make progress towards an MFF, more than 80% of whose funds do not come from national budgets.
(HU) Mr President, the crisis compels us to review both national and European Union budgets from the aspect of efficiency and to see how they serve our goals, and how much added value, European added value, they bring to this effect.
I would like to talk about a field that has not been mentioned so far today, namely, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, which was elevated from the competence of Member States to EU policy level by the Treaty of Lisbon.
Our desire to achieve great improvement in this field must be reflected in the subsequent budget period.
We definitely have to provide funds for the Stockholm programme, which is a rather ambitious programme.
Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources.
The events in North Africa have drawn attention once again to the importance of a common European immigration policy, and have shown the need for integration supported by resources and for European solidarity.
The last few months have also highlighted the fact that protection of our common values, non-discrimination and human rights also need protection and resources, that we need to simplify the use of resources for the management of extraordinary situations, and that we need our own resources to create a better, stronger and more extensive Europe in the coming period.
Mr President, congratulations to the rapporteur for all the work he has done.
It is tremendous in terms of the achievement of trying to get a consensus.
There are three areas for amendment which I would plead in favour of.
Firstly, in the longer term, we need a five-year financial perspective.
If it is the case that 2020 is a seven-year dimension, we should have an absolute condition that the next one will be for a five-year period.
Secondly, there is insufficient work done on looking at how we get a statement of assurance for expenditure.
Those who are arguing for more money at a European level would have a stronger case if we knew that we had an absolute cast-iron understanding of where the money actually goes.
Last but not least, in reply to Mr Verhofstadt, it is unwise to single out any one Member State when there are a number of Member States which are net contributors to the budget.
I would urge very strongly that we should have a limit on the net contribution of Member States as a percentage of GDP because, looking forward, it is unrealistic to think you can get Member States' approval when their net contributions are doubling at a time of significant austerity.
(DE) Mr President, the 5% increase in the budget is explained by spending on the External Action Service, border protection, the war on terrorism, an increase in development aid, support for research and transnational infrastructure.
Overall, this request from Parliament is absolutely justified.
However, Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report.
We would have more credibility if we were to show where Europe can be more efficient and where money can be saved.
This certainly includes the large number of agencies that enjoy an extremely expensive autonomous existence, and agriculture, where some Member States have still not succeeded in introducing a more market-appropriate flat-rate acreage payment scheme.
As the rapporteur for the future of structural policy, I would also say that European cohesion policy should also be included here.
Happily, many regions have succeeded in exceeding the threshold for the maximum funding of 75%.
However, if there is less poverty in the various regions of Europe, then European solidarity may also recede.
The money saved could be better invested in European added value, for example, in a smart link between Structural Funds and transnational networks in the border regions.
This is currently under discussion by the Committee on Regional Development, as is a proposal for an intermediate category of 75 to 90% GDP, as suggested in the Garriga Polledo report.
Perhaps Mrs Krehl was dreaming if she believed that we had already agreed on a compromise in the Committee on Regional Development.
I do not believe that the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the right body to make recommendations for such an intermediate category.
We are making things too easy for ourselves if we simply also define the more prosperous regions as requiring particular support.
The way I see it, this is an invitation to waste money.
We are leaving the tried and tested phasing-out/phasing-in system but are no longer offering any incentive.
We are guaranteeing a permanent subsidy for all regions almost up to a level of average economic strength.
There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy.
We therefore need to drop paragraph 73 from the report.
Otherwise, the report is acceptable.
(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))
(DE) Mr President, Mr Pieper, I am surprised to hear you say that Mrs Krehl must be dreaming.
A large majority voted in favour of the intermediate goal when the vote was held in the Committee on Regional Development.
I believe that we will get the backing of the majority here, too, because there is majority support for the solidarity of the regions.
That is why we need this intermediate goal.
I should be interested to know why you refer to this majority as a dream.
Mr Pieper, can you explain why it is a dream?
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, this is your perception of the issue.
We in the Committee on Regional Development have a different proposal from the one contained in the Garriga Polledo report.
That is my first point.
My second point is that significant fundamental resistance to the intermediate category still exists within the political groupings.
You are well aware of this.
That is why I find your question surprising.
I think that you are dreaming when you simply claim that we have come up with compromises and that these are unambiguous.
Anyway, it is a matter for the Committee on Regional Development to prepare the matter for debate in plenary.
I am very surprised by your extremely optimistic view that our work is complete.
(FR) Mr President, the debate on the European Union's financial perspective raises questions about the European project, its scope and its ambition.
This report is laudable because it seeks to mobilise the Union's budgetary resources in order to comply with the Europe 2020 strategy.
This puts it at odds with the narrow vision of most Member States.
Whereas Member States see Europe in terms of their financial contribution, which they want to see reduced, and the financial returns, which they want to see increased, this report argues in favour of strong and integrated Community policies, be they long-established policies or new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon.
Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution.
It is true that a 5% increase in the European budget would be better than the Member States' budgetary plans for 2012.
However, the crux of the matter - and probably the stumbling block - will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report.
We are aware of the downsides of austerity policies: how they affect employment and have left growing numbers of citizens despairing.
We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions.
I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions.
Let me conclude by saying that we need to impose a tax on financial speculation, which would increase our citizens' support for a well-financed Europe.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for highlighting the number of challenges in front of us.
I also welcome the very clear message in the report calling for a significant increase in research and science because that is one of the priorities we need to have.
I would like to say - and I say this to the Commission - that politics and leadership are about priorities.
Without priorities, there is no leadership.
There are always those tasks and challenges that are more important than others.
That is the case with the budget of the European Union as well as in Member States.
We need to further increase research and science, but we also need to increase the amount of science and research in regional funding.
We need to take into consideration the development of the agricultural markets and decrease the spending there.
But let us remember that we need to set priorities at all levels, at the European level as well as in Member States.
I must say that I dislike EU-bashing or Brussels-bashing, but I also dislike Member States-bashing, because it diminishes the importance of the spending we have in the Member States: health care, social security, pensions, education.
This is not a conflict between the EU and the Member States.
This is an ongoing struggle for leadership and priorities.
If we do not dare to set those priorities, we do not show leadership.
I must say that if we cannot understand the tough situation Member States are in today, we do not understand the reality for citizens.
We need to set priorities and not solve problems just by increasing budgets.
So I would ask the Commissioner to show leadership, to be courageous, and to remember that research and science, infrastructure ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013.
It begins with the request for coherence between objectives and instruments, and between the new role that the European institutions must perform - in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recession - and the resources that, together, we decide to invest.
Such coherence also implies a serious response to the demand for innovation from the public, from the recipients of EU policies, and from Europe's social groups and industries.
We did the same for cohesion, which is a crucial issue for deciding what we want the European Union to be in the coming years.
Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew.
On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus.
However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe's cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.
(FR) Mr President, the 500 million citizens of the European Union currently make up over 8% of the world's population.
By 2050, that figure will be 5% or 6%.
In 2100, we will make up 3% of that population.
This throng of Europeans continues to maintain, largely through national budgets, 2 000 embassies, 27 armies, 50 joint forces and more.
I believe China is currently employing extra deputy ministers just to receive all the mighty European ministers who arrive to petition Beijing for favours and bilateral agreements.
All of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage.
Dividing up 8% of the world's population between 30 sovereign budgetary policies is madness.
Essentially, that sovereignty remains absolute.
Europe manages 2.5% or one-fortieth of total budgetary expenditure in Europe.
The Member States' contributions make up one-fortieth of their national spending.
Yet apparently, even that is too much.
Let us now consider the question of own resources or maybe another time.
Let us stop carping about the 2.5% of public spending with which we are supposed to maintain the whole apparatus required to implement the 2020 strategy and to fulfil all the responsibilities accorded to us under the Treaty of Lisbon.
We did not devise the strategy and competences: it was the Member States who did that.
In view of these realities, Mr Garriga Polledo's report is modest.
Yet there are those who want to restrict us yet further and who would deem the report ambitious.
That is why this House should adopt the report.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is vital to the future of the European project, which should involve solidarity and ambitious aims, particularly in view of the budgetary crises that Member States are currently struggling with.
Taking an ultra-liberal approach, the majority of Heads of State or Government in the Council are choosing to keep slashing budgets wildly and are willing to sacrifice investment in key forward-looking policies such as those funded by the European budget.
A budget freeze will dent growth, no matter what other Members might say.
An increase of at least 5%, as recommended in this consensus report, is the minimum if we are to tackle the challenges and stand together.
European solidarity includes the need to finance the 2020 strategy, not least its social objectives, which include combating poverty.
The report has also persuaded me that European solidarity should be strengthened by the creation of intermediate regions in order to ensure that the cohesion policy provides fair coverage for the whole of Europe.
Finally, another example is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which offers real solidarity for European workers.
The report recognises the valuable role played by this Fund.
The increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework is necessary.
It should not be seen as a burden on Member States because the European budget provides added value and will, in future, include a tax on financial transactions.
(EL) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon created new fields of competence and strengthened Union policies, as reflected in the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2013 to 2020.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga, on his integrated report, which sets out the political priorities of a different Europe from the Europe we know.
Given the major internal challenges faced by the Union and its citizens and bearing in mind its enhanced international character, we realise that the main objective of its policy must be to reduce the existing social, economic and territorial inequalities.
A planned and successful cohesion policy constitutes per se European added value and will surely prove to be to the benefit of all the Member States of the Union.
The new programme and the new seven-year framework are based on actions in the EU 2020 strategy and are designed to help Europe to recover from the crisis, by promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The political priorities and objectives set are to promote employment, to strengthen innovation, research and growth, to address climate change, to improve education levels, to achieve social integration and to combat poverty, alongside policies on immigration and to safeguard resources to develop inaccessible and border areas.
The Union budget is the main mechanism for activating solidarity between the Member States and is a strong tool for a reform that could mobilise additional private and public resources to support investments that will act as a catalyst in terms of the exponential effect of spending by the Union.
The European budget must be increased and must be based on real own resources if we want a strong Europe for its citizens and towards the rest of the world.
The Union budget is a tool for global and integrated development at a time when the Member States alone cannot ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said that money forms the sinews of war.
We must remember that money also forms the backbone of a peace project like the European Union.
If Europe really intends to implement the policies enshrined in the Treaties, including the new policies found in the Treaty of Lisbon, it needs the financial wherewithal to realise those aims.
Consequently, I am in favour of establishing own resources and a tax on financial transactions.
The necessary increase in the European budget must go hand in hand with significant savings from optimising our spending.
For example, let us create a real Common Foreign and Security Policy to give Europe more influence on the world stage, but also in order to make the best use of public money.
The report by Mr Garriga Polledo is crucial, almost a complete recast: it recommends a very strong political and financial framework for the European Union.
What is more, two key Union policies are given their rightful place.
On the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is crucial for food security and self-sufficiency, the report advocates renewing the CAP budget.
On the cohesion policy, which is the financial instrument used to create regional solidarity and encourage regional economic development, the report proposes enhancing its objectives by creating a category for intermediate regions so that regions at the same developmental level can benefit ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I would like to say a few words on the need to move towards own resources reform.
I believe that the dominating role of GNI-based revenue makes a decision on the EU budget over-politicised and less efficiency-oriented.
It facilitates demands to freeze or to reduce EU spending.
It leads to the logic expressed in the context of the 2011 budget negotiations that if we cut our national budgets due to the crisis, we should apply the same approach to the EU budget.
It is, however, not at all obvious that with an additional own resource that would reduce the dependence on GNI, we can expect a revolution in EU capacities to finance growth and structural change.
There is always a risk that the same coalition that adopts the budgetary decision in the Council can also adopt the same decision in the European Parliament.
If we care for Europe, we should move away from responding to the expectations of Finance Ministers and move towards citizens' expectations.
The success of a national politician returning home from Brussels negotiations should not be based on the message that the government will pay less to the EU budget but, for example, on the message that the EU will help to make small companies fund innovation projects.
It is clear that the way EU costs are financed should be fully transparent.
This could be easier to achieve with only one tax, but it is also feasible to build the revenue on a group of taxes that meet criteria on transparency, equity, visibility, efficiency and sufficient harmonisation.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I will begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work.
I welcome the fact that the priorities put forward in this report are in line with the Europe 2020 strategy and make growth central to European policy.
We need more and better Europe.
As such, we should promote the areas that contribute most to competitiveness, like research, innovation and energy.
We therefore need to significantly increase financing of science and innovation, so as to promote scientific excellence throughout Europe.
It is also important to strengthen the European system for financing science so as to realise the objective of investing 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The new budget should also promote increased energy efficiency and support the construction of future infrastructure, energy infrastructure in particular, thereby creating the necessary conditions for European industry to be competitive.
There is a need to increase the role of industry, in particular, that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), so contributing to reinforcing Europe's position of leadership in a globalised world.
(IT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his excellent work throughout the year, which has received broad political backing.
I welcome the message that this report has managed to get across: the solution to the crisis is the assertion of the Union's status as a global player.
The future financial framework mirrors the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and is grounded firmly within the Treaty of Lisbon.
However, suitable funding is required for the Union's priorities to be credible.
The development of energy and transport infrastructure, investment in research and development, learning and youth policy must find fresh impetus in the Union's future budgets, while the fundamental pillars of the cohesion policy and the agricultural policy should continue to receive the current amount of funding.
Europe and its big projects clash with budgetary constraints at national level, meaning that greater involvement of the private sector through project bonds or public/private partnerships is the key to raising competitiveness and growth.
Together with the rest of the Italian delegation, I am concerned about the proposals to add these so-called 'intermediate categories' to the regional policy, as this risks harming the weakest regions of the Union.
I will conclude by asserting that financing the Union entirely through a system based on own resources is the only way to ensure the future and the development of the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Staff Regulations is to be presented together with the MFF package.
This question of how the EU is actually administered is dealt with very succinctly in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the Garriga Polledo report.
Commissioner, I would ask you to be ambitious when presenting the Staff Regulations.
After all, the question of what we do, which has been discussed in detail here, is at least as important as the question of how we do it.
The question is what role will the European Commission play in future when implementing all the points in the 2020 programme we have presented today.
I would like to see the Commission choose a stronger role for itself, rather than delegating all the tasks to others.
That is why it is important, in the context of the Staff Regulations reform, that vacancies should be created for these new tasks, so that the Commission itself can also get involved.
We have an enormous number of free days.
The Commission's officials have up to 13 weeks paid leave.
Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve.
I would ask that we should also be provided with an EU 2020 strategy for the administration of the EU.
This would require action not only from you, but also from the entire college and the President of the Commission.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on having drafted such an excellent report on the Multiannual Financial Framework.
The report gained very strong support within the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013.
I hope that the report will serve as a key foundation for negotiations on the new multiannual European Union budget, which will commence shortly.
I am very pleased that MEPs have decided to support the amendment I tabled regarding the strengthening of policies on youth.
At a time when young Europeans are some of the main victims of the economic crisis, we should support all initiatives aimed at improving the situation of young people and, in particular, those aimed at improving access to education and their professional situation.
Programmes such as 'Youth in Action' and 'Lifelong Learning', which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective, should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks, and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding.
At the same time, I would like to commend the proposal to maintain a high level of funding for cohesion policy.
Cohesion policy not only plays a key role in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy; its primary task is to strengthen European integration and solidarity by reducing the social, economic and territorial differences that still unfortunately exist within the European Union.
(RO) Mr President, the rapporteur started his presentation with a very important sentence, saying that we need to combine traditional European Union policies with our new priorities.
Neither one nor the other can operate without each other.
In this context, I would like to welcome the vision of the common agricultural policy outlined in the report.
I will remind you, if I may, of some of the important ideas, the main one being maintaining the level of the CAP budget during the forthcoming financial programming period.
The traditional role of European agriculture, along with the new ambitions we are aspiring to, fully justifies maintaining the level of this budget.
Secondly, the need to maintain a CAP system based on two pillars, while promoting rural areas as part of the second pillar, is closely linked to the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.
One final point is the need for a reformed CAP in the future, aimed at using the budget more effectively, based on a fair distribution of payments as one of the options for achieving this.
(LT) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the tremendous work they have done.
Today, we have a clear parliament position on what we and our citizens expect from the forthcoming financial programming period.
We all understand that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy and this is reflected clearly in the Europe 2020 strategy.
We have to develop a safe single European energy market, ensure that the whole of Europe is connected through transport networks and eradicate the disparities that still exist among the various European Union regions.
We must completely review the common agricultural policy, which must guarantee a fair and uniform system of direct payments, and many other important areas, without which we will be unable to create a competitive and strong Europe.
Of course, this will require major investment, particularly in research.
Therefore, it is necessary to look for new financial instruments, such as the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, etc.
I believe that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President, one of the key issues that has emerged out of this debate is: 'What exactly is European added value?'
I hope that the Commission, when it comes up with its proposals at the end of this month, will give a clear explanation as to why certain budget headings have a clear added value.
It seems to me that it is precisely that which we need to know, because then we will be able to justify what we are voting for.
Secondly, the debate will also be strongly influenced by the debates on own resources.
One of the issues which has poisoned the debate is the decision on the British rebate taken in 1984.
How has it been able to continue for so long?
I think that either the British Government should not be entitled to any rebate at all or that other countries which find themselves in a similar situation to that which Great Britain was in in 1984 should be treated the same.
I hope that the Commission proposals will, in fact, move in this direction.
(ES) Mr President, this obsession with focusing only on the quantity of the cuts to be made and not on how or what to cut, and even less on how to increase revenue, is already a cause for concern.
Firstly, more Europe means a better Europe insofar as it means less economic power for the Member States.
Secondly, we must, of course, also review expenses.
However we must be careful about where we do so: one proposal would be to reduce military spending; another would be to reduce the two European Parliament sites to a single one.
We believe that these are the most important suggestions.
Thirdly, what most concerned me was seeing Mr Lewandowski smiling, in what I believe to be a worrying way, when the subject of the tax on financial transactions was mentioned.
It worried me, and I would ask him how it could be so bad, so detrimental, to ask those who have become rich by speculating to pay for the crisis instead of asking those who are least to blame for it to do so, and not do as you did yesterday, calling for Spain to reduce social spending through a reduction in expenditure on ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(LV) Mr President, I should like to remind fellow Members of one thing - when approving the budget, we must remember that among residents of Europe, scepticism is growing regarding what we do here.
In this regard, it seems to me that the budget is not sufficiently coordinated with the ambitious goals included in the EU 2020 programme.
I also have a question: you, Commissioner, promised Latvian farmers that direct payments would be evened out with this budget.
However, if it is approved as it stands now, it will be difficult for you to keep your promise.
I want all that we talk about and that we discuss to correspond also with the interests of our constituents.
Mr President, I thought the EU could not get any worse and then I came across this report.
It starts with a hefty helping of self-delusion: 'never have Europeans been more demanding of the EU'.
Well, increasing numbers of British people are demanding that we come out of it.
Perhaps that is what they mean.
It dismisses utterly the idea of freezing the budget after 2013 and insists that even an increase of 5% would allow only a limited contribution to the EU's objectives.
Well, we must be thankful for small mercies.
Tucked away in the middle of paragraph 166 is a call for an end to rebates.
This is the device by which the United Kingdom pays only an unacceptable net contribution instead of an outrageous net contribution.
Insisting that the UK should pay over its hard-earned money is bad enough, but paragraph 169 suggests that the EU should have the power to levy its own taxes without our consent and without our control.
That is simply unacceptable.
(PL) Mr President, we have achieved an important consensus.
The report that has been presented is a necessary continuation of what has gone before, while also proposing the expected changes.
Stability is a characteristic feature of EU policies, hence, the proposal to maintain the current budget for cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy.
Levelling the playing field in terms of development contributes significantly to strengthening the common market, which yields positive outcomes for all EU Member States.
The common agricultural policy benefits every consumer in the EU.
It is worth bearing in mind that farmers have very low incomes, in spite of the support they receive from the European budget.
The new tasks with which agriculture has been faced in respect of the environment, the climate, animal welfare and unrealistic WTO negotiations mean additional costs for farmers.
Who will pay?
The changes that we expect include an increase in funding for sustainable and smart development, and an emphasis on innovation, scientific research and education.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament is sending a clear message today, both to the European Commission and to the prime ministers of the European Union, for a budget up to 2020 which is commensurate with its responsibilities and public expectations.
As far as cohesion policy is concerned, the message is clear.
'Yes' to a cohesion policy with sufficient financing to make a decisive contribution to development, to new jobs and to innovation.
'Yes' to an independent cohesion policy.
'Yes' to coordination at all policy making levels, from strategic planning through to implementation.
'Yes' to the creation of an intermediate category of support for the regions.
'Yes' to special measures for island and mountainous areas in Europe.
However, there are also two clear and important 'no's'.
'No' to any splitting of this policy in different sectors and, finally, 'no' to the imposition of sanctions in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact.
That concludes the 'catch the eye' procedure and I apologise to the 11 or 12 Members who were on the list and have been unable to speak, but clearly there is no time for their speeches.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have already used up my speaking time so I shall make just two short remarks.
First, in the present international context of austerity, the European budget, which is without deficit, cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of national finances.
It can, however, help create jobs and growth because it is about investment.
In this, it differs from national budgets, which are mainly about social transfers.
Second, as regards promises to the farmers in Europe, gradual convergence is realistic.
A flat rate is not feasible at the moment, and I believe it will remain that way in the coming years.
Finally, on behalf of the Commission, I expect the forthcoming vote to reflect the broad consensus in this Chamber, making the voice of the European Parliament strong and influential.
We will end the debate with a speech from Mr Garriga Polledo as rapporteur, whom I wholeheartedly congratulate on his excellent work on this subject.
Mr President, I firstly want to thank the national delegations, who I understand have resisted pressure in their Member States and will vote for this report.
I feel that this is not a debate on budget volume, but rather on the supremacy of the Community method, and I think that those who have focused this debate on efforts to reduce the Union budget have made a mistake.
They want new priorities and a reduced budget; I say to them that going down this route will mean that they end up with a reduced budget and fewer priorities.
I certainly do not understand how they can sit in this hemicycle and defend an intergovernmental approach.
Leave that step to the Council; you should defend a European Union, with its policies, priorities, responsibilities, and an adequate budget.
We do not want an increase of 5% in European public spending; instead, we are seeking to alleviate national budgetary burdens and gather certain transnational investments into the EU budget, where they can be more efficiently utilised.
That is the European added value that all groups in this Chamber accepted in the Policy Challenges (SURE) Committee this year.
I think this is certainly a far-reaching proposal; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the Member States, and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails.
I want to acknowledge the constructiveness of the proposals and the debate, which I feel has been sufficiently vibrant and has fully expressed the mosaic of viewpoints which unite the European Parliament.
I think that we come out of this debate, in any case, in a much richer position as a House and with a much improved political profile.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12:00.
(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)
Written statements (Rule 149)
Due to the current crisis and the drastic public spending restrictions, Member States are finding it increasingly difficult to record economic growth.
I must stress the need for the EU to respond to demographic challenges.
The decline in the proportion of the working population, combined with the rise in the proportion of people in retirement will put a strain on social protection systems.
I support the idea that all the funding provided by the EU should help improve the general state of the European environment.
Consequently, the positive and negative impact on the climate and environment and the use of EU funds should be analysed at every level.
Investments at EU level can achieve considerably greater savings at national level, especially in the areas where the EU unquestionably provides greater added value than national budgets.
The continuing debate on the forthcoming programming period shows us that it will be necessary to focus to a greater extent this time on a more comprehensive approach to this primary economic instrument for EU policies.
The global financial crisis and the intense global competitive pressures from the economic tigers of China and India show us that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will have to be set up in such a way that it corresponds to the main objectives of the 2020 agenda.
The rapporteur's idea of merging all policies relating to the 2020 agenda into the single area of the MFF looks extremely bold.
The rapporteur is quite right to propose a legally binding review of the limits in individual areas half way through the programming period.
Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby increasing democratic control and accountability.
The rapporteur's idea that we must consider reforming EU revenues is undoubtedly correct in principle.
It is also entirely appropriate to move across gradually to a system of own resources for the EU, thereby replacing the current system of Member State contributions, as this leads to comparisons of the balance between the EU and Member States, causing the general public to draw the wrong conclusions over the meaning of EU membership, which is an entirely mistaken conclusion given the current interconnectedness of economies and policies.
Mr Garriga Polledo's report sets out to define the European Parliament's political priorities for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013, both in terms of legislation and the budget.
Two elements in particular caught my eye: firstly, that cohesion for growth and employment is a political priority.
I fully support the creation of an intermediate region category.
This would apply to all regions where GDP per capita falls between 75% and 90% of EU GDP.
This would serve to create a better balance between regions.
The proposal puts into practice the principle of territorial cohesion as set out in Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
On the subject of the financial perspectives, I am in favour of taxing financial transactions so as to build up own resources for the European Union.
in writing. - I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax (FTT).
A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once - how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place, and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause.
The tax revenues could moderate payments EU Member States currently make to the EU budget.
At the same time, they will allow the smooth development of policies to safeguard the economic future of Europe.
We would have the resources for investment in research and development, fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU.
Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world.
I urge the European Commission to act promptly on foot of this report and meet the demands of this democratically elected Parliament to bring forward appropriate measures.
Let us look at the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).
The EU's expansion to 12 new countries, generally with lower levels of development than the average for the 15 previous Member States, has brought undeniable challenges and demands in terms of realising the principle of economic and social cohesion.
However, what we have seen is a relative cut in the Structural Funds from 0.42% to 0.37% of EU gross national income (GNI).
In other words: they have been cut in relative terms at the time they were most needed.
The results are plain to see: instead of the promised convergence, what we have is a visible divergence, exacerbated by the effects of the economic and social crisis, and by the functioning and development of instruments like the Single Market, to the benefit of some and to the clear detriment of others.
This is the MFF now serving as a benchmark for the debate on the financial perspectives 2013-2020, with the proposal being, essentially, to maintain it.
The 5% increase will not raise the EU budget substantially above 1% of Union GNI.
Once again, this is threatening the heralded principle of cohesion.
This is made even worse by the fact that available resources are now channelled into other purposes - included, nonetheless, in the Treaties: militarism and overseas intervention, amongst others - that make this principle even more secondary in nature.
Although there were grounds for freezing EU expenditure during the economic crisis, we cannot use the same arguments that we did two years ago when considering the Multiannual Financial Framework today.
Instead, we must ask ourselves questions regarding the principles governing the EU's functioning in the next seven-year period: is it to be an EU based on solidarity, which fulfils its obligations and establishes an innovative economy and a common foreign policy in line with the Treaty of Lisbon?
Or is it instead to be an EU which did admittedly include ambitious objectives in the Treaty, but which everyone knows was only playing make-believe?
I am a staunch advocate of the former, and I support the rapporteur's opinion as regards the need to increase funding in the next Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% compared to 2013 levels.
This change would bring us closer to achieving the ambitious goals enshrined in the Treaty, and a 5% increase in expenditure would actually mean a very small increase, since inflation currently stands at 3.2%.
Furthermore, this insignificant increase in the EU budget will benefit the poorest regions, which gain most from EU assistance granted in order to ensure that differences in development are overcome.
I hope that the next Presidency, which will be held by Poland, will make it a priority to reconcile the positions of the 'net payers', such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, with Parliament's position, as set out in the ambitious Garriga Polledo report.
In the past, MEPs had only limited influence in talks on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the Union.
The fundamental change ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon applies precisely to this long-term programming of the budget, which must be compiled afresh by the Council after approval by the European Parliament.
This was the reason for establishing the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE), which defines in its report the political priorities of the European Parliament ahead of the start of talks on the next MFF following 2013.
It is clear from the report of Salvador Garriga Polledo that adequate funding will have to be secured for EU policies if the Union still wants to focus on achieving the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Without sufficient new resources after 2013, the Union will be unable to fulfil either the current political priorities or the new tasks and objectives from the Europe 2020 strategy.
In view of the inadequacy of the EU's traditional own resources, a specialist discussion was started in the SURE committee on new own resources for the EU budget.
We have a great opportunity in the next financial framework to show European citizens that the Union is capable of thinking and acting in their long-term interest, and achieving effective results in securing internal cohesion and solid growth.
I therefore entirely agree with the rapporteur's priority statement that the sums earmarked for the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy in the next period must not be lower than in the current framework.
The draft proposal, which was supported by eight committees, starts out from challenges to which the new Multiannual Financial Framework has to respond as well.
The current crisis is the last warning for Europe to react to the transformation in world order.
Like all transformations, the emerging order will produce winners and losers.
Europe shall not be among the losers.
Jean Monnet warned in his time: 'Europe has never existed.
The founding father of European integration did not regard this task as a single act, but as continuous work.
Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser.
The Commission submitted the Europe 2020 strategy last year, whose aim is recovery from the crisis and the preparation of the European economy for the next decade.
The three key areas that promote economic growth are the following: knowledge, innovation, education; or 'intelligent growth' that puts digital society in the centre, sustainable development that promotes more efficient energy use and enhances competitiveness, and inclusive growth that increases participation in the labour market.
The new Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union must be established at Community level and national development programmes should be adjusted to each other in a way that they result in an optimal implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy by creating the necessary synergies.
People expect concrete results from the EU more than ever during economically difficult times.
We need better, simpler legislation which serves the interests of Europeans.
Regulation needs to be pruned.
There is no reason to draft European legislation unless there is a real need for it.
The EU's forthcoming budget should respond more effectively to the day-to-day problems faced by the public.
The budget should support growth and new jobs, but, above all, it should create European added value.
At the end of this month, the Commission is to publish its proposals for the EU's budget after 2014.
With the economic crisis, the Member States of the EU have had to make tough decisions with respect to their own budgets.
In times of crisis, the EU's budget should not be increased either.
On the contrary, it should be cut.
I hope that, ultimately, we will rid ourselves of much of the foolishness that is associated with the EU.
Parliament's monthly trek between Brussels and Strasbourg costs European taxpayers a good EUR 200 million a year.
This money can be put to better use.
The various discounts that are granted to the United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Germany should be abolished altogether.
This year, the United Kingdom alone will receive a rebate of some EUR 3 billion because of a discount on contributions negotiated in 1984.
It is time the EU and its budget were reformed.
The money that European taxpayers provide has to be used more effectively and bring European added value to the Member States.
An increase in administration, red tape and unnecessary EU legislation does not represent that.
The new Multiannual Financial Framework is extremely significant because the European Union's future will, to a great extent, depend on it.
The debate on the financial perspective is not an easy one because many Member States are feeling the effects of the economic crisis.
Their reluctance to increase the EU budget is quite understandable.
Nevertheless, the financial sceptics should be aware of the extent of the benefits the common market confers upon the individual Member States' economies.
European integration has a positive and stimulating influence on the economy.
In addition, the European Parliament would like the new financial framework to be structured in such a way as to increase competitiveness and promote social integration.
The EU budget funds measures which are absolutely vital for the citizens of all the Member States.
This is not an abstract statement.
Cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy have an impact on the daily lives of millions of citizens.
There can be no doubt that some of the tasks performed by the EU would not be carried out by any other body.
Increasing the level of social, economic and infrastructure cohesion or ensuring equality of opportunity in the agricultural sector are objectives which deserve our support.
It is worth spending European money on them.
The European Union cannot carry out more measures in more Member States with a smaller budget.
This is not feasible, and this is why we need a larger and ambitious budget.
As the rapporteur writes, European Union assistance is essential if the Member States are to be in a position to meet future challenges.
The Europe 2020 strategy indicates the appropriate areas where this assistance should be focused, by outlining the priorities and vision of a strong, stable and modern Europe; a Europe which will have learnt its lesson from its recent economic problems and a Europe which will ensure jobs, energy security and healthy food for its citizens.
Budgetary plans should take account of the most important objectives of sustainable development, at the same time as being flexible and focused on concrete measures.
I barely need mention the fact that money must be spent transparently and for good reason.
Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU's functioning.
in writing. - To achieve the 2020 goals, a European approach is needed.
At the same time, one has to realise that more Europe cannot be achieved with less money.
Freezing the resources by Member States will not be a sustainable option.
Once Member States have accepted long-term strategic all-European political commitments, it is not possible to deny them financing.
This will only undermine the EU's credibility in the eyes of millions of citizens.
In practical terms, much better coordination of the programmes is required, concentrating on their complementarities.
Financing the new priorities - R&D, innovation, and energy and transportation networks - will be unrealistic while retaining the present level of resources.
The real internal EU challenge is to make the older EU15 and younger EU12 meet at the end of the next financial framework.
Continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in-depth scrutiny.
Commitment to the EU's principles of equality and solidarity should end the existence of different standards and also prejudices in decision making.
The EU can succeed when all its Members are treated by the same standards.
A true financial perspective has to look even further forward than seven years.
However, I support flexible mechanisms for necessary adaptations.
The European Union's poorest regions are developing rapidly at present, and one of the reasons for this is European funding.
Although many new roads have been built or repaired and Internet connections have been installed, there are still a great many needs to be met, since there is a very large gap between these regions and the most highly developed regions.
When we joined the European Union, there were fears that Poland and the new Member States would not make proper use of the opportunities afforded to them by membership, and that European funds would be spent without due consideration.
Fears were also voiced regarding corruption, since opportunity - or a great deal of money - makes the thief.
Meanwhile, analyses have shown that European money has been spent wisely in Poland, and has not been linked with dishonest practices.
Therefore, in view of the gap we are trying to bridge and, at the same time, the EU's future goals, we must not reduce either the EU budget or the funds for implementing cohesion policy.
Even if the European Parliament votes through an increase to the European budget, which I hope will be the case, it is now important to convince the individual Member States that it is worth supporting Parliament's political position.
I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Garriga Polledo for having prepared a comprehensive report, and for the impressive amount of work he has put into drafting compromise amendments.
I agree with the rapporteur that cohesion policy, which has proven its effectiveness, should be given a place in the new Multiannual Financial Framework which is commensurate with its importance.
However, we should strive for better coordination and complementarity of the individual funds, and for simplified procedures.
Changes to systems for monitoring and managing funds, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of their interventions, should be based on a thorough analysis of their current functioning.
I also support the view that unused funds should remain in the budget earmarked for cohesion, and not returned to the Member States, and I believe that we need a thorough analysis of the possible consequences of including the European Development Fund in the EU budget, in particular, in light of the EU's obligations to third countries.
Europe is experiencing a crisis.
The tax shortfalls of self-governing regions exceed 20% of the budget, compared to the period before the crisis, which is unsustainable.
The revenue shortfalls for municipalities look very similar. They cannot fund their core competences, they are laying off employees and they are getting into debt.
In such a situation, we should not be surprised that they fail to understand why the European Parliament is asking for more resources.
However, if states coordinated their policies and funding in the area of priorities, they would achieve better results and would save more funds than the amount by which we want to increase the common EU budget.
There is therefore no better alternative than the one we are discussing today.
We must discuss it and debate it more, not only in the European Parliament, but especially with ministers in the Council, with members of national parliaments, and also in the regions, so that they understand that a joint solution will bring not only the best result for our citizens, but will also lead to savings in national budgets.
Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors find themselves not just paying the EU budget through the huge redistribution mechanism, but actually paying two and three times over.
In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees.
This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working German, French, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries.
The people in the economically strong EU countries are angry - at least every bit as angry as the demonstrators in Athens - because they have to tighten their belts for the sake of the PIIG states.
Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous.
We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors.
Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings.
Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised.
This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector.
If the enormous amount of money paid in taxes were to reach small and medium-sized farmers instead of big landowners, agricultural factories, large businesses, monarchs and golf clubs, then maybe it would be possible to halt the decline in farming.
The adoption of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo marks an import step for this House: it constitutes a clear, pragmatic and realistic statement of the European Parliament's budgetary ambitions post-2013.
Firstly, on cohesion policy, which is key to regional development.
I believe that we need to maintain the cohesion policy budget and create an equitable aid model for all regions with intermediary income so as to make future EU investments in the regions transparent and fair.
The 5% budget increase is reasonable.
It is not, as the Eurosceptics claim, an example of European profligacy, but rather a courageous admission that if we do not give ourselves the means to build Europe together, we will remain isolated and powerless.
Consequently, so as to be able to finance the actions linked to the EU's new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon, I am supporting the request for the question of own resources to be examined and for new forms of Community income, in order to ease the pressure on national budgets and to do away with the belief in a 'fair return' which is economically inaccurate and politically unsound.
The European Parliament is presenting the European Commission and Council with its vision of the European Union's priorities for the 2014-2020 period for the first time.
It is now the European Commission's turn to take into account in its legislative proposal the European Parliament's opinion.
I should stress in particular that the development of a competitive agricultural sector and economic and social cohesion should be maintained as priorities for the period ahead.
MEPs have also given their due attention to Europe's research efforts.
The European Parliament's entire vision is firmly grounded in the Europe 2020 strategy.
When determining the framework of the next budget, the first question to ask is whether we want more or less Europe.
In my opinion, Parliament has already taken a stand in this question.
We have already stated that we need more Europe by accepting the ambitious goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Now we have to declare loud and clear that these objectives can only be achieved if we assign sufficient resources to them.
In a period when many Member States are suffering from the 'Mediterranean dilemma', whereby the country needs fiscal expansion in order to stimulate growth, but it cannot be done because never-ending austerity measures would be inevitable due to the country's indebtedness, we cannot respond by decreasing or approving the current EU budget that is fundamentally aimed at development.
We cannot, because it would mean depriving regions lagging behind of their only chance to put their economies on a path to growth.
The creation of 'intermediate regions' as proposed in the report means that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States will still receive support, and will be able to prepare gradually for the point in time when they lose this additional funding entirely.
The possibility of creating such a group of regions is undoubtedly a very welcome development for the main beneficiaries of cohesion policy, which have to make long-term plans.
Parliament's adoption of this proposal today would send out a very important message in the debate on the future shape of cohesion policy.
The Galliga Polledo report devotes much attention to the Europe 2020 programme.
I believe that earmarking significant amounts of money for the objectives of this programme may result in a drop in funding for programmes which are important for European cohesion and development, such as the cohesion fund.
The outcomes show that this fund has been the most effective tool to date for accomplishing the goals enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is therefore important for its funding to be increased.
Many European countries have been severely affected by the economic crisis and for them, the cohesion fund is now a driving force making it possible to fight unemployment proactively and to mobilise regions.
On the other hand, it is important for the EU to provide financial support for energy projects and innovation.
These two areas of investment are the key to the rapid growth of the European Union.
At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia.
This entails significant capital outflow beyond our borders, and we should therefore earmark more funds for supporting infrastructure investments which allow for a diversification of supply and a subsequent drop in prices, including the Nabucco pipeline, which is the most important project in terms of diversification.
The report also fails to set out any clear guidelines regarding support for shale gas exploration in the near future.
The EU must not forget that making wise investments today in sources of energy will mean capital savings tomorrow.
