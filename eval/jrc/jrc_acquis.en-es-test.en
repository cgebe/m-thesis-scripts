ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
Letter No 1
Sir,
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton, lamb and goatmeat from Argentina, on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat. During these negotiations both parties agreed as follows: 1. This arrangement shall relate to: - fresh or chilled mutton, lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV a)),
- frozen mutton, lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV b)).
2. Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
3. Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Argentina's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected. 4. If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year. The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina's export entitlement for the following year.
5. The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 %, ad valorem. (1)Carcass weight (bone-in equivalent weight). By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
6. At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Argentina, will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2, in accordance with Argentina's trade with each new Member State.
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in point 5 of this arrangement being taken into account.
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 23 000 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community.
7. The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed. In particular, the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb.
8. In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products. These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
9. Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Argentina, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
10. A consultative committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Argentina. The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly. It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities.
11. The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
12. The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December. The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade.
13. This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Argentine Republic.
14. The Agreement shall enter into force on 20 October 1980.
It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing. In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary.
I should be obliged if you would kindly confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing.
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
CHAPTER I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
SECTION 1
Principles of unity, budget accuracy, equilibrium and unit of account
Article 1
1. All items or revenue and expenditure of the Centre shall be included in estimates to be based on a costed annual work programme to be drawn up for each financial year and shall be entered in the budget.
2. The revenue and expenditure shown in the budget shall be in balance.
Article 2
The budget shall be established and implemented in euro and the accounts shall be presented in euro. However, for its management needs, the Centre is authorised to carry out operations in the national currencies of EU Member States and ACP States.
Article 3
1. Revenue shall include the contribution by the European Development Fund (hereinafter referred to as EDF), the amount levied in taxes on the salaries, wages and other emoluments paid by the Centre, and other miscellaneous receipts.
2. Revenue may also include contributions from other donors to the budget of the Centre.
3. The Centre is also authorised to manage resources on behalf of third parties and intended to co-finance activities defined in Annex III of the Agreement. The financial rules applicable to the management of these resources are set out in Article 34 of this Decision.

Article 5
1. The financial year shall run from 1 January to 31 December.
2. Appropriations entered in the budget shall be authorised for a period of one financial year.
However, appropriations duly committed during a financial year but not paid by 31 December of that year shall be carried over automatically to the following financial year. Appropriations which have been carried over to the following financial year shall be distinguished in the accounts of the current year.
Appropriations decommitted at the end of a financial year shall be transferred to the five-year period allocation planned for the Centre in the Agreement.
3. At the end of each Financial Protocol to the Agreement, appropriations committed but not paid shall be carried over automatically to the next Financial Protocol to the Agreement. Appropriations committed but not paid at the end of the Agreement shall be carried over only during the transitional period between the Agreement and the next Agreement or, where appropriate, during the settlement period of 12 months.
4. If, at the beginning of a financial year, the budget has not yet been adopted, the Director may, in order to ensure the continuity of the Centre's operations, incur monthly expenses on condition that they do not exceed one-twelfth of the appropriations entered under the relevant article in the budget for the previous financial year.
However, for the operating expenses payable quarterly in advance and approved in the previous financial year's budget, the commitment operations may be implemented per article provided they do not exceed a quarter of the overall appropriations authorised for the previous financial year.
SECTION 2
Principles of sound financial management
Article 6
1. Budget appropriations shall be used in accordance with sound financial management, that is to say based on the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
2. The principle of economy requires that resources should be made available in good time and as cost-effectively as possible, and that means should be appropriate in terms of quantity and quality.
The principle of efficiency requires the means implemented to be directly proportional to the results obtained.
The principle of effectiveness is concerned with attaining the specific objective set and achieving the intended results.
3. Objectives should be clearly defined and their implementation monitored with the help of measurable indicators. Where appropriate, projects to be funded from EDF resources should be supported by ex-ante assessments. The result of those assessments shall be included in the documents submitted to the Commission in support of the annual EDF contribution requested by the Centre.
CHAPTER II
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BUDGET
Article 7
1. In the framework of the overall strategy paper and within the limits of the overall budget allocated to the Centre by the Financial Protocol, the Director shall prepare a draft annual work programme and budget. Those drafts shall be approved by the Executive Board no later than 1 July of the year prior to that of their implementation and shall be submitted to the Committee of Ambassadors for adoption.
2. The Centre shall transmit a copy of the draft annual work programme and budget to the Commission, which shall initiate the Community procedures necessary for their approval.
3. The budget shall be available for commitment as from the date on which the Community authority adopts the decision on the financing of the requested EDF contribution. The Centre shall be informed of that decision.
Article 8
1. The payment arrangements governing the EDF's contribution shall be set out in a grant agreement signed between the Commission and the Centre.
2. The contribution of previous financial years corresponding to cancelled appropriations shall be repaid to the EDF by the Centre on the basis of audited financial statements.
3. The budget shall be subdivided into titles (budget headings), chapters, articles and items according to the nature or purpose of the revenue or expenditure.
Article 9
Where necessary, the Director may submit a draft supplementary or amending budget which shall be established in the same form and subject to the same procedures as the budget whose estimates it amends.
CHAPTER III
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET
Article 10
1. The Director shall ensure that the budget is implemented on the Director's own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations allocated. The Director shall report on his management to the Executive Board.
2. The Director must apply the budget appropriations in accordance with the principles of sound financial management as referred to in Article 6.
Article 11
1. No revenue or expenditure may be effected unless charged to the appropriate article of the budget.
No expenditure may be committed or authorised in excess of the appropriations authorised for the financial year concerned or in excess of the appropriations carried over from the previous financial year.
2. Revenue and expenditure shall be entered in full in the accounts without any adjustment against each other.
By way of derogation from that rule, the following shall be deducted from the amounts authorised:
(a) fines imposed on a party to a contract;
(b) adjustment of amounts paid in error, which may be achieved by means of deduction when a subsequent validation is effected under the chapter, article and financial year in respect of which the excess payment was made;
(c) the value of vehicles, equipment and installations taken in part exchange upon purchase of new items of the same kind; the net purchase price shall be entered in the accounts at historical cost for the valuation of the inventory;
(d) the discounts deducted from invoices and accounts.
Also by way of derogation from that rule, the following amounts may be reused against the same category (line) of the initial expense:
(a) refunds of amounts paid in error;
(b) insurance payments received;
(c) proceeds from the sale of vehicles, equipment and installations disposed of when replaced;
(d) the receipts obtained from the sale of publications and films;
(e) the exchange rate differences recorded during budgetary implementation may be offset. The final result, whether positive or negative, shall appear in the financial statement.

Article 13
The revenue of the Centre shall be paid into one or more accounts opened in the name of the Centre.
CHAPTER IV
FINANCIAL CONTROL
Article 14
1. A financial controller appointed by the Executive Board shall be responsible for the prior approval of the commitment and authorisation of all items of expenditure, revenue and advances.
2. The financial controller shall have proven experience in financial regulations of international organisations and auditing.
3. The financial controller shall be subject to the conditions of employment of the staff of the Centre. As such, he shall report, for administrative purposes, to the Director of the Centre. However, any measure relating to disciplinary action, suspension, termination of service or legal proceedings shall be adopted by the Executive Board on the basis of a reasoned proposal by the Director.
4. The checks performed by the financial controller shall result in the granting or refusal of endorsement. The purpose of endorsement shall be to ensure that:
(a) the expenditure or revenue is consistent with the budget and the regulations;
(b) the principles of sound financial management referred to in Article 6 have been applied.
The checks shall be performed in accordance with rules of internal procedure submitted by the Director to the Executive Board and approved by the latter.
5. Refusals to endorse shall be the subject of a written statement of reasons addressed to the Director. Unless the reason is lack of sufficient appropriations, the Director may, by means of a reasoned decision and under his own responsibility, disregard the financial controller's refusal to endorse. The Director shall inform the Executive Board in writing of any such decisions at its next meeting.
6. The financial controller shall have access to all supporting documentation and any other documents relating to expenditure or revenue to be checked. The financial controller may carry out checks on the spot.
7. The financial controller shall enjoy full independence in the performance of his duties. The financial controller shall receive no instructions and shall be subject to no restrictions in the performance of his duties.
8. The Director may request the financial controller's opinion on matters relating to the analysis, organisation and improvement of the Centre's internal procedures. The Director may also ask the financial controller to review documents to ascertain whether operations financed by the budget were carried out properly.
9. At the end of each financial year, and by 30 April of the following year at the latest, the financial controller shall draw up an annual report giving an opinion on the financial administration and implementation of the budget. The financial controller shall forward this report to the Director, who shall submit it with his own comments to the Executive Board at its next meeting.
CHAPTER V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE BUDGET
Article 15
1. The budget of the Centre shall be administered in accordance with the principle that authorising officers and accounting officers fulfil separate functions.

3. Copies of the supporting documents, certified as true copies by the authorising officer, may, in some cases, be accepted in place of the originals.

When payments are suspended, the Director may require in writing, and on his own responsibility, that payment be effected. In such cases, the Director shall inform the Executive Board in writing at its next meeting.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Article 54 (2) and (3) and Article 63 (2) and (3) thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment (1) and in particular Titles IV A and C thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom to provide services (2) and in particular Title V C thereof;
Having regard to Council Directive No 64/233/EEC (3) of 25 February 1964 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities related to wholesale trade;
Having regard to Council Directive No 64/224/EEC (4) of 25 February 1964 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (6);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (7);
Whereas the General Programmes provide for the abolition of all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and provisions of services - in the area of activities of wholesale trade of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries, before the end of the second year of the second stage,
- in the area of activities of retail trade, after the end of the second year of the second stage of the transitional period and before the end of the second stage;
Whereas Directives No 64/223/EEC, No 64/224/EEC and No 68/363/EEC do not apply to the field of toxic products, the latter, on account of the particular problems posed by protection of public health, are governed by the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States;
Whereas Directives No 64/223/EEC and No 68/363/EEC mentioned above also do not apply to activities in respect of wholesale trade, intermediaries and retail trade of pathogens ; whereas, however, besides pathogens classified as medicinal preparations for human or animal use in the sense of Council Directive No 65/65/EEC (8) of 26 January 1965, on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to proprietary medicinal products, amended by Directive No 66/454/EEC (9) only pathogens called %quot%biological pesticides for use in agriculture%quot% form the subject of the activities mentioned ; whereas therefore, with regard to pathogens, the abolition of restrictions on freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment can be limited to trade and the distribution of such pesticides;
Whereas it has become evident that it is desirable and timely to take measures to regulate on a Community level the measures referred to in the two preceding recitals, taking into account the dangerous action which toxic products may have on the health of man, animals, and plants, either directly or indirectly through the environment;
Whereas the activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries are the subject of Directives No 64/224/EEC and No 68/363/EEC; whereas the activities of intermediaries in respect of toxic products and pathogens are excluded from the (1)OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.

scope of these Directives ; whereas this Directive is also designed to liberalize the activities of intermediaries ; whereas accordingly the terms %quot%trade and distribution%quot% in this Directive include also the activities of intermediaries in these fields;
Whereas the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment provides that restrictions on the power to exercise the right to join professional or trade organizations must be abolished where the professional activities of the person concerned involve the exercise of this power;
Whereas this position of paid employees accompanying a person providing services or acting on his behalf will be governed by the provisions laid down in pursuance of Articles 48 and 49 of the Treaty; Whereas separate Directives, applicable to all activities of self-employed persons, concerning the movement and residence of beneficiaries, and where necessary Directives on the coordination of the safeguards required by Member States of companies or firms for the protection of members and of others, have been or will be adopted;
Whereas in some Member States trade, distribution and professional use of toxic products are governed by rules relating to the taking up of that profession, while other States will, where necessary, implement such rules ; whereas, therefore, certain special transitional measures, the purpose of which is to make it easier for nationals of other Member States to take up and pursue activities in the trade of toxic products, are the subject of a separate Directive,

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 3 December 1987 amending Directive 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from the engines of motor vehicles (88/76/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100A thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas it is important to adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992 ; whereas the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;
Whereas the first programme of action of the European Communities on the protection of the environment, approved by the Council on 22 November 1973, called for account to be taken of the latest scientific advances in combating atmospheric pollution caused by gases emitted from motor vehicles and for Directives adopted previously to be amended accordingly ; whereas the third programme of action provides for additional efforts to be made to reduce considerably the present level of emissions of pollutants from motor vehicles;
Whereas Directive 70/220/EEC (4) lays down the limit values for carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions from such engines ; whereas these limit values were first reduced by Directive 74/290/EEC (5) and supplemented, in accordance with Directive 77/102/EEC (6), by limit values for permissible emissions of nitrogen oxides ; whereas the limit values for these three pollutants were successively reduced by Directives 78/665/EEC (7) and 83/351/EEC (8);
Whereas the work undertaken by the Commission in connection with its policy of pursuing a comprehensive approach to the development of rules for the motor vehicle industry has shown that the European industry already has available, or is currently perfecting, engine technology which will allow a further reduction in limit values ; whereas during the period under consideration such a reduction will not jeopardize the aims of Community policy in other fields, and in particular in that of the rational use of energy; (1) OJ No C 178, 6.7.1984, p. 9, OJ No C 318, 29.11.1984, p. 6, and OJ No C 257, 28.9.1987, p. 1.

(8) OJ No L 197, 20.7.1983, p. 1. Whereas it is necessary to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness respectively on the internal market and on foreign markets ; whereas it is necessary that the Community adopt measures on vehicle emissions ; whereas they should at the same time respect a high level of environmental protection and make it possible to achieve values adapted to European conditions so that their ultimate effect on the environment is equivalent to that of the standards for vehicle emissions in force in the United States of America ; whereas to achieve this objective, it is advisable to provide for a solution which varies according to the category of vehicle engine capacity so as to allow, as far as possible, compliance with Community requirements at a reasonable cost and using different technical means ; whereas the limit values laid down for vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1,4 litres reflect the current technical and economic conditions of European manufacturers in this section of the market ; whereas the limit values applicable in 1992/93 should be fixed in 1987;
Whereas the limit values in this Directive are based on the test method laid down in Directive 70/220/EEC, but this procedure must be adapted subsequently so that it is representative not only of traffic conditions in congested urban centres but also of those outside such centres ; whereas a decision concerning such adaptation should be taken by 1987 at the latest;
Whereas Article 5 of Directive 70/220/EEC refers to the possibility of adapting the provisions of the Annexes to take account of technical progress;
Whereas petrol engines in all vehicles covered by this Directive should be designed to run on unleaded petrol so as to make it possible to stop the use of lead-based additives in fuels and thus make a decisive contribution to the reduction of environmental pollution by that element;
Whereas it is necessary to ensure that the provisions relating to the compression-ignition engines of vehicles covered by this Directive remain compatible, in view of the specific nature of all the pollutants emitted by such engines, with subsequent changes in the provisions relating to the other pollutants emitted by such engines, referred to in Directive 72/306/EEC (1);
Whereas, during the period between the adoption of European standards and the implementation of the modified European test cycle, it is desirable that vehicles which obtain type-approval in accordance with equivalent standards on Community export markets should also qualify for EEC type-approval;
Whereas, with due regard for the rules of the Treaty, Member States which so wish may apply in advance the new values laid down in this Directive, on the understanding that if they do so they may not prohibit the marketing or use of vehicles, whether manufactured at home or imported, which comply with Community requirements,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

1. Member States may refuse national type-approval, EEC type-approval or the document provided for in the second indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC for a type of motor vehicle with a positive ignition engine whose engine fuel requirements do not meet the provisions of the Annexes to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by this Directive: - from 1 October 1988, for types of vehicle having an engine capacity greater than 2 000 cm3, except for those defined in section 8.1,
- from 1 October 1989, for the other types.
2. From 1 October 1990, Member States may prohibit the entry into service of vehicles fitted with a positive ignition engine whose fuel requirements do not meet the provisions of the Annexes to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by this Directive, except where the manufacturer provides a certificate accepted by the technical service which issued the initial emission type-approval stating that adapting such vehicles to the new fuel requirement entails major engineering changes, namely a change in material specification of the inlet or exhaust valve seats or a reduction in the compression ratio, or an increase in the engine capacity to compensate for power loss ; in which case, such a ban is possible only from the dates laid down in Article 2 (3).
Article 4
By 31 December 1987 at the latest, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall: - decide on a further reduction in the limit values to be applied to vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1400 cm3 at the latest in 1992 for the issue of new national type-approvals and 1993 for the entry of vehicles into service,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks (1), and in particular Article 6 (3) thereof,
Whereas detailed implementing rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks are laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 of 24 April 1990 (2); whereas, in order to protect from unfair competition certain terms added to the sales designation of a number of spirit drinks made by traditional methods, these terms should be restricted to the spirit drinks defined in the Annex to this Regulation;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Implementation Committee for Spirit Drinks,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1
Article 7a is hereby inserted in Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90:
'Article 7a

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2155/91 of 20 June 1991 laying down particular provisions for the application of Articles 37, 39 and 40 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation on direct insurance other than life assurance
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the last sentence of Article 57 (2) and Article 235 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas an Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation on direct insurance other than life assurance was signed at Luxembourg on 10 October 1989;
Whereas under that Agreement a Joint Committee is to be set up to administer the Agreement, ensure that
it is properly implemented and take decisions in the circumstances provided for therein; whereas the Community's representatives on the Joint Committee have to be designated and particular provisions have to be adopted

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3578/92 of 7 December 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 (4) provides that Member States may promote the development of combined transport by granting aid relating to investment in infrastructure and in the fixed and moveable facilities necessary for transhipment or to the running costs of an intra-Community combined transport service in transit across the territory of non-member countries;
Whereas the evolution of combined transport shows that for the Community as a whole the starting-up phase of this technology has not been completed yet, and whereas the aid arrangements should therefore be maintained for a further period;
Whereas the possibility of granting such aid for the running costs of combined transport services crossing the territory of a non-member country is warranted only in the specific cases of Austria, Switzerland and the States of the former Yugoslavia;
Whereas the need to achieve economic and social cohesion rapidly in the Community entails putting the emphasis on investment in rail and road facilities specific to combined transport, in particular where they present an aternative to infrastructure work that cannot be completed in the short term;
Whereas, in addition, providing aid for road facilities specific to combined transport would be an effective way of encouraging small and medium-sized undertakings to avail themselves of combined transport services;
Whereas aid for equipment specific to combined transport would foster the development of new bimodal and transhipment technology;
Whereas during a limited start-up phase the possibility of granting aid should therefore be extended to investment in transport facilities specifically designed for combined transport, provided that they are used exclusively for that purpose;
Whereas the present aid arrangements should be maintained in force until 31 December 1995 and the Council should decide, under the conditions laid down in the Treaty, on the arrangements to be applied subsequently or, if necessary, on the conditions for terminating such aid;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 should therefore be amended,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Item 1 (e) of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 is hereby replaced by the following:
'(e) until 31 December 1995, where the aids are granted as a temporary measure and are designed to facilitate the development of combined transport, such aids must relate to:
- investment in infrastructure, or
- investment in fixed and moveable facilities necessary for transhipment, or
- investment in transport equipment specifically designed for combined transport and used exclusively in combined transport, or
- costs of running combined transport services in transit across Austria, Switzerland or the States of the former Yugoslavia.
The Commission shall submit a progress report on the above measures to the Council every two years giving details, inter alia, of the destination of the aids, their amount and their impact on combined transport. Member States shall supply the Commission with the information needed to compile the report.
By 31 December 1995 the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide under the conditions laid down in the Treaty, on the arrangements to be applied subsequently or, if necessary, on the conditions for terminating them.'
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
It shall apply from 1 January 1993. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
COMMISSION DECISION of 21 December 1992 setting up a scientific committee for designations of origin, geographical indications and certificates of specific character
(93/53/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Whereas within the framework of Community protection of designations of origin and geographical indications, registration thereof may involve examining problems concerning the generic nature of a name and the factors to be taken into account when defining the designation of origin and geographical indication for agricultural products and foodstuffs, on the one hand, and the application of criteria regarding fair competition in commercial transactions and the danger of confusing consumers within the meaning of Articles 13 and 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 (1) in cases where there is a conflict between the designation of origin or geographical indication and the trademark, homonyms or existing products which are legally marketed, on the other hand;
Whereas within the framework of Community protection of certificates of specific character, registration thereof may involve examining problems concerning assessment of the traditional nature of agricultural products and foodstuffs;
Whereas the search for solutions to such problems requires the assistance of highly qualified experts with legal or agricultural backgrounds, and particularly with knowledge of intellectual property rights;
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to set up a scientific committee to assist the Commission,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1718/93 of 30 June 1993 regarding the operative event for the agricultural conversion rates used in the seeds sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,
Whereas the aid introduced by Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organization of the market in seeds (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3695/92 (3), may be granted in respect of the products referred to in the Annex to the said Regulation;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1546/75 of 18 June 1975 defining the event in which the aid in respect of seeds becomes due and payable (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2811/86 (5), defines the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate on the basis of legal criteria and provisions which have been fundamentally modified by the new agrimonetary arrangements introduced in Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92; whereas, in accordance with the new provisions, the event by means of which the economic objective is attained occurs during harvest and may therefore be considered to be 1 August of each marketing year; whereas, therefore, that date is the date of the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to aid to seed producers;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The rate to be applied for the purposes of the aid provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 shall be the agricultural conversin rate in force on 1 August of the marketing year in respect of which the aid is due.
Article 2
Regulation (EEC) No 1546/75 is hereby repealed.
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1993.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2861/93 of 18 October 1993 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5%quot% microdisks) originating in Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 920/93 (2), hereinafter referred to as the 'provisional Regulation', imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain magnetic disks (hereinafter referred to as 3,5%quot% microdisks) originating in Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, and falling within CN code ex 8523 20 90. The duty was extended for a maximum period of two months by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2206/93 (3).
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (2) Subsequent to the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the interested parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. Certain of these parties also presented written submissions making known their views on the findings.
(3) Two importers, which had not cooperated in the investigation, made written representations to the Commission following the introduction of the provisional anti-dumping duty. One of them requested, and was granted, a hearing.
(4) Upon request, parties were informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of provisional duty. They were also granted a reasonable period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.
(5) The oral and written comments presented by the parties were considered, and, where appropriate, the Commission's findings were modified to take account of them.
(6) Because of the volume and complexity of the data examined, the investigation could not be concluded within the time limit provided for in Article 7 (9) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
C. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION/LIKE PRODUCT (7) As no new arguments have been presented regarding the product under consideration and the like product, the Council adopts the findings of the Commission as set out in recitals 7 to 12 of the provisional Regulation.
D. INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT OF CHINESE EXPORTERS (8) Several producers in the People's Republic of China reiterated their request that the Commission make individual company findings for each of them, without, however, presenting any evidence additional to that submitted prior to the provisional findings and referred to at recital 13 of the provisional Regulation.
The Commission recalls, in this respect, that individual treatment is not a requirement of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. Indeed, the grant of individual treatment to some of these producers may affect or even distort, the outcome of the calculation of the country-wide anti-dumping duty. In addition, it is, in practice, extremely difficult to establish, in the case of a country such as the People's Republic of China, whether a company really enjoys, both legally and in fact, independence from the State and, in particular, whether a company has permanent independence where it appears to enjoy independence at a certain point in time.
Finally, since the grant of individual treatment may cause inappropriate levels of duty to be imposed and gives rise to an opportunity for the State to circumvent anti-dumping measures by channelling through the exporter with the lowest duty, the Commission has come to the conclusion that departures from the general rule whereby a single anti-dumping duty is established for State-trading countries should be made only where it is completely satisfied that the effectiveness of the measures is not undermined.
In the provisional Regulation, the facts established for Hanny Magnetics (Zuhai) Ltd during the Commission's investigation demonstrated that this company is free of government intrusion in the execution of its business operations, and individual treatment was granted. In the light of the principle of legitimate expectations and legal certainty, the Commission considers that the individual treatment granted to this company should be maintained. Furthermore, given the small difference found in the dumping margin for this producer and that applicable to the other producers, the risk of circumvention is minimal.
The findings at the said recital 13 are thus maintained.
(9) The Council confirms the Commission's findings.
E. DUMPING 1. Normal value
(10) For the purpose of the definitive findings, normal value was, in general, established on the basis of the same methods as those used in the provisional determination of dumping, after taking into consideration new facts and arguments presented by the parties.
(11) Following publication of the provisional Regulation, one Taiwanese producer claimed that the normal value established should have been based on the prices of all sales of the like product on the domestic market, including sales made at a loss.
As stated in recital 18 of the provisional Regulation, normal value in Taiwan for this producer was established in accordance with Article 2 (3) (a) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, on the basis of the price actually paid in the ordinary course of trade for domestic sales of the like product, which were made in sufficient quantities to permit a proper comparison.
However, it was found that the majority of its domestic sales of one product type were made at a substantial loss. The Commission had, therefore, to exlude from the determination of normal value the sales of this product type, the prices of which did not permit recovery, in the normal course of trade in the investigation period, of all costs reasonably allocated.
As regards the other product type, the producer in question was able to show that its prices for sales of this product were sufficiently profitable as to be considered in the ordinary course of trade over the investigation period. Accordingly, normal value for this type was established by reference to these prices.
(12) The Chinese producer referred to in recital 21 of the provisional Regulation argued that the normal value established on the basis of an analogous third market economy, i.e. Taiwan, should be adjusted to reflect the lower manufacturing cost structure in China.
The Commission cannot accept this argument. To make allowances for alleged differences in cost structures in a State-trading country would involve the need to rely on that country's costs of production, in particular its labour, utility and transport costs, property changes, and other inputs, which are not determined by market forces and would, therefore, not permit a proper comparison.
(13) The Council confirms these findings and those set out at recitals 15 to 23 of the provisional Regulation concerning normal value.
2. Export price
(14) One Taiwanese producer claimed that, in its calculation of export prices, the Commission, for reasons of equity, should have excluded export sales made to complainant Community producers.
The Commission could not, however, accept any such exclusion, as the sales in question satisfied the provisions of Article 2 (8) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 regarding the determination of export prices. Indeed, not only is such an exclusion not provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, but the reliability of these prices is unaffected, in the present case, by the status of the customer involved.
The related problem of self-inflicted injury is addressed in recital 28 below.
(15) The Council confirms this view and the findings on export prices set out in recital 24 to 28 of the provisional Regulation.
3. Comparison
(16) The Chinese producer referred to in recital 31 of the provisional Regulation claimed that the adjustment to normal value made for differences in physical characteristics of the uncertified diskettes sold for export did not reflect the full value of these differences.
The Commission has examined this question. It has noted that the purchaser incurs a certain risk from the purchase of uncertified diskettes, and, consequently, an adjustment should be made to reflect the differences in physical characteristics. However, this producer was unable to provide new evidence substantiating the additional claim. In these circumstances, the Commission considers that the adjustment provisionally made fully reflected the differences in physical characteristics established. Consequently, the claim for an additional adjustment was rejected.
(17) Several other Chinese producers and one Taiwanese producer claimed that, in the comparison of normal value on the Taiwanese market with export price, no adjustment had been made to reflect the differences in direct selling expenses for sales to OEM customers on the export market and for sales to non-OEM customers on the domestic market. In its examination of the situation of the Taiwanese producer which made domestic sales in sufficient quantities to permit a proper comparison, the Commission found no indication that there was any difference in selling expenses incurred and profit realized in different channels of sale. No adjustment in this respect, therefore, could be made.
4. Dumping margins
(18) On the basis of the modifications made to the calculations of normal value and export price, the definitive dumping margins calculated by the Commission, expressed as a percentage of the cif value, established in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1224/80 of 28 May 1980 on the valuation of goods for customs purposes (4), for each of the companies concerned, are as follows:
Japan
Memorex Telex Japan Ltd 49,0 %
Hitachi Maxell Ltd 32,8 %
TDK Ltd 44,8 %
Sony Ltd 60,1 %
Taiwan
CIS Technology Ltd 19,8 %
Megamedia Ltd 32,7 %
China
Hanny Magnetics (Zuhai) Ltd 35,6 %
Other companies 39,4 %.
(19) As far as non-cooperating producers are concerned, no comments on the conclusions reached by the Commission in recital 37 of the provisional Regulation were received. In these circumstances, the Council confirms these findings, and the dumping margin for non-cooperating producers is set at the level of the respective highest dumping margins.
F. COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (20) Producers in Japan and the People's Republic of China challenged the Commission's finding in recitals 39 to 47 of the provisional Regulation that the five complainant producers represented a major proportion of Community production of 3,5%amp% prime;%amp% prime; microdisks, and could therefore be considered the Community industry in terms of Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. They argued, in particular, that the output of the producers in the Community found to be related to the producers in the countries subject to the proceeding should have been included in total Community production, when calculating whether the output of the five complainant producers constituted a major proportion of total Community production of the product in question.
In this context, the Commission recalls that it is the consistent practice of the Community institutions that total Community production can only be considered as meaning the output of those Community producers which are not excluded for the reasons given in the first indent of the said Article 4 (5). The output of producers which are excluded from the definition of Community industry because of their relationship to exporters should, therefore, be excluded, a fortiori, from total Community production, when determining whether the Community industry represents a major proportion of such production.
The rationale of Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 is indeed that, for the determination of injury, it should not be open to producers found to be related to exporters to seek relief from unfair trading practices, since they may, through this relationship, have participated in, or benefited from, injurious dumping. It is only by excluding such producers, where appropriate, that the Community institutions can obtain an undistorted and objective view of the effects of the dumped imports. Were this not the case, then, in addition to contributing to the injury, producers related to exporters of otherwise benefiting from dumping would be in a position to hinder complainant Community producers in their attempts, or even block such attempts, to seek legitimate relief against the injury caused by dumped imports.
The Commission, therefore, maintains its findings at recitals 39 to 47, of the provisional Regulation, that producers in the Community related to producers in Japan should be excluded from the Community industry and that, on this basis, production of 3,5%amp% prime;%amp% prime; microdisks by the complainant producers represented around 77 % of total Community production during the investigation period.
(21) The Council confirms these findings.
G. INJURY 1. Cumulation of the effects of the dumped imports
(22) Some Japanese producers contested the Commission's findings on cumulation at recitals 50 to 52 of the provisional Regulation. However, no new arguments or facts were presented. The Council confirms the aforementioned Commission findings.
2. Prices of dumped imports
(23) One Japanese producer and producers in the People's Republic of China queried the basis for the Commission's statement at recital 56 of the provisional Regulation that the prices of imported 3,5%amp% Prime; microdisks had, in many cases, decreased by more than 75 % between 1988 and the investigation period.
The Commission has reviewed the information available to it in respect of export price trends since 1988. Prices declined substantially, varying by company and by product type, by between 23 and 79 %.
Furtermore, by comparing the prices realized at the beginning and the end of the investigation period, price declines of 13 % on average for unbranded 3,5%amp% Prime; microdisks and 31 % for branded 3,5%amp% Prime; microdisks were found over this 12-month period.
(24) One Japanese producer claimed that in establishing price undercutting, the Commission should have taken account of the fact that its sales to an exclusive distributor on the French market by its German subsidiary were made at a different level of trade to that of the relevant Community industry sales.
Following the claim from the Japanese producer concerned, the Commission has reviewed the undercutting calculations for this producer.
This producer provided no evidence, however, to substantiate that the tasks or activities of the distributor in France were any different from other distributors in the Community. In these circumstances, the Commission has, for this producer, established prices to distributors and compared these with prices for sales to distributors by the Community industry. In addition, prices to other categories of customer were also compared at the same level.
The result of the revised comparison of prices reveal an undercutting margin still within the range mentioned in recital 55 of the provisional Regulation.
(25) The Council confirms these findings, and those in recital 55 of the provisional Regulation.
3. Situation of the Community industry
(26) As no new arguments or information were put forward, the Council confirms the Commission's findings as set out in recitals 56 to 61 of the provisional Regulation on the situation of the Community industry, and those related to injury at recital 62.
H. CAUSATION (27) Two Japanese producers, on the grounds that the market share taken by imports from Japan had fallen considerably over the period concerned, disputed the Commission's conclusion contained in recital 66 of the provisional Regulation, that the effects of imports from third countries not covered by the proceeding did not alter the fact that the dumped imports concerned from Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, taken in isolation, caused material injury to the Community industry. These producers, therefore, requested that the effect of imports from Japan should not be examined cumulatively with those from the other countries concerned.
The Commission recalls that it has been the consistent practice of the Community institutions, upheld by the European Court of Justice, to examine the effect of the dumped imports as a whole, except where the level of dumped imports from a given country is negligible or otherwise does not contribute to injury.
The Commission, in recital 54 of the provisional Regulation, acknowledge that imports into the Community of 3,5%amp% tprime; microdisks from Japan fell between 1988 and the investigation period.
However, at 22 %, their market share remained substantial, and was almost double that of the Community industry.
Furthermore, the dumped imports from the three countries concerned, viewed cumulatively, attained a market share of 33,8 % in the investigation period. This, together with the substantial price depression arising from the price undercutting by these dumped imports, could not fail to have had a marked negative effect on the situation of the Community industry, which had only recently been established.
The Commission, therefore, maintains the findings at the said recital 66.
(28) Two Japanese producers questioned the Commission's recognition of under-utilization of capacity as an indicator of material injury at recital 57 of the provisional Regulation, while, at the same time, complainant Community producers were importing sometimes substantial quantities of the product concerned from the countries covered by the proceeding. Hence, the Community industry was inflicting injury upon itself.
As pointed out in recital 43 of the provisional Regulation, imports of 3,5%amp% Prime; microdisks by all but one of the Community producers represented only a small proportion of their sales in the investigation period. Therefore, the arguments presented by the Japanese are not supported by the facts.
It shoud be noted that the complainant producer which had a substantial level of imports also had a high capacity utilization rate. No contradiction thus exists between the Commission's recognition of general capacity under-utilization and imports of 3,5%amp% Prime; microdisks. The imports were a consequence of the fact that, due to the effects of low-priced imports from the countries concerned, the producer in question had been unable to generate the investment funds needed to develop a production capacity sufficient to meet demand in the Community. At the time, this producer had no other reasonable choice but to act in self-defence, and did not therefore inflict injury on itself.
(29) The Council confirms the Commission's findings regarding causality and the injury attributable to other factors, and those contained in recitals 64 to 74 of the provisional Regulation.
I. COMMUNITY INTEREST (30) Two Japanese producers argued that the imposition of duties at a time of shortage of supply on the Community market, with the Community industry unable to meet demand, would serve only to raise costs and prices, to the detriment of duplicators and consumers.
In recital 78 of the provisional Regulation, the Commission recognized that production by the Community industry is currently insufficient to meet the surge in demand that recently occurred in the Community market. Nevertheless, the Community industry, in an appropriate response to this development, has, since the end of the investigation period, acted to increase production capacity, and, given the respite afforded by anti-dumping duties from the pricing pressures caused by unfairly traded imports, can be expected to continue to invest in this sector. Moreover, new Community producers, in a further response to the market, have set up production facilities in the Community. The Commission considers it essential that the complainant Community industry and these new independent Community producers be given the opportunity to attain, in conditions of fair trade undistorted by dumping, the levels of profitability needed for economic viability. The Commission therefore maintains its findings on Community interest as set out in recitals 75 to 80 of the provisional Regulation.
(31) One importer argued that the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty would only increase costs to users without, in any way, helping the Community industry, as producers and exporters in countries not subject to the duty would take advantage of the higher prices engendered to increase market shares at prices below those needed by the Community industry.
The Commission notes, however, that the purpose of the present proceeding is to address problems arising from the dumped imports from the countries concerned. It is not the purpose of anti-dumping measures to protect the Community industry from the normal operation of fair competition, in conditions of which there should be unhindered market access.
(32) As no other arguments were presented, the Council confirms these conclusions and those set out in recitals 75 to 85 of the provisional Regulation.
J. DUTY (33) In the provisional determination, the Commission established the amount of duty necessary to remove the injury on the basis of full costs of production plus a 10 % return on sales. The complainant argued that the use of a profit margin of 10 % is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for investments to increase production capacity, marketing expenditure, and research and development of new products, and that the Commission should use a profit margin between 12 and 16 % of turnover to calculate the increase in prices necessary to remove the injury.
(34) The Commission maintains its argument that, in respect of the relevant costs in the period covered by the investigation, it would have been unrealistic to export profit margins for the Community industry above the 10 % considered to be the minimum required to ensure the viability of that industry.
(35) One Japanese producer argued that, because of its calculation of the duty required to remove injury, the Commission had attributed to the producers in the countries concerned not only that part of any injury suffered by the Community industry caused by imports from these countries, but also the injury caused by other factors, notably by imports from countries not subject to the proceeding.
The Commission rejects this contention.
In its overall assessment of the situation, the Commission examined all potential causes of injury, to ensure that factors other than imports from Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China were not in fact responsible for the injury suffered by the Community industry. This examination covered, as pointed out in recital 66 of the provisional Regulation, imports from third countries not included in the proceeding, and it was found that, even if some of the injury could have been attributed to these imports, this did not alter the fact that the injury caused by the dumped imports from the countries subject to the proceeding was, taken in isolation, material.
Furthermore, in line with consistent Community practice, the Commission has acted to remove the injury established by imposing duties only up to the limit of the dumping margins or the margins of underselling individually determined for producers found to be dumping. It is clear, therefore, that by adopting this approach, the Commission does not remove more injury than that caused by each exporter by its dumped imports, and does not, therefore, attribute to the dumped imports any element of injury that may have been caused by other factors.
(36) The difference between the prices for the Community industry, established in accordance with the method outlined in recital 81 of the provisional Regulation, and the prices of the dumped imports used to establish undercutting, as outlined in recital 55 of the provisional Regulation, as adapted by recital 27 of this Regulation, expressed on a weighted average basis and as a percentage of the free-at-Community-frontier price, established in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1224/80, were above the dumping margins found for all the producers in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, and ranged from 6,1 to 40,9 % for producers in Japan.
As far as non-cooperating producers are concerned, the Commission considers that the result of its investigation forms the most appropriate basis for the establishment of the level of duty, and thus concludes that the highest level of duty determined for a producer in the same country shall be applied to the non-cooperating producers.
(37) The Council confirms the above findings of the Commission and the determination of the duty to be applied, as described in recitals 81 to 85 of the provisional Regulation.
K. UNDERTAKINGS (38) Several producers have made undertaking proposals, and have been informed that the Commission is unable to accept undertakings in this case. In effect, the Commission considers that the degree of non-cooperation in the proceeding, the rapidity of technological change in the product, and the volatility of prices, would render the observance of undertakings exceedingly difficult to monitor. In addition, the high level of mobility of the production facilities in the industry would be unlikely to contribute to the restoration of fair competitive conditions in the market.
(39) Given the above, the Council concludes that measures should be imposed in the form of definitive anti-dumping duties.
L. COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL DUTIES (40) In view of the dumping margins established, the injury caused to the Community industry and of the latter's precarious financial situation, the Council considers it necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty for all companies should be collected definitively. Where the provisional duty exceeds the duty rate definitively imposed, the amount collected should not exceed that of the definitive anti-dumping duty,

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/94 (2), and in particular Article 9 (6) thereof,
Whereas Article 2 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2054/89 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3821/92 (4), lays down the terms under which the weighted average of resale prices of dried grapes is considered to be the import price; whereas, in order to prevent any artificial reduction in protection, provision should be made for customs import charges corresponding to entry and indirect taxes actually paid on importation to be deducted from the resale prices recorded; whereas Article 2 (6) of that Regulation defines 'end user'; whereas manufacturers who put up the product in immediate packings cannot be covered by the term since even if such packaging and presentation results in a change in the CN code, it cannot be considered processing for the purposes of this Regulation;
Whereas Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2054/89 provides for a special control procedure; whereas experience shows that where that procedure is applied, the release for free circulation of the goods should only be authorized once the security laid down in Article 248 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (5) has been lodged, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2193/94 (6); whereas that security must be demanded if the customs authorities have doubts as to the authenticity of the import price, even prior to the checks provided for in the said Article 248; whereas, in the case of a posteriori checks, it should be made clear that steps are being taken to recover duties owed in accordance with Article 220 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Communtiy Customs Code (7); whereas, in addition, it should be made clear that interest is payable on duties owed under all control procedures;
Whereas Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2054/89 lays down the terms under which the minimum import price may be deemed to be observed; whereas experience shows that, to avoid distortion, account must to be taken of the customs import charges actually paid and of the cost of any treatment the imported product undergoes after importation and prior to sale to the end user;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 2054/89 is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 2 is amended as follows:
(a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
'3. Where it is found that prices on resale, directly or via commercial intermediaries, are, after deduction of the customs import duties actually paid, less than the minimum price as regards more than 15 % of any consignment imported, the weighted average of those adjusted prices shall be deemed the import price.';
(b) paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:
'6. For the purposes of this Regulation, the end user shall mean either a manufacturer who uses the product in question with a view to processing it, otherwise than by packaging it, into a product covered by a CN code other than that shown in the declaration of release for free circulation, or a retailer selling exclusively to consumers.';
2. Article 6 is replaced by the following:
'Article 6
1. Where the customs authorities have well-founded doubts that the price shown in the declaration of release for free circulation reflects the actual import price, they shall authorize release for free circulation only after the importer has lodged the security referred to in Article 248 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 plus interest for the period of six months referred to in the second subparagraph. The rate of interest applicable shall be that in force under national law for the recovery of sums due.
Importers shall have six months within which to prove that the product has been disposed of under conditions which guarantee observance of the minimum import price. Failure to comply with the time limit shall entail the loss of the security, without prejudice to paragraph 2.
2. The time limit laid down in paragraph 1 may be extended by the competent authorities by up to three months on a duly justified application by the importer and provided that the security is adjusted accordingly.';
3. Article 7 (1) is replaced by the following:
'1. The minimum import price shall be deemed to be observed if the importer furnishes proof in respect of at least 95 % of the consignment imported that, at all marketing stages including sale to end users, the product has been sold at a price at least equal to the minimum import price after deduction of customs import charges actually paid. If the product undergoes treatment after its release for free circulation and before its sale to the end user, the cost of such treatment shall be reflected in the selling price to the end user.';
4. Article 10 is replaced by the following:
'Article 10
Where, in the course of a check, the competent authorities find that the minimum import price has not been observed, they shall collect the duties owed in accordance with Article 220 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92. In establishing the amount of the duties to be recovered or remaining to be recovered, they shall take account of interest incurred from the date of release for free circulation of the goods until that of recovery. The rate of interest applied shall be that in force under national law for the recovery of the sums due.'

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 95/7/EC of 10 April 1995 amending Directive 77/388/EEC and introducing new simplification measures with regard to value added tax - scope of certain exemptions and practical arrangements for implementing them
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee,
Whereas the operation of the internal market can be improved by introducing common rules clarifying the scope of, and arrangements for, applying some of the exemptions provided for in Articles 14 (1), 15, point 2, and 16 (1) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (1); whereas the introduction of such common rules is provided for by the aforesaid Directive, and in particular Articles 14 (2) and 16 (3) thereof;
Whereas Article 3 of Council Directive 92/111/EEC of 14 December 1992 amending Directive 77/388/EEC and introducing simplification measures with regard to value added tax (2) provides for the adoption of special rules for the taxation of chain transactions between taxable persons; whereas such rules must ensure not only compliance with the principle of neutrality of the common system of value added tax as regards the origin of goods and services but also compliance with the choices made as to the principles governing value added tax and its monitoring arrangements during the transitional period;
Whereas it is appropriate to include in the taxable amount on importation all ancillary costs arising from the transport of goods to any place of destination in the Community since that place is known at the time the importation is carried out; whereas, as a result, the supplies of services in question enjoy the exemptions provided for in Article 14 (1) (i) of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas Article 15 (2) of that Directive provides that the Commission shall submit to the Council proposals to establish Community tax rules specifying the scope of, and practical arrangements for implementing, the export exemptions applicable to supplies of goods carried in the personal luggage of travellers;
Whereas it is appropriate that the period serving as a basis for calculating the adjustments provided for by Article 20 (2) of the said Directive should be extended up to 20 years by Member States for immovable property acquired as capital goods, bearing in mind the duration of their economic life;
Whereas Member States should be enabled to maintain the rate applicable to goods after making up work which they carried out under a contract to make up work on 1 January 1993;
Whereas the rules governing territorial application and the tax arrangements applicable in the field of intra-Community goods-transport services function in a simple and satisfactory manner for both traders and the authorities in the Member States;
Whereas, by treating a transport operation within a Member State as an intra-Community goods-transport operation where it is directly linked to a transport operation between Member States, it is possible to simplify not only the principles and arrangements for taxing those domestic transport services but also the rules applicable to ancillary services and to services supplied by intermediaries involved in the supply of these various services;
Whereas the qualification of certain works on movable property as work carried out under a contract to make up work is a source of difficulty and should be eliminated;
Whereas, with a view to facilitating intra-Community trade in the field of work on movable tangible property, the tax arrangements applicable for these transactions should be modified when they are carried out for a person who is identified for value added tax purposes in a Member State other than that of their physical execution;
Whereas Article 16 (1) (B) to (E) of the said Directive, taken together in particular with Article 22 (9) concerning release from obligations, makes it possible to overcome the difficulties encountered by traders participating in transaction chains involving goods placed and kept under warehousing arrangements;
Whereas it is necessary in this connection to ensure that the tax treatment applied to supplies of goods and the provision of services relating to certain of the goods which may be placed under customs warehousing arrangements can also be applied to the same transactions involving goods placed under warehousing arrangements other than customs warehousing;
Whereas these transactions concern principally raw materials and other goods negotiated on international forward markets; whereas a list of the goods covered by these provisions should be drawn up;
Whereas, subject to consultation of the Committee on Value Added Tax, the Member States are responsible for defining those warehousing arrangements other than customs warehousing; whereas it is necessary nevertheless to exclude in principle from such arrangements goods that are intended to be supplied at the retail stage;
Whereas it is necessary to clarify some of the rules for applying tax when goods cease to be covered by the arrangements provided for in Article 16 (1) (B) to (E) of the said Directive, particularly as regards the person liable for payment of the tax due;
Whereas it is necessary to clarify the scope of those provisions of Article 17 (2) (a) of the said Directive that are applicable during the transitional period referred to in Article 28 l;
Whereas it is accordingly necessary to amend Directive 77/388/EEC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

COMMISSION DECISION of 6 February 1996 concerning the placing on the market of a product consisting of a genetically modified organism, hybrid herbicide-tolerant swede-rape seeds (Brassica napus L. oleifera Metzq. MS1Bn × RF1Bn), pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) (96/158/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 94/15/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 10 to 18 of Directive 90/220/EEC, there is a Community procedure enabling the competent authority of a Member State to give consent to the placing on the market of live products consisting of genetically modified organisms;
Whereas, a notification concerning the placing on the market of such a product (a hybrid herbicide-tolerant swede-rape marketed as seed) has been submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom for the purpose of growing for obtaining seed but not for marketing for human food or animal feed;
Whereas, the competent authorities of the United Kingdom has subsequently forwarded the dossier thereon to the Commission with a favourable opinion;
Whereas the Commission has forwarded the dossier to the competent authorities of all Member States; whereas the competent authorities of other Member States have raised objections to the said dossier;
Whereas the objections raised concern:
- the assessment of the product's effects on the pattern of use of chemical herbicides and the uncertainty concerning any resulting long-term environmental consequences,
- the assessment of the health (toxicological) effects of the product if its is to be used for human food or animal feed, and
- the labelling of the product;
Whereas, therefore, in accordance with Article 13 (3), the Commission is required to take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas the authorization for use in the environment of chemical herbicides is subject to other Community legislation, and in particular Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), as last amended by Directive 94/43/EC (4); whereas, therefore, issues related to the authorization of the herbicide are not within the scope of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas in the notification made under Directive 90/220/EEC the risk to human health and the environment from the survival and spread of this herbicide-tolerant swede-rape was evaluated, as well as the transfer of the herbicide tolerance gene or the other modified genes to compatible species; whereas it was concluded that the risk of establishment was low and that any spread or transfer of the herbicide tolerance gene could be controlled by using existing management strategies;
Whereas, the Commission, having examined the dossier submitted under Directive 90/220/EEC, and having taken into account all the information submitted by the Member States, has found that the information on the environmental risk contained in the dossier is sufficient to enable the Commission to take a favourable decision on the placing on the market of the said product as seed, provided that the specified conditions of use and labelling are followed;
Whereas, Article 11 (6) and Article 16 (1) of Directive 90/220/EEC provide additional safeguards if new information on risks of the product becomes available;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established under Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
1. Subject to the provisions laid down in Council Directive 69/208/EEC (5) and to the conditions outlined in paragraph 2, the authorities of the United Kingdom shall consent to the placing on the market of the following product, notified by Plant Genetic Systems (Reference C/UK/94/M1/1), under Article 13 of Directive 90/220/EEC.
The product comprises of living seeds of a hybrid swede-rape (Brassica napus L. oleifera Metzq.) derived using:
(a) the progeny of the male sterile swede-rape line MS1Bn (B91-4) cultivar Drakkar containing the barnase gene from bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease, the bar gene from streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from nicotiana tabacum; and
(b) the progeny of the fertility restoration swede-rape line RF1BN (B93-101) cultivar drakkar containing the barstar gene from bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease inhibitor, the bar gene from streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from nicotiana tabacum.
2. The conditions of the consent are as follows:
(a) The consent covers the seeds of all hybrids between non-genetically modified swede-rape and the genetically modified swede-rape described in paragraph 1 but does not cover the seeds of any hybrids resulting from a combination of any genetically modified plants other than those described in paragraph 1.
(b) The consent only covers the notified use of the product for growing for obtaining seed, but does not extend to the use for human food or animal feed, without prejudice to any future assessment of the product for such use.
(c) In addition to any other labelling, it will be indicated on the label of each package of seeds that the product is tolerant to the herbicide glufosinateammonium; and that the product is to be used only for obtaining seed and not for human food or animal feed.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 8 (1) (a) of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and the Principality of Andorra (1), signed in Luxembourg on 28 June 1990, stipulates that over a period of five years and beyond that period if no agreement can be reached in accordance with 1 (b), the Principality of Andorra authorizes the Community, acting on behalf of and for the Principality of Andorra, to enter goods sent from third countries to the Principality of Andorra for free circulation;

JOINT ACTION of 4 March 1996 adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on airport transit arrangements (96/197/JHA)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article K.3 (2) (b) thereof,

(2) Whereas all Member States are Contracting Parties to the Convention concerning international carriage by rail (COTIF), which, in Appendix B thereto, defines uniform rules concerning the contract for international carriage of goods by rail (CIM), Annex 1 to which constitutes the regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID); whereas the geographical scope of the Convention extends beyond the Community;
(3) Whereas the Convention does not cover the national carriage of dangerous goods by rail; whereas it is therefore important to ensure the uniform application of harmonized safety rules throughout the Community; whereas the most appropriate way of achieving this is to align the laws applied by the Member States on the RID;
(4) Whereas, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, these laws must be approximated in order to ensure a high level of safety for national and international transport operations, to guarantee the elimination of distortions of competition by facilitating the free movement of goods and services throughout the Community and to ensure consistency with the other Community provisions;
(5) Whereas the provisions of this Directive are without prejudice to the commitment entered into by the Community and its Member States, in accordance with the goals set under Agenda 21, Chapter 19, at the UNCED Conference in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, to strive for the future harmonization of systems for the classification of dangerous substances;
(6) Whereas no specific Community legislation yet governs the safety conditions under which biological agents and genetically modified micro-organisms, regulated under Directives 90/219/EEC (4), 90/220/EEC (5) and 90/676/EEDC (6) should be transported;
(7) Whereas the provisions of this Directive are without prejudice to the application of other Community provisions in the field of worker safety and environmental protection;
(8) Whereas the Member States must be able to apply specific traffic regulations to the transport on their territory of dangerous goods by rail;
(9) Whereas, the Member States should retain the right, with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail, provisionally to implement rules in conformity with the United Nations recommendations on the multimodal transport of dangerous goods, in so far as the RID is not yet harmonized with those regulations, which should facilitate the inter-modal transport of dangerous goods;
(10) Whereas each Member State must retain the right to regulate or prohibit, strictly for reasons other than safety, the internal transport of certain dangerous goods by rail;
(11) Whereas account should be taken of the more stringent safety measures applied in the Channel Tunnel because of its specific characteristics, in particular its route and length; whereas provision should also be made for Member States to be able to introduce the same kind of measures where similar situations arise; whereas it must be possible for some Member States to apply more stringent standards for material intended for transport because of the ambient temperature in their countries;
(12) Whereas, in view of the volume of investment required in this sector, a transitional period should be laid down to enable Member States to retain temporarily certain specific national provisions concerning construction requirements or the use of tanks, receptacles, packaging or an emergency action code;
(13) Whereas the introduction of new developments in technology and industry must not be hindered; whereas temporary derogations should be provided for that purpose;
(14) Whereas the provisions of the RID authorize the conclusion of agreements derogating therefrom; whereas the large number of agreements concluded bilaterally between Member States impedes the free provision of dangerous-goods transport services; whereas including the necessary provisions in the Annex to this Directive should overcome the need for such derogations; whereas provision should be made for a transitional period during which the Member States may continue to apply existing agreements amongst themselves;
(15) Whereas the transport of dangerous goods by rail to or from a third country is authorized, provided it is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the RID; whereas, however, in the case of transport operations from and to the Republics of the former Soviet Union which are not contracting parties to the COTIF, the Member States are entitled to adopt appropriate measures with regard to such operations; whereas they guarantee a level of safety equivalent to that provided for in the RID;
(16) Whereas it must be possible to adapt this Directive rapidly to technical progress, notably by adoption of the new provisions laid down within the framework of the RID; whereas, for that purpose, a Committee should be set up and a procedure established for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within that Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER II Derogations, restrictions and exemptions
Article 4
Each Member State may, for the purposes of national rail transport operations within its territory, retain provisions of its national law on the transport of dangerous goods by rail which are consistent with the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, until such time as the Annex to this Directive is revised to reflect those recommendations. In such cases, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission thereof.

4. A Member State may retain national provisions in force on 31 December 1996 relating to the construction, use and conditions of carriage of new tanks, and new receptacles as defined in Class 2 of the Annex, which differ from the provisions of that Annex, until references to standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles are added to the Annex, with the same binding force as the provisions therein, but in any event no later than 31 December 1998.

12. Provided that there is no loss of safety, a Member State may grant temporary derogations from the Annex for the purpose of carrying out within its territory the trials necessary before the amendment of that Annex in order to adapt them to technological and industrial developments. The Commission shall be informed accordingly and shall in turn inform the other Member States.
Those temporary derogations, agreed among the Member States' competent authorities on the basis of the Annex, shall take the form of a multilateral agreement proposed to all the Member States' competent authorities by the authority that takes the initiative on any agreement. The Commission shall be informed.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1503/96 of 29 July 1996 on the detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with regard to import duties on rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice (1), and in particular Article 11 (2) and (4) thereof,
Whereas the third subparagraph of Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 lays down the method for calculating the percentage by which the intervention price valid on the day of import is to be increased in order to calculate the import duties on milled rice; whereas that method takes account of the conversion rate, processing costs and the value of by-products and an amount for the protection of industry; whereas the day of importation should be fixed as the date of acceptance of the declaration by the customs authorities as laid down in Article 67 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden;
Whereas Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff shall be levied on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation when they are imported; whereas, however, in the case of products referred to in Article 11 (2) the import duty will be equal to the intervention price valid for those products on importation, increased by a certain percentage according to whether it is husked or milled rice, indica rice or japonica rice, and minus the import price, provided that duty does not exceed the rate of the Common Customs Tariff duties;
Whereas there are particular difficulties in the rice sector concerning the verification of the value of imported products; whereas a system of flat-rate values is therefore most suitable for the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of negotiations; whereas, however, technical discussions between the partners concerned are still in progress; whereas, pending the outcome of those discussions, the system applied in 1995/96 should be maintained as a precaution;
Whereas in order to classify the consignments imported, the products referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 must be subdivided into a number of qualities; whereas the combined nomenclature codes to which these qualities correspond must therefore be specified;
Whereas, for the purposes of calculating the import duty using the flat-rate import value, the representative cif import prices should be calculated for each of the qualities defined; whereas, for the purposes of establishing those prices, price quotations for the different qualities of rice must be specified; whereas these quotations should therefore be defined;
Whereas, in the interests of clarity and transparency, the quotations for the different types of rice in publications by the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America constitute an objective basis for establishing representative cif import prices for rice in bulk; whereas representative prices on the United States market, the Thai market or of other origins may be converted into representative cif import prices by adding the maritime freight costs on the charter market between the ports of origin and the Community port; whereas, taking account of the volume of freight and of trade in the ports of northern Europe, those ports constitute the Community destination for which the quotations of maritime freight prices are best known publicly, are most transparent and most easily available; whereas, therefore, the ports of northern Europe (Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Gent) should be adopted as the Community destination ports;
Whereas, in order to monitor the trends in representative cif import prices thus established, it is appropriate to provide for weekly monitoring of the elements contributing to their calculation;
Whereas, for the purposes of fixing import duties for the rice referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, a period of two weeks for determining representative cif import prices for rice in bulk takes account of market trends without introducing elements of uncertainty; whereas, on this basis, import duties for that product should be established taking account of the average of representative cif import prices noted over the abovementioned period, every two weeks on a Wednesday, and on the last working day of each month;
Whereas the import duty thus calculated can be applied over a two-week period without substantially affecting import prices, duties paid; whereas, however, where no quotation is available for a given product over the period of calculation of representative cif import prices or where, following sudden changes in the elements making up the calculation, those representative cif import prices undergo major fluctuations during the period in question, measures must be taken in order to maintain the representative nature of the cif import prices of the product concerned;
Whereas the price of basmati rice originating in India and Pakistan is normally higher on the market than the established representative price; whereas in 1993/94 the difference was of the order of ECU 250 per tonne in the case of basmati rice originating in India and ECU 50 per tonne in the case of basmati rice originating in Pakistan; whereas, as a result, the import duty on those rice varieties should be reduced by the aforementioned amounts in order to comply with the principle laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and the Community's international commitments;
Whereas, where there is no quotation, it is appropriate to continue to apply the amount of duty fixed for the preceding period and, in the case of major fluctuations in the quotation, the cost of maritime freight or the exchange rate used for the calculation of the representative cif import price of the product concerned, the representative nature of that price must be restored, taking account of those changes, by adjusting the duty fixed in line with the difference noted; whereas, even where such adjustments are made, the regular dates for fixing duties will not be affected;
Whereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The import duties referred to in Article 11 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 shall be those applicable at the time laid down in Article 67 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.
Article 2
The import duty for milled rice falling within CN code 1006 30 shall be equal to the intervention price valid at the moment of import increased by:
- 163 % in the case of indica rice,
- 167 % in the case of japonica rice,
minus the import price.
However, that duty must not exceed the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.
Article 3
1. For the purposes of this Regulation indica rice shall be deemed to be rice falling within CN codes 1006 20 17, 1006 20 98, 1006 30 27, 1006 30 48, 1006 30 67 and 1006 30 98.
2. Any other products falling within CN codes 1006 20 and 1006 30 shall be deemed to be japonica rice.
Article 4
1. The import duties for the products referred to in Article 3 shall be calculated every week but shall be fixed by the Commission every two weeks on a Wednesday and on the last working day of each month, and for the period up to the first Thursday of July 1995 from 1 July of that year, in accordance with the method provided for in Article 5 and shall apply from the first working day following their fixing and the first day of the following month, respectively.
However, if the calculation of the week following this fixing shows that the import duty is higher or lower by ECU 10 per tonne than the duty in force, a corresponding adjustment shall be made by the Commission.
The fixing made on the last working day of each month shall be based on the intervention price for the following month.
Where the Wednesday on which import duties would be fixed is not a working day for the Commission, the duties shall be fixed on the first working day following that Wednesday.
2. The price valid on the world market to be used for the calculation of the import duty shall be the average of the weekly representative cif import prices for rice in bulk determined using the method provided for in Article 5 and established over the period of the two preceding weeks.
3. The import duties fixed in accordance with this Regulation shall apply until new duties are fixed and enter into force.
However, where no quotation is available for a given product from the reference source provided for in Article 5 over the two weeks preceding the next periodic fixing, the import duty previously fixed shall remain in force.
Every time the duty is fixed or adjusted, the Commission shall publish the import duties and the factors used for their calculation in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
4. Basmati rice falling within CN codes ex 1006 20 17 and ex 1006 20 98 may benefit from a reduction in the import duty by an amount of ECU 250 for rice originating in India and ECU 50 for rice originating in Pakistan.
This reduction shall be made if, when a product is released for free circulation, an import licence whose issue is conditional on provision of a security, and a certificate of product authenticity are presented.
By way of derogation from Article 10 (a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (3), the security to be provided shall be ECU 275 per tonne for basmati rice originating in India and ECU 75 per tonne for basmati rice originating in Pakistan.
The certificate of authenticity shall be drawn up on the form a specimen of which is shown in Annex II to this Regulation. It shall be issued pursuant to the relevant provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 81/92 (4).
The amounts provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph may be revised in response to market trends.
Article 5
1. To determine the import prices of the rice referred to in Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, the following factors shall be used for the different types of rice in bulk referred to in Article 3:
(a) the cif price at Rotterdam;
(b) the representative price on the Thai market;
(c) the representative price on the United States market;
(d) the representative price on other markets;
(e) the average cost of sea freight between the port of origin and one of the ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Gent.
The import price shall normally be the price indicated under (a), but, in the absence of such a price, shall be determined on the basis of the factors listed under (b), (c) and (e); the prices referred to in (d) shall only be used in the absence of the prices referred to under (a), (b) and (c).
In the absence of quotations for the cost of sea transport of rice, those for cereals shall be used.
2. The factors used for the calculation shall be established and checked each week on the basis of the sources and the reference qualities listed in Annex I to this Regulation. The cost of sea freight shall be established on the basis of information publicly available.
If the price established is expressed as C%amp% F, it shall be increased by 0,75 %.
Article 6
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
It shall apply from 1 September 1996.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, swine, ovine, and caprine animals, fresh meat or meat products from third countries (1), as last amended by Directive 96/91/EC (2), and in particular Articles 21 (a) and 22 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992, laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC (3) as last amended by Directive 96/90/EC (4) and in particular Article 10 (2) (c),
Whereas Council Decision 79/542/EEC (5), as last amended by Commission Decision 97/160/EC (6) draws up a list of third countries from which Member States authorize, amongst others, imports of meat products derived from meat originating from bovine animals, swine, solipeds, sheep and goats;

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1139/98 of 26 May 1998 concerning the compulsory indication of the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
(1) Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Part C of Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (2), consents have been given for the placing on the market of certain genetically modified products by Commission Decision 96/281/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) with increased tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (3), and by Commission Decision 97/98/EC of 23 January 1997 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) with the combined modification for insecticidal properties conferred by the Bt-endotoxin gene and increased tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (4);
(2) Whereas in accordance with Directive 90/220/EEC there were no safety grounds for mentioning on the label of genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) or of genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) that they were obtained by genetic modification techniques;
(3) Whereas Directive 90/220/EEC does not cover non-viable products derived from genetically modified organisms (hereinafter referred to as 'GMOs`);
(4) Whereas certain Member States have taken measures in respect of the labelling of foods and food ingredients produced from the products concerned; whereas differences between those measures are liable to impede the free movement of those foods and food ingredients and thereby adversely affect the functioning of the internal market; whereas it is therefore necessary to adopt uniform Community labelling rules for the products concerned;
(5) Whereas Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (5), lays down, in Article 8, additional specific labelling requirements in order to ensure proper information for the final consumer; whereas those additional specific labelling requirements do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the Community before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) 258/97 and are for that reason considered not to be novel;
(6) Whereas, in order to prevent distortions of competition, labelling rules for the information of the final consumer based on the same principles should apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of or derived from GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 pursuant to a consent given under Directive 90/220/EEC, and to foods and food ingredients which are placed on the market thereafter;
(7) Whereas, therefore, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1813/97 of 19 September 1997 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC (6) laid down general labelling rules for the abovementioned products;
(8) Whereas it is now urgent to lay down detailed uniform Community rules for the labelling of the foodstuffs covered by Regulation (EC) No 1813/97;
(9) Whereas, in particular, drawing on the approach taken in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, it is necessary to ensure that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient; whereas, for that purpose, foods and food ingredients produced from genetically modified soya beans or from genetically modified maize which are not equivalent to conventional counterparts should be subject to labelling requirements;
(10) Whereas, drawing on the approach taken in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, it is necessary that labelling requirements are based on scientific evaluation;
(11) Whereas it is necessary to establish clear labelling rules for the abovementioned products, allowing official control on a reliable, readily repeatable and practicable basis; whereas common scientifically validated testing methods should be developed;
(12) Whereas it is also necessary to ensure that the labelling requirements are no more burdensome than necessary but sufficiently detailed to supply consumers with the information they require;
(13) Whereas at this stage the presence in foods and food ingredients of protein or DNA resulting from genetic modification constitutes the criterion best complying with the abovementioned requirements; whereas such an approach could be reconsidered in the light of future developments in scientific knowledge;
(14) Whereas adventitious contamination of foodstuffs with DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification cannot be excluded; whereas labelling as a result of such contamination could be avoided by setting a threshold for the detection of DNA and protein;
(15) Whereas urgent consideration must be given, in the light of any relevant scientific advice, to the question of whether a de minimis threshold for the presence of DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification can be set and, if so, at what level;
(16) Whereas foods and food ingredients produced from genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) or from genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.), in which DNA resulting from genetic modification is present, are not equivalent and should therefore be subject to labelling requirements;
(17) Whereas it is possible that protein or DNA resulting from genetic modification has been destroyed by successive stages of processing; whereas, in that case, foods and food ingredients should be considered equivalent for labelling purposes; whereas they should therefore not be subject to labelling requirements; whereas a list of such products should be drawn up;
(18) Whereas, nevertheless, some processing methods may eliminate DNA but not proteins; whereas the possibility cannot be excluded that such methods may be capable of being applied to food uses; whereas foods and food ingredients in which DNA resulting from genetic modification is not present but in which proteins resulting from genetic modification are present, cannot be considered to be equivalent; whereas therefore, they should be subject to labelling requirements;
(19) Whereas the necessary information should be provided in the list of ingredients except in the case of products for which no such list exists, in which case it should appear clearly on the labelling of the product;
(20) Whereas this Regulation is without prejudice to the operators' right to include voluntary claims in the labels of their products as to particulars other than those laid down in this Regulation (such as the absence of foods and food ingredients produced from genetically modified soya beans and maize, or the presence of such foods and food ingredients in cases where it is not scientifically verifiable but evidence of it is available through other means), provided that such claims are made in compliance with the provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC;
(21) Whereas, having regard to their scope and effects, the Community measures introduced by this Regulation are not only necessary but essential if the objectives set are to be attained; whereas those objectives cannot be attained by the Member States acting individually;
(22) Whereas this Regulation replaces Commission Regulation (EC) No 1813/97, which should therefore be repealed;
(23) Whereas in pursuance of the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Directive 79/112/EEC, a draft of this text was submitted to the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, which was unable to deliver an opinion, and whereas in accordance with the same procedure the Commission addressed a proposal to the Council, concerning the measures to be adopted,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. This Regulation shall apply to foods and food ingredients which are to be delivered as such to the final consumer (hereinafter referred to as 'the specified foodstuffs`) produced, in whole or in part, from:
- genetically modified soya beans covered by Decision 96/281/EC,
- genetically modified maize covered by Decision 97/98/EC.
2. This Regulation shall not apply to food additives, flavourings for use in foodstuffs or extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.
Article 2
1. The specified foodstuffs shall be subject to the additional specific labelling requirements laid down in paragraph 3.
2. However, the specified foodstuffs in which neither protein nor DNA resulting from genetic modification is present shall not be subject to the said additional specific labelling requirements.
A list of products not subject to the additional specific labelling requirements shall be drawn up under the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Directive 79/112/EEC, taking account of technical developments, the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food and any other relevant scientific advice.

(a) where the food consists of more than one ingredient, the words 'produced from genetically modified soya` or 'produced from genetically modified maize`, as appropriate, shall appear in the list of ingredients provided for by Article 6 of Directive 79/112/EEC in parentheses immediately after the name of the ingredient concerned. Alternatively, these words may appear in a prominently displayed footnote to the list of ingredients, related by means of an asterisk (*) to the ingredient concerned. Where an ingredient is already listed as being produced from soya or maize the words 'produced from genetically modified` may be abbreviated to 'genetically modified`; if the abbreviated form of words is used as a footnote, the asterisk shall be directly attached to the word 'soya` or 'maize`. Where either form of words is used as a footnote, it shall have a typeface of at least the same size as the list of ingredients itself;
(b) in the case of products for which no list of ingredients exists, the words 'produced from genetically modified soya` or 'produced from genetically modified maize`, as appropriate, shall appear clearly on the labelling of the food;
(c) where in accordance with the provisions of the first indent of Article 6(5)(b) of Directive 79/112/EEC an ingredient is designated by the name of a category, that designation shall be completed by the words 'contains . . . (*) produced from genetically modified soya/genetically modified maize
(*) Ingredient(s) to be specified.`, as appropriate;
(d) where an ingredient of a compound ingredient is derived from the specified foodstuffs, it shall be mentioned on the labelling of the final product, with the addition of the wording set out in point (b).
4. This Article shall be without prejudice to the other requirements of Community law concerning the labelling of foodstuffs.
Article 3
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1813/97 is hereby repealed.
Article 4
1. The labelling requirements of this Regulation shall not apply to products which have been lawfully manufactured and labelled in the Community, or which have been lawfully imported into the Community and put into free circulation, before the entry into force of this Regulation.
2. The application of Article 2 to products placed on the market with labelling complying with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1813/97 so as to indicate the presence of genetically modified material may be postponed until six months after the entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 5
This Regulation shall enter into force 90 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2166/1999
of 8 October 1999
laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for the treatment of products in the health, education and social protection sectors in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(1), and in particular Articles 4 and 5(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
After consulting the European Central Bank(2),
Whereas:
(1) by virtue of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each Member State is required to produce a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) starting with the index for January 1997;
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96(3) defines the coverage of the HICP as those goods and services which are included in household final monetary consumption expenditure; goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors are part of the coverage of the HICP; household final monetary consumption covers the expenditure incurred by individuals living in institutional households and should be grouped in accordance with the COICOP/HICP categories as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96(4);
(3) by virtue of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96, in particular Article 3 and Annex Ia thereof, extended coverage in the health, education and social protection sectors should be implemented in December 1999 and take effect with the index for January 2000, whereby the methodological details of inclusion should be specified in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the framework Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, the timetable of inclusion for hospital services and social protection services provided within the home, retirement homes and residences for the disabled should be specified in accordance with the same procedure;
(4) there is considerable scope for procedural differences in the treatment of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors in the HICP; a harmonised methodology for such goods and services is necessary to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability requirements as laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95;
(5) the treatment of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors is consistent with the definitions laid down in the European System of Accounts (ESA) 1995 set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96(5);
(6) the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman; in this case, following the procedure laid down in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, the Commission has to, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Aim
The aim of this Regulation is to set minimum standards for the treatment of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors in the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices, hereafter referred to as HICPs, in order to ensure that they are reliable and relevant and meet the comparability requirements as laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.
Article 2
Definition
1. Reimbursements refer to payments to households by government units, social security administrations or non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), that are made as direct consequences of purchases of individually specified goods and services, initially paid for by households.
2. Payments of claims to households by insurance companies do not constitute reimbursements.
3. Other payments or rebates to households by government units, social security administrations or NPISHs in the form of assistance to reduce household expenditure, such as housing allowances to tenants or payments due to sickness, disability, the care of elderly relatives or scholarships to students, are considered as social benefits in cash. They are treated as income transfers to households and do not constitute reimbursements.
Article 3
Coverage
1. Goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors on which household final monetary consumption expenditure is incurred shall be covered in the HICP and grouped in accordance with the COICOP/HICP categories as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96.
2. All providers of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors, such as government and private institutions, NPISHs or private self-employed persons, shall be covered in the HICP independently of their status. This excludes individuals or groups of individuals as producers of goods and non-financial services exclusively for own final use.
3. In accordance with COICOP/HICP, Education (Division 10) includes education services only. If an all-inclusive price is charged for education services in combination with educational materials or education support services, its components shall be separated and allocated to the COICOP/HICP classes concerned. Where such an all-inclusive price cannot be separated into the prices of the components concerned, the all-inclusive price shall be allocated to COICOP/HICP Division 10.
4. Borderline cases between education services at the pre-primary level and child-minding social protection facilities, such as wet-nurses, crèches and play-schools, shall be allocated to COICOP/HICP Division 10 if the child's age of entry is not less than three years and the activities consist of organised instruction in a school-type environment designed to bridge the gap between the home and school atmosphere. If, on the other hand, the main objective is not a pedagogical one, but to provide child-minding assistance and support, the service concerned should be allocated to COICOP/HICP class 12.4.0.
5. Where hospitals, in addition to basic services as defined in COICOP/HICP 06.3, make other goods or services available to in-patients on a separate charge basis, the latter shall not be allocated to class 06.3.0, but to the COICOP/HICP classes concerned.
Article 4
Prices
1. The HICP sub-indices concerned shall be calculated using a formula which is consistent with the Laspeyres-type formula used for other sub-indices. They should reflect the price change on the basis of the changed expenditure of maintaining the consumption pattern of households and the composition of the consumer population in the base or reference period.
2. (a) The purchaser prices of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors to be used in the HICP shall be the amounts to be paid by consumers net of reimbursements.
(b) Changes in purchaser prices which reflect changes in the rules determining them shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.
(c) Where purchaser prices are index-linked, changes resulting from changes in the index shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.
(d) Changes in the purchaser prices resulting from changes in purchasers' incomes shall be shown as price changes in the HICP.
3. Where quality changes, prices should be treated according to the rules applied in the context of specification changes, and in particular those regarding quality adjustment pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96.
4. Where goods or services, in the health, education and social protection sectors, have been made available to consumers free of charge and subsequently an actual price is charged, the change from zero to an actual price, and vice versa, shall be reflected in the HICP.
5. Where goods or services in the health, education and social protection sectors, jointly provided with other goods and services, have been made available to consumers free of charge and subsequently are charged for on a separate basis, the change shall be reflected in the HICP.
6. Where relevant, the procedure provided for in Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2646/98(6) concerning tariffs shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Article 5
Basic information
The basic information shall be all purchaser prices of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors and their components, together with weightings which reflect the level, the timing and the structure of the consumption of such goods or services, according to the price-determining socioeconomic characteristics.
Article 6
Data sources
1. The HICP sub-indices concerned shall be computed by the Member States from basic information as defined in Article 5.
2. The statistical units, such as government agencies, social security administrations or NPISHs, called upon by the Member States to cooperate in the collection or provision of basic information are obliged to give honest and complete information at the time it is requested and allow the organisations and institutions responsible for compiling official statistics, on request, to obtain information at the level of detail necessary to evaluate compliance with the comparability requirements and the quality of the HICP sub-indices.
Article 7
Comparability
HICPs constructed following the procedures described in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation or following other procedures which do not result in an index which differs systematically by more than one tenth of one percentage point on average over one year against the previous year from an index compiled following those procedures, shall be deemed comparable.
Article 8
Quality control
1. Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat) with information on the procedures developed for the treatment of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors where these procedures differ from those specified in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation, before such procedures are used.
2. Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat), on request, with sufficient information to assess the operation of the procedures laid down in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation. The result of this assessment shall be included in the reports to be submitted by the Commission to the Council as provided for in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1687/98 and in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1688/98.
Article 9
Implementation
The provisions of this Regulation shall be implemented by the Member States in December 1999 and shall take effect with the index for January 2000, apart from the following, which shall be implemented in December 2000 and shall take effect with the index for January 2001:
(a) hospital services (COICOP/HICP 06.3);
(b) social protection services provided within the home, such as home cleaning, meals, transport for the disabled (part of COICOP/HICP 12.4.0);

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2791/1999
of 16 December 1999
laying down certain control measures applicable in the area covered by the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the north-east Atlantic fisheries
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(1),
Whereas:
(1) The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the north-east Atlantic fisheries, hereinafter called %quot%the NEAFC Convention%quot%, was approved by Decision 81/608/EEC(2) and entered into force on 17 March 1982;
(2) The NEAFC Convention provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation on the rational conservation and management of fishery resources in the area defined by the Convention;
(3) The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, at its 17th annual meeting on 17, 18, 19 and 20 November 1998, adopted two recommendations establishing a scheme of control and enforcement applicable to fishing vessels operating in areas beyond the limits of the national jurisdiction of the Contracting Parties in the Convention area (hereinafter called %quot%the Scheme%quot%), and a programme to promote compliance by non-Contracting Party vessels with its recommendations in order to ensure full respect for conservation and management measures adopted by the NEAFC (hereinafter called %quot%the Programme%quot%);
(4) The Scheme provides for control measures applicable to vessels flying the flag of the Contracting Parties and operating in the NEAFC area, and arrangements for inspections at sea which include inspection and surveillance procedures and infringement procedures which must be implemented by the Contracting Parties;
(5) The Programme provides for the mandatory inspection of non-Contracting Party vessels where they enter the ports of the Contracting Parties voluntarily and a prohibition on the landing and transhipment of catches if, during such inspection, it is established that they have been taken in breach of the conservation measures adopted by the NEAFC;
(6) Under Articles 12 and 15 of the NEAFC Convention, these recommendations enter into force on 1 July 1999 and become binding on the Contracting Parties; the Community should apply these recommendations;
(7) In order to make it possible for Community fishing activities in the NEAFC Regulatory Area to be monitored and to supplement the control measures provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(3), certain specific control measures should be laid down, in particular as regards participation in fishing activities, the marking of vessels and fishing gear and their documents, the recording and reporting of catches and the transhipment of fish;
(8) Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 provides that each Member State must ensure that the activities of its vessels outside the Community fishery zone are subject to proper monitoring and, where such Community obligations exist, to inspections and surveillance, in order to ensure compliance with Community rules applicable in those waters; provision should therefore be made that Member States whose vessels are authorised to fish in the NEAFC Regulatory Area assign inspectors to the Scheme to undertake monitoring and surveillance, together with adequate resources for inspection;
(9) In order to ensure the monitoring of fishing activities in the NEAFC area, it is necessary that Member States cooperate with one another and with the Commission in applying the Scheme;
(10) It is the responsibility of Member States to ensure that their inspectors comply with the inspection procedures laid down by the NEAFC;
(11) The masters of Community vessels should cooperate in the inspection of their vessels as provided for in the procedures laid down in this Regulation;
(12) The procedures to be applied in situations where it is suspected that an infringement and in particular a serious infringement has been committed should be laid down; to that end a list of the types of action considered to constitute serious infringements should be drawn up;
(13) Detailed rules for the implementation of the Programme in the Community should be laid down;
(14) Under the Treaty, authority over national waters and ports is exercised by the Member States; however, in the case of access to Community port facilities by non-Contracting Party vessels which have been sighted operating in the NEAFC Regulatory Area, additional uniform measures need to be adopted at Community level so that the activities of those vessels in the Community ports can be regulated, in order to ensure the effectiveness of measures laid down by the NEAFC;
(15) A procedure should be laid down for adopting detailed rules for the implementation of the Scheme;
(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4);
(17) In order to gain experience for the definitive division of tasks to be undertaken, it is appropriate that certain provisions on inspection and control, to be carried out in cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, be applied for a limited period pending a decision on the definitive regime,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

of 24 March 2000
amending Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Articles 10 and 15 thereof,

Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000
of 27 July 2000
on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36 and 37 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4),
Whereas:
(1) The operation and development of the common market for agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy. Such a policy must include, in particular, a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms, depending on the product.
(2) The aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in the Treaty. In the case of flax and hemp grown for fibre, in addition to the provisions on area payments in Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(5), measures are needed to govern the internal market, including aid to primary processors of flax and hemp straw or to farmers who have the straw processed at their own expense.
(3) In order to ensure that flax and hemp straw is actually processed, grant of the aid should be subject to certain conditions, in particular the authorisation of primary processors and the requirement that such processors purchase the straw under contract. Likewise, in order to counter any possible abuse, aid for processing will be granted only on the basis of the processing of the straw, or on the basis of the use of the fibres on the market if the farmer has the straw processed on his behalf.
(4) In order to prevent improper use of Community funds, no aid should be granted to primary processors or farmers who are found to have artificially created the conditions for receiving the aid, thereby enjoying an advantage that does not conform to the objectives of the support scheme for straw processing.
(5) In view of the differences between the market for long flax fibre and the market for short flax fibre and hemp fibre, the aid should be differentiated according to which of the two types of fibre is obtained. In order to ensure that overall support is sufficient to maintain traditional production of long flax fibre in conditions similar to those provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 of 4 July 1970 on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp(6), the aid should be gradually increased to offset the gradual reduction in the aid per hectare paid to growers under Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 and, ultimately, the abolition of the aid for short flax fibre. The aid for short flax fibre and hemp fibre should be fixed at a level that will give new products and their potential outlets the time to reach equilibrium. In order to promote only the production of high quality short flax fibre and hemp fibre, provision should be made for a maximum percentage of impurities and shives, together with transitional provisions to enable the processing industry to adapt to this requirement.
(6) In order to take account of the special status of traditional flax in certain areas of the Netherlands, Belgium and France, additional transitional aid must be granted to the primary processors of straw in respect of the areas concerned.
(7) In order to prevent any fraudulent increases in the quantities eligible for aid, the Member States should fix maximum quantities on the basis of the areas whose straw is the subject of processing contracts or commitments.
(8) In order to keep down the expenditure incurred in applying this Regulation, a stabiliser mechanism should be introduced for both types of fibre obtained, i.e. long flax fibre and short flax fibre and hemp fibre. In order to ensure reasonable production levels in each Member State, a maximum guaranteed quantity should be set for both types of fibre, to be distributed among the Member States as national guaranteed quantities. However, national guaranteed quantities will be fixed for short flax fibre and hemp fibre only for the time needed to allow the new products to adjust to the market. The national guaranteed quantities will apply to processing aid and will not affect the system introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999. The national guaranteed quantities should be fixed taking account in particular of the most recent average areas under fibre flax and hemp, adjusted where necessary to reflect the areas actually in production, multiplied by average fibre yields. With regard to Member States whose current production is low, provision should be made for a common quantity to be apportioned each marketing year in order to enable them to adapt and develop their production.
(9) To enable the Member States to make adjustments between the quantities thus obtained, conditions should be laid down governing transfers between the national guaranteed quantities allocated to each. Any such transfers should be carried out on the basis of a coefficient to ensure budgetary equivalence.
(10) The producer Member States must take the steps needed to ensure that the arrangements for granting the aid operate smoothly. Furthermore, because of the time needed to process all the straw harvested in one marketing year, provision should be made for advance payments as a verification measure.
(11) Taken as a whole, the regime governing trade with third countries should make it possible to dispense with all quantitative restrictions and taxes levied at the Community's external borders. However, this mechanism may in exceptional circumstances prove defective. In such cases, so as not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances which may ensue, the Community should be able to take all necessary measures without delay. All such measures must comply with the obligations arising from the World Trade Organisation agreements on agriculture(7).
(12) In order to prevent illicit crops from disturbing the common organisation of the market in hemp for fibre, provision should be made for checks on imports of hemp and hemp seed to ensure that such products offer certain guarantees with regard to the tetrahydrocannabinol content. In addition, imports of hemp seeds intended for uses other than sowing must be subjected to a control system which makes provision for a system for authorising the importers concerned.
(13) As the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre develops over time, Member States and the Commission must exchange all the information needed for this Regulation to be applied.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).
(15) Expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation should be financed by the Community in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(9).
(16) Although the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 has been amended a number of times, it nevertheless no longer reflects the deep changes that the sector has undergone. This being so, Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 619/71 of 22 March 1971 laying down general rules for granting aid for flax and hemp(10) should be repealed. Council Regulation (EEC) No 620/71 of 22 March 1971 laying down outline provisions for contracts for the sale of flax and hemp straw(11), Council Regulation (EEC) No 1172/71 of 3 June 1971 laying down general rules on private storage aid for flax and hemp fibre(12), Council Regulation (EEC) No 1430/82 of 18 May 1982 providing for restrictions on the importation of hemp and hemp seed and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 in respect of hemp(13) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2059/84 of 16 July 1984 laying down general rules relating to the import restrictions on hemp and hemp seed and amending Regulation (EEC) No 619/71 in respect of hemp(14), which are based on Regulations (EEC) No 1308/70 and (EEC) No 619/71, should be repealed and replaced by the new provisions in this Regulation.
(17) The change from the arrangements in Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 to those in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. In order to deal with that eventuality, provision should be made for the Commission to adopt the necessary transitional measures. The Commission should also be authorised to solve specific practical problems.
(18) Having regard to the date on which this Regulation enters into force, provision needs to be made for special measures for the 2000/2001 marketing year. To that end, the system in force during the 1999/2000 marketing year should remain applicable until 30 June 2001. However, the amounts of aid should be fixed by the Commission on the basis of the budget balances as soon as the areas concerned have been reliably assessed, and the amount withheld for the financing of measures promoting the use of flax fibre should be set at zero.
(19) In order to evaluate the effects of the new measures, the Commission will submit to the European Parliament and the Council reports concerning, on the one hand, in 2003 the national guaranteed quantities and the maximum level of impurities and skives in short flax fibre and hemp fibre, and, on the other hand, in 2005 the impact of processing aid and supplementary aid on producers and markets,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

TITLE I
Internal market
Article 2
1. Aid for processing the straw of flax and hemp grown for fibre shall be introduced.
The aid shall be granted to authorised primary processors on the basis of the quantity of fibre actually obtained from straw for which a sale/purchase contract has been concluded with a farmer.
However:
(a) in cases where the authorised primary processor and the farmer are one and the same person, the sale/purchase contract shall be replaced by a commitment by the party concerned to carry out the processing himself;
(b) in cases where the farmer retains ownership of the straw which he is having processed under contract by an authorised primary processor and proves that he has placed the fibres obtained on the market, the aid shall be granted to the farmer.
2. No aid shall be paid to authorised primary processors or farmers who are found to have artificially created the conditions for receiving the aid, thereby enjoying an advantage that does not conform to the objectives of this scheme.
3. The amount of processing aid per tonne of fibre shall be fixed as follows:
(a) for long flax fibre:
- EUR 100 for the 2001/2002 marketing year,
- EUR 160 for the 2002/2003, 2003/2004, 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 marketing years,
- EUR 200 from the 2006/2007 marketing year onwards.
(b) for short flax fibre and hemp fibre containing not more than 7,5 % impurities and skives: EUR 90 for the 2001/2002 to 2005/2006 marketing years.
However, for the 2001/2002 to 2003/2004 marketing years, the Member State may, with reference to traditional outlets, also decide to grant aid:
- for short flax fibre containing a percentage of impurities and skives of between 7,5 % and 15 %,
- for hemp fibre containing a percentage of impurities and skives of between 7,5 % and 25 %.
In such cases, the Member State shall grant the aid in respect of a quantity which amounts to not more than the quantity produced, on the basis of 7,5 % of impurities and skives.
4. The quantities of fibre eligible for aid shall be limited on the basis of the areas which were the subject of one of the contracts or commitments referred to in paragraph 1.
The limits referred to in the first subparagraph shall be fixed by the Member States so as to comply with the national guaranteed quantities referred to in Article 3.
5. At the request of authorised primary processors, an advance shall be paid on the aid on the basis of the quantity of fibre obtained.

- 12100 tonnes for the United Kingdom.
(b) 5000 tonnes to be apportioned in national guaranteed quantities for each marketing year among Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg. Such apportionment shall be determined on the basis of the areas which were the subject of one of the contracts or commitments referred to in Article 2(1).
The national guaranteed quantities for short flax fibre and hemp fibre, reduced where applicable in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article, shall cease to apply from the 2006/2007 marketing year.
3. In cases where the fibre obtained in one Member State originates from straw produced in another Member State, the quantities of fibre concerned shall be offset against the national guaranteed quantity of the Member State in which the straw was harvested. The aid shall be paid by the Member State against whose national guaranteed quantity such an offset is made.
4. Member States which wish to do so may transfer between themselves, on a one-off basis and before 30 June 2001, part of their national guaranteed quantities referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2, adjusted if necessary in accordance with paragraph 5. In such cases, they shall inform the Commission, which will notify the other Member States accordingly
5. Each Member State may transfer part of its national guaranteed quantity as referred to in paragraph 1 to its national guaranteed quantity as referred to in paragraph 2 and vice versa.
Transfers as referred to in the first subparagraph shall be carried out on the basis of an equivalence of one tonne of long flax fibre to 2,2 tonnes of short flax fibre and hemp fibre.
Processing aid shall be granted only in respect of the quantities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively, adjusted in accordance with the first two subparagraphs of this paragraph and paragraph 4.
Article 4
Until the 2005/2006 marketing year, additional aid shall be granted to the authorised primary processor in respect of areas under flax in zones I and II as described in the Annex and the straw production of which has been the subject of:
- a sale/purchase contract or a commitment as referred to in Article 2(1) and
- aid for processing into long fibre.
The amount of additional aid shall be EUR 120 per hectare in zone I and EUR 50 per hectare in zone II.

Decision of the European Central Bank
of 6 December 2001
on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member States from the financial year 2002
(ECB/2001/16)
(2001/914/EC)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%Statute%quot%), and in particular to Article 32 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 32.1 of the Statute, monetary income is the income accruing to the national central banks (NCBs) in the performance of the monetary policy function. Under the provisions of Article 32.2 of the Statute, the amount of each NCB's monetary income shall be equal to its annual income derived from its assets held against notes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions. These assets are to be earmarked by NCBs in accordance with the guidelines of the Governing Council. As from the financial year 2003, NCBs should earmark the assets ensuing from the performance of the monetary policy function as assets held against the notes in circulation and deposit liabilities to credit institutions. According to Article 32.4 of the Statute, the amount of each NCB's monetary income shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to any interest paid by that NCB on its deposit liabilities to credit institutions in accordance with Article 19 of the Statute.
(2) Pursuant to Article 32.5 of the Statute, the sum of the monetary income of the NCBs shall be allocated to them in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB).
(3) According to Article 32.6 and Article 32.7 of the Statute, the Governing Council of the ECB is empowered to establish guidelines for the clearing and settlement by the ECB of the balances arising from the allocation of monetary income and to take all other measures necessary for the application of Article 32 of the Statute.
(4) Pursuant to Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro(1), from 1 January 2002, the ECB and the NCBs (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%Eurosystem%quot%) shall put into circulation banknotes denominated in euro. Article 15 of this Regulation provides for the continuation of the legal tender status of banknotes denominated in national currency units during a maximum period of six months after the end of the transitional period. The year 2002 should thus be regarded as a special year, since banknotes in circulation denominated in national currency units may still account for a considerable proportion of the total value of Eurosystem banknotes in circulation and with different patterns in Member States. This situation is comparable to the situation from 1999 to 2001 and, therefore, for the financial year 2002 monetary income should be calculated by a method analogous to that provided for in Decision ECB/2000/19 of 3 November 1998 as amended by Decision of 14 December 2000 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member States and losses of the ECB for the financial years 1999 to 2001(2) in order to ensure that changes in the patterns of banknotes circulation do not significantly affect the relative income positions of NCBs. For 2002, Article 32.3 of the Statute allows the Governing Council to decide, by way of derogation from Article 32.2, that monetary income be measured according to an alternative method.
(5) Article 9(1) of Guideline ECB/2001/1 of 10 January 2001 adopting certain provisions on the 2002 cash changeover(3) provides that euro banknotes frontloaded to credit institutions or to their appointed agents shall be debited in their respective accounts with the NCBs, as the case may be, for their face value, according to the following %quot%linear debiting model%quot%: one third of the frontloaded sum on 2 January 2002, one third on 23 January 2002, and the last third on 30 January 2002. The calculation of monetary income for the year 2002 needs to take account of this %quot%linear debiting model%quot%.
(6) This Decision is related to Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro banknotes(4) that provides that the ECB and the NCBs shall issue euro banknotes. Decision ECB/2001/15 establishes the allocation of euro banknotes in circulation to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB. The same Decision allocates to the ECB 8 % of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation. The allocation of euro banknotes among Eurosystem members gives rise to intra-Eurosystem balances. The remuneration of these intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation has a direct effect on the income of each Eurosystem member, and therefore it should be regulated under this Decision. The income accruing to the ECB on the remuneration of its intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs related to its share of euro banknotes in circulation should in principle be distributed to the NCBs in accordance with the decisions of the Governing Council, in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key in the same financial year it accrues.
(7) The net balance of the intra-Eurosystem claims and liabilities on euro banknotes in circulation should be remunerated by applying an objective criterion defining the cost of money. In this context, the main refinancing operations rate used by the Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations is regarded as appropriate.
(8) The net intra-Eurosystem liabilities on euro banknotes in circulation should be included in the liability base for the purposes of the calculation of the NCBs monetary income under Article 32.2 of the Statute as they are equivalent to banknotes in circulation. The settlement of interest on intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation will therefore result in the distribution of a substantial amount of the Eurosystem's monetary income among NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB. These intra-Eurosystem balances should be adjusted to allow for a gradual adaptation of the NCBs' balance sheets and profit and loss accounts. The adjustments should be based on the value of banknotes in circulation of each NCB during a period prior to the introduction of euro banknotes. These adjustments should take account of the special circumstances of the year 2002, during which Member States have different changeover scenarios, and during which credit institutions will increase to different levels their normal cash holdings, and should apply on a yearly basis in accordance with a fixed formula for no more than five years thereafter.
(9) The adjustments to the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation have been calculated in order to compensate for any significant changes in the NCBs' income positions as a consequence of the introduction of the euro banknotes and the subsequent allocation of monetary income. The Governing Council has therefore decided not to have recourse to the derogation from Article 32 of the Statute, allowed by Article 51 of the Statute.
(10) The adjustments to the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation need to take account of the special situation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg arising from its recent monetary history.
(11) The Governing Council of the ECB has adopted this Decision with the expectation that its economic results and the financial equilibrium that such economic results entail remain unchanged during the period of application of Article 4 of this Decision and, therefore, it is the firm commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to ensure the maintenance of the regime provided for by this Decision until 31 December 2007,

Where more than one main refinancing operation is conducted for settlement on the same day, a simple average of the marginal rates of the operations conducted in parallel is used.
Article 2
Intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation
1. The intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation shall be calculated on a monthly basis and shall be recorded in the books of the ECB and the NCBs on the first business day of the month with a value date of the last business day of the preceding month.
The first calculation of the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation under the previous paragraph shall be made for frontloaded euro banknotes on 2 January 2002 with a value date of 1 January 2002.

MI is the amount of each NCB's monetary income to be pooled,
LB is the liability base of each NCB,
RR is the reference rate.
2. From 2003 the amount of each NCB's monetary income shall be determined by measuring the actual income that derives from the earmarkable assets recorded in its books. As an exception thereof, gold shall be considered to generate no income.
3. Where the value of a NCB's earmarkable assets exceeds or falls short of the value of its liability base, the difference shall be offset by applying to the value of the difference the average rate of return on the earmarkable assets of all NCBs taken together.
This average rate of return shall be calculated in the following manner. The total income accrued by all NCBs on their earmarkable assets, excluding all income arising from net intra-Eurosystem claims resulting from TARGET transactions (Annex II, A.3) and net intra-Eurosystem claims on euro banknotes in circulation including those resulting from the application of Article 4 (Annex II, A.4), shall be divided by the average amount of the total earmarkable assets of the Eurosystem. The average rate of return shall be applied on a 360 days basis.
Article 4
Adjustments to intra-Eurosystem balances
1. For the purposes of monetary income calculation, each NCB's intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation shall be adjusted by a compensatory amount determined in accordance with the following formula:
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt%,whereby:
CA is the compensatory amount,
K is the amount for each NCB that results from the application of the subscribed capital key to the average value of banknotes in circulation during the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001,
A is the average value for each NCB of banknotes in circulation during the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001,
C is the following coefficient for each financial year:
%gt%TABLE%gt%
2. The sum of the compensatory amounts of the NCBs shall be 0.
3. The compensatory amounts and the accounting entries to balance those compensatory amounts shall be recorded on separate intra-Eurosystem accounts in the books of each NCB with a value date of 1 January on the first business day of each year. The accounting entries to balance the compensatory amounts shall not be remunerated.
4. In the event that the value of euro banknotes that the Banque centrale du Luxembourg puts into circulation in 2002 exceeds the average value of its banknotes in circulation during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 by 25 % or more, letter %quot%A%quot% in the formula of paragraph 1 shall be for the Banque centrale du Luxembourg the value of banknotes put into circulation by the Banque centrale du Luxembourg in 2002 up to a maximum limit of EUR 2,2 billion. Upon application of this derogation, all compensatory amounts calculated on the basis of Article 4(1) shall be subject to retroactive adjustments at the end of 2002, in order to ensure compliance with paragraph 2. Such retroactive adjustments shall be in proportion to the subscribed capital key.
5.

Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001
of 28 June 2001
introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments, amending Directive 72/462/EEC and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 525/77 and (EEC) No 3763/91 (Poseidom)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36, 37 and Article 299(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(1),
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 89/687/EEC(2), the Council adopted a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the French overseas departments (Poseidom) in accordance with the Community's policy of assistance for the outermost regions. The purpose of the programme is to facilitate the economic and social development of those regions and enable them to benefit from the advantages of the single market of which they are an integral part despite the objective factors leaving them geographically and economically isolated. The programme calls for the CAP to be applied in those regions and provides for special measures to be adopted. In particular, it provides for measures to improve the conditions in which agricultural products are produced and marketed in those departments and to mitigate the effects of their exceptional geographical situation and constraints as since recognised in Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
(2) The particular geographical situation of the French overseas departments (FOD) imposes additional transport costs in supplying essential products, for processing and as agricultural inputs. In addition, objective factors arising as a result of insularity and extreme remoteness impose further constraints on operators and producers in the FOD that severely handicap their activities. This is true particularly in the case of the supply of cereals, which are by and large not produced and cannot be produced on a large scale in the FOD, rendering them dependent on external sources of supply. These handicaps can be alleviated by lowering the price of these essential products. It is therefore appropriate to introduce specific supply arrangements with a view to ensuring supply to the FOD from local production and to mitigating the additional costs of the remoteness, insularity and outermost location of the FOD.
(3) To that end, notwithstanding Article 23 of the Treaty, imports of the products concerned from third countries should be exempt from the applicable import duties.
(4) In order to achieve the goal of lowering prices in the FOD and mitigating the additional costs of their remoteness, insularity and outermost location while maintaining the competitiveness of Community products, aid should be granted for the supply of products of Community origin to the FOD. Such aid should take account of the additional cost of transport to the FOD and the prices applied to exports to third countries and, in the case of agricultural inputs and products intended for processing, the additional costs of insularity and outermost location.
(5) Since the quantities covered by the specific supply arrangements are limited to the supply requirements of the FOD, those arrangements do not impair the proper functioning of the internal market. In addition, the economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements should not provoke deflections of trade in the products concerned. Re-dispatching or re-exportation of those products from the FOD should therefore be prohibited. However, trade flows between the FOD are not covered by this prohibition. Nor does it apply, where processing is concerned, subject to certain conditions, to exports to third countries to promote regional trade or to traditional consignments to the rest of the Community.
(6) The economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements should reduce production costs and be passed on to the end user. They should therefore be granted only on condition that they are actually passed on, and monitoring must be carried out to that end.
(7) In the light of recent agricultural developments in French Guiana, Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91(3) introduced a measure to develop rice cultivation. That measure expired at the end of the 1996 marketing year, and since the Member State concerned has not asked for it to be extended, that measure should be abolished. A measure has been introduced to dispose of and market part of the local production of rice in Guadeloupe, Martinique and the rest of the Community. Since not all of the local production can be consumed in the region, and since lack of facilities and local conditions make storage in the region scarcely feasible, this measure, which is vital to maintain balance in the local production sector, should continue on the terms laid down in the current rules.
(8) Traditional livestock farming activities should be supported in order to meet local consumption needs of the FOD. To that end, derogations are needed from some of the provisions of the common market organisations which restrict production, to take account of the development and particular conditions of local production, which are quite different from those in the rest of the Community. This objective may also be pursued indirectly by financing genetic improvement programmes involving the purchase of pure-bred breeding animals, by purchasing commercial breeds more suited to local conditions, by supplementing the suckler cow premium and the slaughter premium and, where appropriate, by making it possible to import from third countries male bovine animals intended for fattening under certain conditions, as well as by derogating from the import conditions for animals and foodstuffs of animal origin.
(9) Improvements need to be made to the poor conditions for supplying fresh milk products to local markets in the FOD, which at present come mainly from imports; this aim can be achieved on the one hand by continuing aid to develop cow's milk production within the limits of local consumption requirements as periodically evaluated under a supply balance, and on the other hand by ceasing to apply the arrangements for an additional levy on cow's milk producers laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92(4); the poor supply conditions typical of the outermost regions, which are completely different from those prevailing in the rest of the Community, and the need for a local production development incentive justify this derogation.
(10) The Community is contributing funds to regional programmes to support the production and marketing of local products in the livestock and milk products sectors in Martinique and Réunion as a temporary measure from 1996-2000. The level of local self-sufficiency in those sectors is still low. Community support can be mobilised effectively only if the local production structures are able to implement strategies tailored to the local context for economic development, spatial organisation of production and increasing the professionalism of producers. This assistance should be continued as a temporary measure to help the production of a modern, high quality sector to pick up speed. The principle of extending this support to French Guiana and Guadeloupe has been accepted, on condition that local inter-branch organisations are set up.
(11) In the fruit, vegetables, plants and floricultural sector, measures have been introduced to improve farm productivity and product quality, structure the production and distribution chains, develop local processed products and maintain certain traditional production (vanilla, essential oils, etc.), with a view to supporting the local marketing, processing and export sales of those products. These measures have helped to start improving the ability of local products to compete with products from elsewhere on high-growth markets, to satisfy the requirements of consumers and new distribution channels and to establish these upgraded products on the Community market, and should therefore be continued.
(12) Regulation (EEC) No 525/77(5) established a system of production aid for tinned pineapple which has been applied only in Martinique. Given the specific features of the scheme and the production region, in the interests of legislative and administrative harmonisation, the scheme should be included in this Regulation and Regulation (EEC) No 525/77 should be repealed. If pineapple production is to have a future, all those engaged in the sector must be mobilised. Pineapple production is particularly important in Martinique, for both economic and social reasons. Pineapples are expensive to produce and products processed from them face competition from third countries. Support should continue to be granted for processing and to ensure the survival of small farms, ensure a regular supply to the processing industry and reinforce the role of producer organisations while opening the way in the medium term to improved profitability and, if appropriate, the marketing of fresh produce.
(13) The sugar-cane sector is vital to the economy of the FOD. The FOD continue to face serious handicaps (remoteness, insularity, outermost location, difficult mountainous terrain, small and widely dispersed farms, few factories, high local transport costs, difficult access because of poor roads) which push up costs. Sugar-cane production also faces specific handicaps in comparison with the production of sugarbeet in mainland Europe, particularly regarding the harvesting of cane. To ensure that the sector develops properly and to alleviate these difficulties, measures are needed to offset partially the additional costs of transporting cane from fields to reception centres.
(14) Rum is a product of great economic importance for the FOD, and market outlets are vital. The gradual abolition of certain benefits currently accorded to rum production would have a serious impact on the earnings of the producers. The measures to support the cultivation of sugar cane and its direct processing into agricultural rum and sugar syrup should be continued because these measures are helping to ensure continued deliveries of cane to distilleries, which can thus plan and rationalise investments in their production facilities, and because they help improve the incomes of cane growers and encourage them to improve their production methods to ensure higher yields and deliver better quality cane.
(15) Agricultural producers in the FOD should be encouraged to supply quality products and the marketing of these should be assisted, in this respect, using the Community's graphic symbol might help achieve this purpose.
(16) The plant health of agricultural crops in the FOD is subject to particular problems associated with the climate and the inadequacy of the control measures hitherto applied there. Programmes should be implemented to combat harmful organisms, including by organic methods. The Community's financial contribution towards such programmes should be specified.
(17) Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(6) lays down rural development measures that may be granted Community support and sets out the conditions for obtaining such support.
(18) This Regulation seeks to remedy the handicaps due to the remote and insular nature of the FOD and to improve the conditions under which their agricultural products are produced and marketed.
(19) The structures of certain agricultural holdings or processing and marketing enterprises located in the FOD show serious shortcomings and are beset with specific difficulties. Provision should accordingly be made for derogations for certain types of investments from the provisions limiting or preventing the grant of some structural aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(20) Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 restricts the grant of forestry support to forests and wooded areas belonging to private owners and municipalities and associations thereof. The great majority of forests and wooded areas located in the FOD belong to public authorities other than municipalities. Under these circumstances, the conditions laid down in the said Article should be made more flexible.
(21) The Community financial contribution for three of the accompanying measures referred to in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 may amount in the outermost regions to up to 85 % of the total eligible cost. On the other hand, in accordance with the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the Community financial contribution for agri-environmental measures, which constitutes the fourth accompanying measure, is to be limited to 75 % for all areas covered by Objective 1. In view of the importance attributed to agri-environment within the context of rural development, the rate of the Community financial contribution should be harmonised for all accompanying measures in the outermost regions.
(22) Pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(7), each plan, Community support framework, operational programme and single programming document is to cover a period of seven years, and the programming period is to begin on 1 January 2000. In the interests of cohesiveness and to avoid discrimination between beneficiaries of the same programme, the derogations provided for in this Regulation should, exceptionally, be applicable to the whole programming period.
(23) A derogation may be granted from the Commission's consistent policy of not authorising State operating aid for the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty in order to mitigate the specific constraints on farming in the FOD as a result of their remoteness, insularity and outermost location, small area, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on a small number of products.
(24) Provision should be made for the possibility of adopting transitional rules in order to facilitate the move from the system laid down in amended Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91, and from the system laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 525/77, to the new system laid down in this Regulation and, in the event of extensions to the existing measures, to ensure the necessary continuity.
(25) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regualtion should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8),

Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001
of 8 October 2001
on the Statute for a European company (SE)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Whereas:
(1) The completion of the internal market and the improvement it brings about in the economic and social situation throughout the Community mean not only that barriers to trade must be removed, but also that the structures of production must be adapted to the Community dimension. For that purpose it is essential that companies the business of which is not limited to satisfying purely local needs should be able to plan and carry out the reorganisation of their business on a Community scale.
(2) Such reorganisation presupposes that existing companies from different Member States are given the option of combining their potential by means of mergers. Such operations can be carried out only with due regard to the rules of competition laid down in the Treaty.
(3) Restructuring and cooperation operations involving companies from different Member States give rise to legal and psychological difficulties and tax problems. The approximation of Member States' company law by means of Directives based on Article 44 of the Treaty can overcome some of those difficulties. Such approximation does not, however, release companies governed by different legal systems from the obligation to choose a form of company governed by a particular national law.
(4) The legal framework within which business must be carried on in the Community is still based largely on national laws and therefore no longer corresponds to the economic framework within which it must develop if the objectives set out in Article 18 of the Treaty are to be achieved. That situation forms a considerable obstacle to the creation of groups of companies from different Member States.
(5) Member States are obliged to ensure that the provisions applicable to European companies under this Regulation do not result either in discrimination arising out of unjustified different treatment of European companies compared with public limited-liability companies or in disproportionate restrictions on the formation of a European company or on the transfer of its registered office.
(6) It is essential to ensure as far as possible that the economic unit and the legal unit of business in the Community coincide. For that purpose, provision should be made for the creation, side by side with companies governed by a particular national law, of companies formed and carrying on business under the law created by a Community Regulation directly applicable in all Member States.
(7) The provisions of such a Regulation will permit the creation and management of companies with a European dimension, free from the obstacles arising from the disparity and the limited territorial application of national company law.
(8) The Statute for a European public limited-liability company (hereafter referred to as %quot%SE%quot%) is among the measures to be adopted by the Council before 1992 listed in the Commission's White Paper on completing the internal market, approved by the European Council that met in Milan in June 1985. The European Council that met in Brussels in 1987 expressed the wish to see such a Statute created swiftly.
(9) Since the Commission's submission in 1970 of a proposal for a Regulation on the Statute for a European public limited-liability company, amended in 1975, work on the approximation of national company law has made substantial progress, so that on those points where the functioning of an SE does not need uniform Community rules reference may be made to the law governing public limited-liability companies in the Member State where it has its registered office.
(10) Without prejudice to any economic needs that may arise in the future, if the essential objective of legal rules governing SEs is to be attained, it must be possible at least to create such a company as a means both of enabling companies from different Member States to merge or to create a holding company and of enabling companies and other legal persons carrying on economic activities and governed by the laws of different Member States to form joint subsidiaries.
(11) In the same context it should be possible for a public limited-liability company with a registered office and head office within the Community to transform itself into an SE without going into liquidation, provided it has a subsidiary in a Member State other than that of its registered office.
(12) National provisions applying to public limited-liability companies that offer their securities to the public and to securities transactions should also apply where an SE is formed by means of an offer of securities to the public and to SEs wishing to utilise such financial instruments.
(13) The SE itself must take the form of a company with share capital, that being the form most suited, in terms of both financing and management, to the needs of a company carrying on business on a European scale. In order to ensure that such companies are of reasonable size, a minimum amount of capital should be set so that they have sufficient assets without making it difficult for small and medium-sized undertakings to form SEs.
(14) An SE must be efficiently managed and properly supervised. It must be borne in mind that there are at present in the Community two different systems for the administration of public limited-liability companies. Although an SE should be allowed to choose between the two systems, the respective responsibilities of those responsible for management and those responsible for supervision should be clearly defined.
(15) Under the rules and general principles of private international law, where one undertaking controls another governed by a different legal system, its ensuing rights and obligations as regards the protection of minority shareholders and third parties are governed by the law governing the controlled undertaking, without prejudice to the obligations imposed on the controlling undertaking by its own law, for example the requirement to prepare consolidated accounts.
(16) Without prejudice to the consequences of any subsequent coordination of the laws of the Member States, specific rules for SEs are not at present required in this field. The rules and general principles of private international law should therefore be applied both where an SE exercises control and where it is the controlled company.
(17) The rule thus applicable where an SE is controlled by another undertaking should be specified, and for this purpose reference should be made to the law governing public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE has its registered office.
(18) Each Member State must be required to apply the sanctions applicable to public limited-liability companies governed by its law in respect of infringements of this Regulation.
(19) The rules on the involvement of employees in the European company are laid down in Directive 2001/86/EC(4), and those provisions thus form an indissociable complement to this Regulation and must be applied concomitantly.
(20) This Regulation does not cover other areas of law such as taxation, competition, intellectual property or insolvency. The provisions of the Member States' law and of Community law are therefore applicable in the above areas and in other areas not covered by this Regulation.
(21) Directive 2001/86/EC is designed to ensure that employees have a right of involvement in issues and decisions affecting the life of their SE. Other social and labour legislation questions, in particular the right of employees to information and consultation as regulated in the Member States, are governed by the national provisions applicable, under the same conditions, to public limited-liability companies.
(22) The entry into force of this Regulation must be deferred so that each Member State may incorporate into its national law the provisions of Directive 2001/86/EC and set up in advance the necessary machinery for the formation and operation of SEs with registered offices within its territory, so that the Regulation and the Directive may be applied concomitantly.
(23) A company the head office of which is not in the Community should be allowed to participate in the formation of an SE provided that company is formed under the law of a Member State, has its registered office in that Member State and has a real and continuous link with a Member State's economy according to the principles established in the 1962 General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment. Such a link exists in particular if a company has an establishment in that Member State and conducts operations therefrom.
(24) The SE should be enabled to transfer its registered office to another Member State. Adequate protection of the interests of minority shareholders who oppose the transfer, of creditors and of holders of other rights should be proportionate. Such transfer should not affect the rights originating before the transfer.
(25) This Regulation is without prejudice to any provision which may be inserted in the 1968 Brussels Convention or in any text adopted by Member States or by the Council to replace such Convention, relating to the rules of jurisdiction applicable in the case of transfer of the registered offices of a public limited-liability company from one Member State to another.
(26) Activities by financial institutions are regulated by specific directives and the national law implementing those directives and additional national rules regulating those activities apply in full to an SE.
(27) In view of the specific Community character of an SE, the %quot%real seat%quot% arrangement adopted by this Regulation in respect of SEs is without prejudice to Member States' laws and does not pre-empt any choices to be made for other Community texts on company law.
(28) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers of action other than those of Article 308 thereof.
(29) Since the objectives of the intended action, as outlined above, cannot be adequately attained by the Member States in as much as a European public limited-liability company is being established at European level and can therefore, because of the scale and impact of such company, be better attained at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in the said Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to attain these objectives,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 7
The registered office of an SE shall be located within the Community, in the same Member State as its head office. A Member State may in addition impose on SEs registered in its territory the obligation of locating their head office and their registered office in the same place.
Article 8
1. The registered office of an SE may be transferred to another Member State in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 13. Such a transfer shall not result in the winding up of the SE or in the creation of a new legal person.
2. The management or administrative organ shall draw up a transfer proposal and publicise it in accordance with Article 13, without prejudice to any additional forms of publication provided for by the Member State of the registered office.

6. No decision to transfer may be taken for two months after publication of the proposal. Such a decision shall be taken as laid down in Article 59.
7. Before the competent authority issues the certificate mentioned in paragraph 8, the SE shall satisfy it that, in respect of any liabilities arising prior to the publication of the transfer proposal, the interests of creditors and holders of other rights in respect of the SE (including those of public bodies) have been adequately protected in accordance with requirements laid down by the Member State where the SE has its registered office prior to the transfer.
A Member State may extend the application of the first subparagraph to liabilities that arise (or may arise) prior to the transfer.
The first and second subparagraphs shall be without prejudice to the application to SEs of the national legislation of Member States concerning the satisfaction or securing of payments to public bodies.
8. In the Member State in which an SE has its registered office the court, notary or other competent authority shall issue a certificate attesting to the completion of the acts and formalities to be accomplished before the transfer.
9. The new registration may not be effected until the certificate referred to in paragraph 8 has been submitted, and evidence produced that the formalities required for registration in the country of the new registered office have been completed.
10. The transfer of an SE's registered office and the consequent amendment of its statutes shall take effect on the date on which the SE is registered, in accordance with Article 12, in the register for its new registered office.

12. The new registration and the deletion of the old registration shall be publicised in the Member States concerned in accordance with Article 13.
13. On publication of an SE's new registration, the new registered office may be relied on as against third parties. However, as long as the deletion of the SE's registration from the register for its previous registered office has not been publicised, third parties may continue to rely on the previous registered office unless the SE proves that such third parties were aware of the new registered office.
14. The laws of a Member State may provide that, as regards SEs registered in that Member State, the transfer of a registered office which would result in a change of the law applicable shall not take effect if any of that Member State's competent authorities opposes it within the two-month period referred to in paragraph 6. Such opposition may be based only on grounds of public interest.
Where an SE is supervised by a national financial supervisory authority according to Community directives the right to oppose the change of registered office applies to this authority as well.
Review by a judicial authority shall be possible.
15. An SE may not transfer its registered office if proceedings for winding up, liquidation, insolvency or suspension of payments or other similar proceedings have been brought against it.
16. An SE which has transferred its registered office to another Member State shall be considered, in respect of any cause of action arising prior to the transfer as determined in paragraph 10, as having its registered office in the Member States where the SE was registered prior to the transfer, even if the SE is sued after the transfer.
Article 9
1. An SE shall be governed:
(a) by this Regulation,
(b) where expressly authorised by this Regulation, by the provisions of its statutes
or
(c) in the case of matters not regulated by this Regulation or, where matters are partly regulated by it, of those aspects not covered by it, by:
(i) the provisions of laws adopted by Member States in implementation of Community measures relating specifically to SEs;
(ii) the provisions of Member States' laws which would apply to a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office;
(iii) the provisions of its statutes, in the same way as for a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office.
2. The provisions of laws adopted by Member States specifically for the SE must be in accordance with Directives applicable to public limited-liability companies referred to in Annex I.
3. If the nature of the business carried out by an SE is regulated by specific provisions of national laws, those laws shall apply in full to the SE.
Article 10
Subject to this Regulation, an SE shall be treated in every Member State as if it were a public limited-liability company formed in accordance with the law of the Member State in which it has its registered office.
Article 11
1. The name of an SE shall be preceded or followed by the abbreviation SE.
2. Only SEs may include the abbreviation SE in their name.
3. Nevertheless, companies, firms and other legal entities registered in a Member State before the date of entry into force of this Regulation in the names of which the abbreviation SE appears shall not be required to alter their names.
Article 12
1. Every SE shall be registered in the Member State in which it has its registered office in a register designated by the law of that Member State in accordance with Article 3 of the first Council Directive (68/151/EEC) of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community(6).
2. An SE may not be registered unless an agreement on arrangements for employee involvement pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2001/86/EC has been concluded, or a decision pursuant to Article 3(6) of the Directive has been taken, or the period for negotiations pursuant to Article 5 of the Directive has expired without an agreement having been concluded.
3. In order for an SE to be registered in a Member State which has made use of the option referred to in Article 7(3) of Directive 2001/86/EC, either an agreement pursuant to Article 4 of the Directive must have been concluded on the arrangements for employee involvement, including participation, or none of the participating companies must have been governed by participation rules prior to the registration of the SE.
4. The statutes of the SE must not conflict at any time with the arrangements for employee involvement which have been so determined. Where new such arrangements determined pursuant to the Directive conflict with the existing statutes, the statutes shall to the extent necessary be amended.
In this case, a Member State may provide that the management organ or the administrative organ of the SE shall be entitled to proceed to amend the statutes without any further decision from the general shareholders meeting.
Article 13
Publication of the documents and particulars concerning an SE which must be publicised under this Regulation shall be effected in the manner laid down in the laws of the Member State in which the SE has its registered office in accordance with Directive 68/151/EEC.
Article 14
1. Notice of an SE's registration and of the deletion of such a registration shall be published for information purposes in the Official Journal of the European Communities after publication in accordance with Article 13. That notice shall state the name, number, date and place of registration of the SE, the date and place of publication and the title of publication, the registered office of the SE and its sector of activity.
2. Where the registered office of an SE is transferred in accordance with Article 8, notice shall be published giving the information provided for in paragraph 1, together with that relating to the new registration.
3. The particulars referred to in paragraph 1 shall be forwarded to the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities within one month of the publication referred to in Article 13.

Article 19
The laws of a Member State may provide that a company governed by the law of that Member State may not take part in the formation of an SE by merger if any of that Member State's competent authorities opposes it before the issue of the certificate referred to in Article 25(2).
Such opposition may be based only on grounds of public interest. Review by a judicial authority shall be possible.

(a) the type, name and registered office of every merging company;

Article 23
1. The general meeting of each of the merging companies shall approve the draft terms of merger.

Article 24
1. The law of the Member State governing each merging company shall apply as in the case of a merger of public limited-liability companies, taking into account the cross-border nature of the merger, with regard to the protection of the interests of:
(a) creditors of the merging companies;
(b) holders of bonds of the merging companies;
(c) holders of securities, other than shares, which carry special rights in the merging companies.
2. A Member State may, in the case of the merging companies governed by its law, adopt provisions designed to ensure appropriate protection for minority shareholders who have opposed the merger.
Article 25
1. The legality of a merger shall be scrutinised, as regards the part of the procedure concerning each merging company, in accordance with the law on mergers of public limited-liability companies of the Member State to which the merging company is subject.
2. In each Member State concerned the court, notary or other competent authority shall issue a certificate conclusively attesting to the completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities.
3. If the law of a Member State to which a merging company is subject provides for a procedure to scrutinise and amend the share-exchange ratio, or a procedure to compensate minority shareholders, without preventing the registration of the merger, such procedures shall only apply if the other merging companies situated in Member States which do not provide for such procedure explicitly accept, when approving the draft terms of the merger in accordance with Article 23(1), the possibility for the shareholders of that merging company to have recourse to such procedure. In such cases, the court, notary or other competent authorities may issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 2 even if such a procedure has been commenced. The certificate must, however, indicate that the procedure is pending. The decision in the procedure shall be binding on the acquiring company and all its shareholders.
Article 26
1. The legality of a merger shall be scrutinised, as regards the part of the procedure concerning the completion of the merger and the formation of the SE, by the court, notary or other authority competent in the Member State of the proposed registered office of the SE to scrutinise that aspect of the legality of mergers of public limited-liability companies.
2. To that end each merging company shall submit to the competent authority the certificate referred to in Article 25(2) within six months of its issue together with a copy of the draft terms of merger approved by that company.
3. The authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular ensure that the merging companies have approved draft terms of merger in the same terms and that arrangements for employee involvement have been determined pursuant to Directive 2001/86/EC.
4. That authority shall also satisfy itself that the SE has been formed in accordance with the requirements of the law of the Member State in which it has its registered office in accordance with Article 15.
Article 27
1. A merger and the simultaneous formation of an SE shall take effect on the date on which the SE is registered in accordance with Article 12.

(c) the company being acquired ceases to exist;
(d) the acquiring company adopts the form of an SE.

4. The rights and obligations of the participating companies on terms and conditions of employment arising from national law, practice and individual employment contracts or employment relationships and existing at the date of the registration shall, by reason of such registration be transferred to the SE upon its registration.
Article 30
A merger as provided for in Article 2(1) may not be declared null and void once the SE has been registered.
The absence of scrutiny of the legality of the merger pursuant to Articles 25 and 26 may be included among the grounds for the winding-up of the SE.
Article 31
1. Where a merger within the meaning of Article 17(2)(a) is carried out by a company which holds all the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of another company, neither Article 20(1)(b), (c) and (d), Article 29(1)(b) nor Article 22 shall apply. National law governing each merging company and mergers of public limited-liability companies in accordance with Article 24 of Directive 78/855/EEC shall nevertheless apply.
2. Where a merger by acquisition is carried out by a company which holds 90 % or more but not all of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of another company, reports by the management or administrative body, reports by an independent expert or experts and the documents necessary for scrutiny shall be required only to the extent that the national law governing either the acquiring company or the company being acquired so requires.

That period shall begin on the date upon which the terms for the formation of the holding SE have been finally determined in accordance with Article 32.
2. The holding SE shall be formed only if, within the period referred to in paragraph 1, the shareholders of the companies promoting the operation have assigned the minimum proportion of shares in each company in accordance with the draft terms of formation and if all the other conditions are fulfilled.
3. If the conditions for the formation of the holding SE are all fulfilled in accordance with paragraph 2, that fact shall, in respect of each of the promoting companies, be publicised in the manner laid down in the national law governing each of those companies adopted in implementation of Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC.
Shareholders of the companies promoting the operation who have not indicated whether they intend to make their shares available to the promoting companies for the purpose of forming the holding SE within the period referred to in paragraph 1 shall have a further month in which to do so.

2. A Member State may determine the categories of transactions which must at least be indicated in the statutes of SEs registered within its territory.
Article 49
The members of an SE's organs shall be under a duty, even after they have ceased to hold office, not to divulge any information which they have concerning the SE the disclosure of which might be prejudicial to the company's interests, except where such disclosure is required or permitted under national law provisions applicable to public limited-liability companies or is in the public interest.

Where employee participation is provided for in accordance with Directive 2001/86/EC, a Member State may provide that the supervisory organ's quorum and decision-making shall, by way of derogation from the provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, be subject to the rules applicable, under the same conditions, to public limited-liability companies governed by the law of the Member State concerned.
Article 51
Members of an SE's management, supervisory and administrative organs shall be liable, in accordance with the provisions applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated, for loss or damage sustained by the SE following any breach on their part of the legal, statutory or other obligations inherent in their duties.

Article 54
1. An SE shall hold a general meeting at least once each calendar year, within six months of the end of its financial year, unless the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated applicable to public limited-liability companies carrying on the same type of activity as the SE provides for more frequent meetings. A Member State may, however, provide that the first general meeting may be held at any time in the 18 months following an SE's incorporation.

1. One or more shareholders who together hold at least 10 % of an SE's subscribed capital may request the SE to convene a general meeting and draw up the agenda therefor; the SE's statutes or national legislation may provide for a smaller proportion under the same conditions as those applicable to public limited-liability companies.
2. The request that a general meeting be convened shall state the items to be put on the agenda.
3. If, following a request made under paragraph 1, a general meeting is not held in due time and, in any event, within two months, the competent judicial or administrative authority within the jurisdiction of which the SE's registered office is situated may order that a general meeting be convened within a given period or authorise either the shareholders who have requested it or their representatives to convene a general meeting. This shall be without prejudice to any national provisions which allow the shareholders themselves to convene general meetings.
Article 56
One or more shareholders who together hold at least 10 % of an SE's subscribed capital may request that one or more additional items be put on the agenda of any general meeting. The procedures and time limits applicable to such requests shall be laid down by the national law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated or, failing that, by the SE's statutes. The above proportion may be reduced by the statutes or by the law of the Member State in which the SE's registered office is situated under the same conditions as are applicable to public limited-liability companies.
Article 57
Save where this Regulation or, failing that, the law applicable to public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which an SE's registered office is situated requires a larger majority, the general meeting's decisions shall be taken by a majority of the votes validly cast.

The votes cast shall not include votes attaching to shares in respect of which the shareholder has not taken part in the vote or has abstained or has returned a blank or spoilt ballot paper.

2. The conversion of an SE into a public limited-liability company shall not result in the winding up of the company or in the creation of a new legal person.
3. The management or administrative organ of the SE shall draw up draft terms of conversion and a report explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the conversion and indicating the implications of the adoption of the public limited-liability company for the shareholders and for the employees.
4. The draft terms of conversion shall be publicised in the manner laid down in each Member State's law in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC at least one month before the general meeting called to decide thereon.
5. Before the general meeting referred to in paragraph 6, one or more independent experts appointed or approved, in accordance with the national provisions adopted in implementation of Article 10 of Directive 78/855/EEC, by a judicial or administrative authority in the Member State to which the SE being converted into a public limited-liability company is subject shall certify that the company has assets at least equivalent to its capital.
6. The general meeting of the SE shall approve the draft terms of conversion together with the statutes of the public limited-liability company. The decision of the general meeting shall be passed as laid down in the provisions of national law adopted in implementation of Article 7 of Directive 78/855/EEC.
TITLE VI
ADDITIONAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
Article 67
1. If and so long as the third phase of economic and monetary union (EMU) does not apply to it each Member State may make SEs with registered offices within its territory subject to the same provisions as apply to public limited-liability companies covered by its legislation as regards the expression of their capital. An SE may, in any case, express its capital in euro as well. In that event the national currency/euro conversion rate shall be that for the last day of the month preceding that of the formation of the SE.
2. If and so long as the third phase of EMU does not apply to the Member State in which an SE has its registered office, the SE may, however, prepare and publish its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts in euro. The Member State may require that the SE's annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts be prepared and published in the national currency under the same conditions as those laid down for public limited-liability companies governed by the law of that Member State. This shall not prejudge the additional possibility for an SE of publishing its annual and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts in euro in accordance with Council Directive 90/604/EEC of 8 November 1990 amending Directive 78/60/EEC on annual accounts and Directive 83/349/EEC on consolidated accounts as concerns the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies and the publication of accounts in ecu(11).

(d) allowing provisions in the statutes of an SE adopted by a Member State in execution of authorisations given to the Member States by this Regulation or laws adopted to ensure the effective application of this Regulation in respect to the SE which deviate from or are complementary to these laws, even when such provisions would not be authorised in the statutes of a public limited-liability company having its registered office in the Member State.
Article 70
This Regulation shall enter into force on 8 October 2004.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

of 18 February 2002
on a common format for the submission of summaries of national fuel quality data
(notified under document number C(2002) 508)
(2002/159/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC(1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) It is necessary for the Member States to monitor the quality of petrol and diesel fuels marketed in their territories in order to ensure compliance with the environmental specifications contained in Directive 98/70/EC and to ensure the effectiveness of measures to reduce atmospheric pollution caused by vehicles.
(2) It is necessary to establish a common reporting format for the submission of fuel quality monitoring information in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 98/70/EC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
This Decision establishes a common format for the submission of national fuel quality data in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/70/EC.

Commission Decision
of 21 February 2002
amending Annex D to Council Directive 90/426/EEC with regard to diagnostic tests for African horse sickness
(notified under document number C(2002) 556)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2002/160/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(1), as last amended by Decision 2001/298/EC(2), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC describes the complement fixation test to be carried out for the diagnosis of African horse sickness.
(2) In November 2000 the Community reference laboratory in Algete, Spain, hosted the annual meeting of the national reference laboratories for African horse sickness of EU Member States. During this meeting scientific evidence was presented that the complement fixation test currently described in Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC has serious limitations in particular because it is only suitable for detecting antibodies after a recent infection or vaccination. Furthermore, the test is in practice replaced by modern ELISA tests in almost all laboratories in the Community and also in major exporting countries.
(3) The internationally accepted laboratory tests for the detection of antibodies against the African horse sickness virus are described in the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines(3) of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE); however, the current edition mentions only one of the ELISA tests available.
(4) Therefore, it appears appropriate to modify Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC so as to take into account technical developments and internationally approved standards.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Commission Decision
of 18 December 2001
laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Decision 2000/596/EC as regards management and control systems and procedures for making financial corrections in the context of actions co-financed by the European Refugee Fund
(notified under document number C(2001) 4372)
(2002/307/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2000/596/EC of 28 September 2000 establishing a European Refugee Fund(1), and in particular Article 24 thereof,
Having consulted the Committee set up under Article 21(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC,
Whereas:
(1) To ensure sound financial management of the assistance granted from the European Refugee Fund (the Fund), the Member States need to establish guidelines for the organisation of the tasks of the authority responsible for implementing co-financed actions.
(2) To ensure that Community funds are utilised in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, the Member States need to introduce management and control systems that provide a sufficient audit trail, and to lend the Commission any assistance it requires to carry out checks, especially sample checks.
(3) To ensure that Community funds are used efficiently and appropriately, uniform criteria should be established for the checks carried out by the Member States under Article 18 of Decision 2000/596/EC.
(4) To ensure uniform treatment of the declarations of expenditure for which assistance is requested from the Fund under Article 17(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC, a model declaration of expenditure should be produced.
(5) To allow recovery, pursuant to Article 18(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC, of amounts unduly paid, Member States need to inform the Commission of cases of irregularities detected and the progress of administrative or legal proceedings.
(6) Article 19(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC lays down that Member States must make the financial corrections required in connection with the individual or systemic irregularity by cancelling all or part of the Community contribution. To ensure that this provision is applied uniformly throughout the Community, it is necessary to lay down rules for determining the corrections to be made and to provide for the Commission to be informed.
(7) If a Member State fails to comply with its obligations under Article 19(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC or under Article 18, the Commission may itself make the financial corrections under Article 18(4) of the same Decision. Whenever this is possible and feasible, the amount of the correction must be assessed on the basis of individual files and must be equal to the amount of expenditure wrongly charged to the Fund in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Where it is not possible or feasible to quantify the financial impact of the irregularity accurately, or where it would be disproportionate to cancel all the expenditure concerned, the Commission should determine its corrections by extrapolation or at a flat rate based on the extent and financial impact of the irregularity that the Member State has failed to prevent, detect or correct.
(8) Certain detailed rules for making the financial corrections laid down in Article 19(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC should be specified, and the same rules should be made applicable in cases that fall under Article 18(4)(b) of the same Decision.
(9) Interest rates must be set for interest on account of late payment in respect of any sum received unduly and to be recovered that must be repaid to the Commission under Article 19(3) of Decision 2000/596/EC.
(10) This Decision is to be applied without prejudice to the provisions on recovery of State aid under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(2).
(11) This Decision is to be applied without prejudice to the provisions of Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities(3),
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
CHAPTER I

Without prejudice to Article 18(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC, the guidelines shall cover the organisation of the management and control systems necessary to ensure the accuracy, regularity and eligibility of requests for Community funding and shall refer to the generally recognised standards of good administrative practice set out in Annex I.
2. Where all or some of the responsible authority's tasks are delegated to intermediary organisations, the guidelines referred to in paragraph 1 shall lay down detailed rules concerning:
(a) the clear definition and allocation of tasks, especially as regards management, payment, and checks on and verification of compliance with:
(i) the conditions laid down in the Commission decisions approving the requests for co-financing referred to in Article 8 of Decision 2000/596/EC,
(ii) the rules on eligibility of expenditure set out in Annex 1 to Commission Decision 2001/275/EC(4), and

This description shall include the following information about each responsible authority:
(a) the tasks assigned to it;
(b) the distribution of these tasks within the responsible authority or intermediary organisation in such a way as to ensure that management, payment, and control tasks are sufficiently separate as to ensure sound financial management;

(e) the provisions governing internal audits or equivalent.
4. The Commission shall examine the management and control systems in cooperation with the Member States and point out any shortcomings as regards the transparency of checks on the operation of the Fund and the performance of the Commission's duties under Article 274 of the EC Treaty.
Article 4
1. Member States' management and control systems shall provide an adequate audit trail.
2. An audit trail shall be considered sufficient where it permits:
(a) reconciliation of the summary accounts certified to the Commission with the individual expenditure records and supporting documents kept at the various administrative levels and by the final beneficiaries, including the organisations or firms responsible for implementing projects; and
(b) verification of the allocation and transfers of the available Community and national funds.
An indicative description of the information requirements for a sufficient audit trail is given in Annex II.
3. The responsible authority shall introduce procedures to ensure that a record is kept of the location of all documents relating to particular payments made under the national implementation programme in question and that the documents can be produced for inspection if requested by:
(a) the staff of the authority responsible for handling requests for payment,
(b) the national audit authorities who will carry out the checks required under Article 5(1) of this Decision,

(d) the officials and authorised representatives of the Commission and the European Court of Auditors.
The officials and agents responsible for controls or those empowered for that purpose may request copies of documents referred to in this paragraph.
4. For a period of five years following the payment by the Commission of the final balance in respect of any project, the responsible authorities shall keep available for the Commission all the supporting documents, i.e. the originals or versions certified to be in conformity with the originals on commonly accepted data carriers, regarding expenditure and checks on the project concerned. This period shall be interrupted in the case of legal proceedings or at the duly motivated request of the Commission.
Article 5
1. Member States shall organise checks on projects on an appropriate sampling basis, designed in particular to:
(a) verify the proper operation of the management and control systems in place;
(b) verify selectively, on the basis of risk analysis, expenditure declarations made at the various levels concerned.
2. The checks shall cover at least 20 % of the total eligible expenditure for each national implementation programme and a representative sample of the projects approved, taking account of the requirements of paragraph 3. Member States shall ensure an appropriate separation between checks and implementation or payment procedures concerning projects.
3. The projects selected shall be identified, the sampling method described and a report produced of the results of all inspections and the action taken with regard to the anomalies or irregularities discovered.
4. The sample of projects to be checked shall:
(a) include an appropriate mix of types and sizes of projects;
(b) take account of any risk factors which have been identified by national or Community controls;
(c) reflect the concentration of projects under certain recipients of grants, so that the main recipients are subject to at least one check before the closure of each form of national implementation programme.
Article 6
When carrying out checks, the Member States shall verify the following:
(a) the effective application of the management and control systems;
(b) for an adequate number of accounting records, the correspondence of those records with the supporting documents kept by the intermediary organisations to which the responsible authority has delegated certain responsibilities for implementation, the recipients of grants and, where appropriate, the other organisations or firms involved in project implementation;
(c) the presence of a sufficient audit trail;
(d) that the nature and date of the expenditure items corresponds to Community requirements, to the requirements specified during the national selection procedure, to the terms of the contract or instrument granting the subsidy and to the works actually executed;
(e) that the use or intended use of the project is consistent with the objectives set out in the national implementation programme referred to in Article 8 of Decision 2000/596/EC;
(f) that the Community financial contributions are within the limits provided for in Article 13 of Decision 2000/596/EC or in any other applicable Community provisions and are paid to recipients without any reductions or delays;

They shall also identify the causes of such situations, any further examination which may be required and the necessary corrective and preventive action.
Article 8
Member States shall inform the Commission each year in the report referred to in Article 20(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC of how they have applied Articles 5, 6 and 7 of this Decision during the preceding year, completing or updating if necessary the description referred to in Article 4(2).

For all expenditure it declares to the Commission, the responsible authority shall provide assurance that the national implementation programmes are managed in accordance with all the applicable Community regulations and that the funds are used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management. This assurance shall certify that the request for co-financing covers only expenditure:
(a) that was actually incurred by the grant recipients, as defined in Article 2(d) of Decision 2001/275/EC, during the period of eligibility of the programme, as defined in the decisions approving the requests for co-financing, and
(b) that relates to projects which were selected for co-financing by the national implementation programme in question according to the established selection criteria and procedures and which complied with Community rules throughout the period in which the expenditure was incurred.
3. At the end of the programme, the final declaration laid down in Annex IV shall be presented by the Member State within six months. Failing this, the Commission shall automatically close the programme and decommit the relevant appropriations.
4. Before submitting a request to the Commission, the responsible authority shall verify the adequacy of the checks carried out. The work performed shall be described in detail in the final report referred to in Article 20(3) of Decision 2000/596/EC. Checks shall cover the physical aspects and effectiveness of projects, as well as their financial and accounting aspects.
CHAPTER IV
FINANCIAL CORRECTIONS BY MEMBER STATES
Article 11
1. In the case of systemic irregularities, investigations under Article 19(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC shall cover all the projects liable to be affected.
2. When cancelling all or part of the Community contribution, Member States shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Fund.
3. Member States shall inform the Commission, in a list annexed to the report referred to in Article 20(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC, of any proceedings to cancel assistance initiated in the course of the preceding year.
Article 12
1. Where amounts need to be recovered following the cancellation of the Community contribution under Article 18(1)(g) of Decision 2000/596/EC, the department or organisation responsible shall initiate the recovery procedure and inform the responsible authority. Information on recovery shall be passed on to the Commission and the accounts shall be kept in accordance with Article 13 of this Decision.
2. Member States shall inform the Commission in the report referred to in Article 20(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC how they have decided or propose to re-use the funds cancelled.
Article 13
The responsible authority shall keep an account of amounts recoverable from payments of Community assistance that have already been made and shall ensure that the amounts are recovered without delay. After recovery, the responsible authority shall reduce its next declaration of expenditure to the Commission by an amount equal to the sums recovered, or, if this amount is insufficient, it shall reimburse the Community. The amounts to be recovered shall accrue interest from their due date at the rate laid down in Article 94 of Commission Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EC) No 3418/93 of 9 December 1993 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Financial Regulation(5) of 21 December 1977, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1687/2001(6), for the first working day of the month in which the debt is due.
When submitting the report referred to in Article 20(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC, Member States shall send the Commission a list of irregularities detected, indicating the amounts recovered or awaiting recovery and, if appropriate, any administrative or judicial proceedings launched with a view to recovering amounts unduly paid.
CHAPTER V
FINANCIAL CORRECTIONS BY THE COMMISSION
Article 14
1. The amount of financial corrections made by the Commission under Article 18(4)(b) of Decision 2000/596/EC for individual or systemic irregularities shall be assessed wherever possible and practicable on the basis of individual files and be equal to the amount of expenditure wrongly charged to the Fund, having regard to the principle of proportionality.
2. Where it is not possible or practicable to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure or where it would be disproportionate to cancel all the expenditure concerned, the Commission shall base its financial corrections on:
(a) extrapolation, using a representative sample of transactions that are homogeneous in nature; or
(b) a flat rate, in which case it shall assess the seriousness of the infringement of the rules and the extent and financial implications of the irregularity established.
3. Where the Commission bases its position on facts established by auditors from outside its own departments, it shall draw its own conclusions on the financial implications after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 18(1) of Decision 2000/596/EC.
4. The period of time within which the Member State concerned may respond to a request under Article 18(3) of Decision 2000/596/EC shall be two months. In duly justified cases, a longer period may be agreed by the Commission.
5. Where the Commission proposes financial corrections determined by extrapolation or at a flat rate, the Member State shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate, on the basis of an examination of the files concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity was less than the Commission's assessment. In agreement with the Commission, the Member State may limit the scope of this examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the files concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for this examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in paragraph 4. The Commission shall take account of any evidence supplied by the Member State within the time limits.
6. Where the Commission suspends payments under Article 19(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC, or where, after expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 4, the reasons for the suspension remain or the Member State concerned has not notified the Commission of the measures taken to correct the irregularities, Article 18(4) of Decision 2000/596/EC shall apply.
7. Guidelines on the principles, criteria and indicative scales to be applied by Commission departments in determining the flat-rate corrections are set out in Annex III to this Decision.
Article 15
1. Any repayment to the Commission under Article 19(3) of Decision 2000/596/EC shall be made by the deadline set in the recovery order drawn up in accordance with Article 28 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977(7). This due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order.
2. Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date referred to in paragraph 1 and ending on the date of actual repayment. The applicable rate of interest shall be that referred to in Article 13 of this Decision.
3. A financial correction under Article 19(2) of Decision 2000/596/EC shall not prejudice the Member State's obligation to pursue recoveries under Article 18(1)(g) of Decision 2000/596/EC and Article 12(1) of this Decision and to recover State aid under Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.

Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 22 July 2002
laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 1 May 2002,
Whereas:
(1) A clean and healthy environment is essential for the well-being and prosperity of society, yet continued growth at a global level will lead to continuing pressures on the environment.
(2) The Community's fifth environmental action programme %quot%Towards Sustainability%quot% ended on 31 December 2000 having delivered a number of important improvements.
(3) Continued effort is required in order to meet the environmental objectives and targets already established by the Community and there is a need for the Sixth Environmental Action Programme (the %quot%Programme%quot%) set out in this Decision.
(4) A number of serious environmental problems persist and new ones are emerging which require further action.
(5) Greater focus on prevention and the implementation of the precautionary principle is required in developing an approach to protect human health and the environment.
(6) A prudent use of natural resources and the protection of the global eco-system together with economic prosperity and a balanced social development are a condition for sustainable development.
(7) The Programme aims at a high level of protection of the environment and human health and at a general improvement in the environment and quality of life, indicates priorities for the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Strategy and should be taken into account when bringing forward actions under the Strategy.
(8) The Programme aims to achieve a decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth whilst being consistent with the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the diversity of conditions across the various regions of the European Union.
(9) The Programme establishes environmental priorities for a Community response focusing in particular on climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health and quality of life, and natural resources and wastes.
(10) For each of these areas key objectives and certain targets are indicated and a number of actions are identified with a view to achieving the said targets. These objectives and targets constitute performance levels or achievements to be aimed at.
(11) The objectives, priorities and actions of the Programme should contribute to sustainable development in the candidate countries and endeavour to ensure the protection of the natural assets of these countries.
(12) Legislation remains central to meeting environmental challenges and full and correct implementation of the existing legislation is a priority. Other options for achieving environmental objectives should also be considered.
(13) The Programme should promote the process of integration of environmental concerns into all Community policies and activities in line with Article 6 of the Treaty in order to reduce the pressures on the environment from various sources.
(14) A strategic integrated approach, incorporating new ways of working with the market, involving citizens, enterprises and other stakeholders is needed in order to induce necessary changes in both production and public and private consumption patterns that influence negatively the state of, and trends in, the environment. This approach should encourage sustainable use and management of land and sea.
(15) Provision for access to environmental information and to justice and for public participation in policy-making will be important to the success of the Programme.
(16) Thematic strategies will consider the range of options and instruments required for dealing with a series of complex issues that require a broad and multi-dimensional approach and will propose the necessary actions, involving where appropriate the European Parliament and the Council.
(17) There is scientific consensus that human activity is causing increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases, leading to higher global temperatures and disruption to the climate.
(18) The implications of climate change for human society and for nature are severe and necessitate mitigation. Measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases can be implemented without a reduction in levels of growth and prosperity.
(19) Regardless of the success of mitigation, society needs to adapt to and prepare for the effects of climate change.
(20) Healthy and balanced natural systems are essential for supporting life on the planet.
(21) There is considerable pressure from human activity on nature and biodiversity. Action is necessary to counteract pressures arising notably from pollution, the introduction of non-native species, potential risks from releasing genetically modified organisms and the way in which the land and sea are exploited.
(22) Soil is a finite resource that is under environmental pressure.
(23) Despite improvements in environmental standards, there is increased likelihood of a link between environmental degradation and certain human illnesses. Therefore the potential risks arising, for example, from emissions and hazardous chemicals, pesticides, and from noise should be addressed.
(24) Greater knowledge is required on the potential negative impacts arising from the use of chemicals and the responsibility for generating knowledge should be placed on producers, importers and downstream users.
(25) Chemicals that are dangerous should be replaced by safer chemicals or safer alternative technologies not entailing the use of chemicals, with the aim of reducing risks to man and the environment.
(26) Pesticides should be used in a sustainable way so as to minimise negative impacts for human health and the environment.
(27) The urban environment is home to some 70 % of the population and concerted efforts are needed to ensure a better environment and quality of life in towns and cities.
(28) There is a limited capacity of the planet to meet the increasing demand for resources and to absorb the emissions and waste resulting from their use and there is evidence that the existing demand exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment in several cases.
(29) Waste volumes in the Community continue to rise, a significant quantity of these being hazardous, leading to loss of resources and to increased pollution risks.
(30) Economic globalisation means that environmental action is increasingly needed at international level, including on transport policies, requiring new responses from the Community linked to policy related to trade, development and external affairs enabling sustainable development to be pursued in other countries. Good governance should make a contribution to this end.
(31) Trade, international investment flows and export credits should make a more positive contribution to the pursuit of environmental protection and sustainable development.
(32) Environmental policy-making, given the complexities of the issues, needs to be based on best available scientific and economic assessment, and on knowledge of the state and trends of the environment, in line with Article 174 of the Treaty.
(33) Information to policy makers, stakeholders and the general public has to be relevant, transparent, up to date and easily understandable.
(34) Progress towards meeting environmental objectives needs to be measured and evaluated.
(35) On the basis of an assessment of the state of the environment, taking account of the regular information provided by the European Environment Agency, a review of progress and an assessment of the need to change orientation should be made at the mid term point of the Programme,
HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
Scope of the Programme
1. This Decision establishes a programme of Community action on the environment (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%Programme%quot%). It addresses the key environmental objectives and priorities based on an assessment of the state of the environment and of prevailing trends including emerging issues that require a lead from the Community. The Programme should promote the integration of environmental concerns in all Community policies and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development throughout the current and future enlarged Community. The Programme furthermore provides for continuous efforts to achieve environmental objectives and targets already established by the Community.
2. The Programme sets out the key environmental objectives to be attained. It establishes, where appropriate, targets and timetables. The objectives and targets should be fulfilled before expiry of the Programme, unless otherwise specified.
3. The Programme shall cover a period of ten years starting from 22 July 2002. Appropriate initiatives in the different policy areas with the aim of meeting the objectives shall consist of a range of measures including legislation and the strategic approaches outlined in Article 3. These initiatives should be presented progressively and at the latest by four years after the adoption of this Decision.
4. The objectives respond to the key environmental priorities to be met by the Community in the following areas:
- climate change,
- nature and biodiversity,
- environment and health and quality of life,
- natural resources and wastes.
Article 2
Principles and overall aims
1. The Programme constitutes a framework for the Community's environmental policy during the period of the Programme with the aim of ensuring a high level of protection, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity and the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Community, and of achieving a decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth. It shall be based particularly on the polluter-pays principle, the precautionary principle and preventive action, and the principle of rectification of pollution at source.
The Programme shall form a basis for the environmental dimension of the European Sustainable Development Strategy and contribute to the integration of environmental concerns into all Community policies, inter alia by setting out environmental priorities for the Strategy.
2. The Programme aims at:
- emphasising climate change as an outstanding challenge of the next 10 years and beyond and contributing to the long term objective of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Thus a long term objective of a maximum global temperature increase of 2 °Celsius over pre-industrial levels and a CO2 concentration below 550 ppm shall guide the Programme. In the longer term this is likely to require a global reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 70 % as compared to 1990 as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC);
- protecting, conserving, restoring and developing the functioning of natural systems, natural habitats, wild flora and fauna with the aim of halting desertification and the loss of biodiversity, including diversity of genetic resources, both in the European Union and on a global scale;
- contributing to a high level of quality of life and social well being for citizens by providing an environment where the level of pollution does not give rise to harmful effects on human health and the environment and by encouraging a sustainable urban development;
- better resource efficiency and resource and waste management to bring about more sustainable production and consumption patterns, thereby decoupling the use of resources and the generation of waste from the rate of economic growth and aiming to ensure that the consumption of renewable and non-renewable resources does not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment.
3. The Programme shall ensure that environmental objectives, which should focus on the environmental outcomes to be achieved, are met by the most effective and appropriate means available, in the light of the principles set out in paragraph 1 and the strategic approaches set out in Article 3. Full consideration shall be given to ensuring that the Community's environmental policy-making is undertaken in an integrated way and to all available options and instruments, taking into account regional and local differences, as well as ecologically sensitive areas, with an emphasis on:
- developing European initiatives to raise the awareness of citizens and local authorities;
- extensive dialogue with stakeholders, raising environmental awareness and public participation;
- analysis of benefits and costs, taking into account the need to internalise environmental costs;
- the best available scientific evidence, and the further improvement of scientific knowledge through research and technological development;
- data and information on the state and trends of the environment.
4. The Programme shall promote the full integration of environmental protection requirements into all Community policies and actions by establishing environmental objectives and, where appropriate, targets and timetables to be taken into account in relevant policy areas.
Furthermore, measures proposed and adopted in favour of the environment should be coherent with the objectives of the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development and vice versa.
5. The Programme shall promote the adoption of policies and approaches that contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the countries which are candidates for accession (%quot%Candidate Countries%quot%) building on the transposition and implementation of the acquis. The enlargement process should sustain and protect the environmental assets of the Candidate Countries such as wealth of biodiversity, and should maintain and strengthen sustainable production and consumption and land use patterns and environmentally sound transport structures through:
- integration of environmental protection requirements into Community Programmes including those related to development of infrastructure;
- promotion of transfer of clean technologies to the Candidate Countries;
- extended dialogue and exchange of experience with the national and local administrations in the Candidate Countries on sustainable development and preservation of their environmental assets;
- cooperation with civil society, environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and business in the Candidate Countries to help raise public awareness and participation;
- encouraging international financing institutions and the private sector to support the implementation of and compliance with the environmental acquis in the Candidate Countries and to pay due attention to integrating environmental concerns into the activities of the economic sector.
6. The Programme shall stimulate:
- the positive and constructive role of the European Union as a leading partner in the protection of the global environment and in the pursuit of a sustainable development;
- the development of a global partnership for environment and sustainable development;
- the integration of environmental concerns and objectives into all aspects of the Community's external relations.
Article 3

- stimulating product innovation with the aim of greening the market including through improved dissemination of results of the LIFE Programme(6);
- encouraging voluntary commitments or agreements to achieve clear environmental objectives, including setting out procedures in the event of non-compliance;
6. To help ensure that individual consumers, enterprises and public bodies in their roles as purchasers, are better informed about the processes and products in terms of their environmental impact with a view to achieving sustainable consumption patterns. This requires:
- encouraging the uptake of eco-labels and other forms of environmental information and labelling that allow consumers to compare environmental performance between products of the same type;
- encouraging the use of reliable self-declared environmental claims and preventing misleading claims;
- promoting a green public procurement policy, allowing environmental characteristics to be taken into account and the possible integration of environmental life cycle, including the production phase, concerns in the procurement procedures while respecting Community competition rules and the internal market, with guidelines on best practice and starting a review of green procurement in Community Institutions;
7. To support environmental integration in the financial sector. This requires:
- considering a voluntary initiative with the financial sector, covering guide-lines for the incorporation of data on environmental cost in company annual financial reports, and the exchange of best policy practices between Member States;
- calling on the European Investment Bank to strengthen the integration of environmental objectives and considerations into its lending activities in particular with a view to supporting a sustainable development of Candidate Countries;
- promoting integration of environmental objectives and considerations into the activities of other financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development;
8. To create a Community liability regime requires inter alia:
- legislation on environmental liability;
9. To improve collaboration and partnership with consumer groups and NGOs and promote better understanding of and participation in environmental issues amongst European citizens requires:
- ensuring access to information, participation and justice through early ratification of the Aarhus Convention(7) by the Community and by Member States;
- supporting the provision of accessible information to citizens on the state and trends of the environment in relation to social, economic and health trends;
- general raising of environmental awareness;
- developing general rules and principles for good environmental governance in dialogue processes;
10. To encourage and promote effective and sustainable use and management of land and sea taking account of environmental concerns. This requires, while fully respecting the subsidiarity principle, the following:
- promoting best practice with respect to sustainable land use planning, which takes account of specific regional circumstances with particular emphasis on the Integrated Coastal Zone Management programme;
- promoting best practices and supporting networks fostering the exchange of experience on sustainable development including urban areas, sea, coastline, mountain areas, wetlands and other areas of a sensitive nature;
- enhancing the use, increasing resources and giving broader scope for agri-environment measures under the Common Agricultural Policy;
- encouraging Member States to consider using regional planning as an instrument for improving environmental protection for the citizen and promoting the exchange of experience on sustainable regional development, particularly in urban and densely populated areas.
Article 4

Article 5
Objectives and priority areas for action on tackling climate change
1. The aims set out in Article 2 should be pursued by the following objectives:
- ratification and entering into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations framework Convention on climate change by 2002 and fulfilment of its commitment of an 8 % reduction in emissions by 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels for the European Community as a whole, in accordance with the commitment of each Member State set out in the Council Conclusions of 16 and 17 June 1998;
- realisation by 2005 of demonstrable progress in achieving the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol;
- placing the Community in a credible position to advocate an international agreement on more stringent reduction targets for the second commitment period provided for by the Kyoto Protocol. This agreement should aim at cutting emissions significantly, taking full account, inter alia, of the findings of the IPCC 3rd Assessment Report, and take into account the necessity to move towards a global equitable distribution of greenhouse gas emissions.
2. These objectives shall be pursued by means, inter alia, of the following priority actions:
(i) Implementing international climate commitments including the Kyoto Protocol by means of:
(a) examining the results of the European Climate Change Programme and adopting effective common and coordinated policies and measures on its basis, as appropriate, for various sectors complementary to domestic actions in the Member States;
(b) working towards the establishment of a Community framework for the development of effective CO2 emissions trading with the possible extension to other greenhouse gases;
(c) improving monitoring of greenhouse gases and of progress towards delivering Member States commitments made under the Internal Burden Sharing Agreement;
(ii) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector:
(a) undertaking as soon as possible an inventory and review of subsidies that counteract an efficient and sustainable use of energy with a view to gradually phasing them out;
(b) encouraging renewable and lower carbon fossil fuels for power generation;
(c) encouraging the use of renewable energy sources, including the use of incentives, including at the local level, with a view to meeting the indicative target of 12 % of total energy use by 2010;
(d) introducing incentives to increase Combined Heat and Power and implement measures aiming at doubling the overall share of Combined Heat and Power in the Community as a whole to 18 % of the total gross electricity generation;
(e) prevent and reduce methane emissions from energy production and distribution;
(f) promoting energy efficiency;
(iii) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector:
(a) identifying and undertaking specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation by 2002;
(b) identifying and undertaking specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping if no such action is agreed within the International Maritime Organisation by 2003;
(c) encouraging a switch to more efficient and cleaner forms of transport including better organisation and logistics;
(d) in the context of the EU target of an 8 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, inviting the Commission to submit by the end of 2002 a Communication on quantified environmental objectives for a sustainable transport system;
(e) identifying and undertaking further specific action, including any appropriate legislation, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles including N2O;
(f) promoting the development and use of alternative fuels and of low-fuel-consuming vehicles with the aim of substantially and continually increasing their share;
(g) promoting measures to reflect the full environmental costs in the price of transport;
(h) decoupling economic growth and the demand for transport with the aim of reducing environmental impacts;
(iv) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in industrial production:
(a) promoting eco-efficiency practices and techniques in industry;
(b) developing means to assist SMEs to adapt, innovate and improve performance;
(c) encouraging the development of more environmentally sound and technically feasible alternatives, including the establishment of Community measures, aiming at reducing emissions, phasing out the production where appropriate and feasible and reducing the use of industrial fluorinated gases HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons), PFCs (Perfluorocarbons) and SF6 (sulphur hexafluoride);
(v) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors:
(a) promoting energy efficiency notably for heating, cooling and hot tap water in the design of buildings;
(b) taking into account the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alongside with other environmental considerations, in the Common agricultural policy and in the Community's waste management strategy;
(vi) Using other appropriate instruments such as:
(a) promoting the use of fiscal measures, including a timely and appropriate Community framework for energy taxation, to encourage a switch to more efficient energy use, cleaner energy and transport and to encourage technological innovation;
(b) encouraging environmental agreements with industry sectors on greenhouse gas emission reductions;
(c) ensuring climate change as a major theme of Community policy for research and technological development and for national research programmes.
3. In addition to the mitigation of climate change, the Community should prepare for measures aimed at adaptation to the consequences of climate change, by:
- reviewing Community policies, in particular those relevant to climate change, so that adaptation is addressed adequately in investment decisions;
- encouraging regional climate modelling and assessments both to prepare regional adaptation measures such as water resources management, conservation of biodiversity, desertification and flooding prevention and to support awareness raising among citizens and business.
4. It must be ensured that the climate challenge is taken into account in the Community's enlargement. This will require, inter alia, the following actions with Candidate Countries:
- supporting capacity building, for the application of domestic measures for the use of the Kyoto mechanisms and improved reporting and emission monitoring;
- supporting a more sustainable transport and energy sector;
- ensuring that cooperation with candidate countries is further strengthened on climate change issues.
5. Combating climate change will form an integral part of the European Union's external relations policies and will constitute one of the priorities in its sustainable development policy. This will require concerted and coordinated efforts on the part of the Community and its Member States with a view to:
- capacity-building to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition for example through encouraging projects in connection with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto Protocol and joint implementation;
- responding to identified technology-transfer needs;
- assisting with the challenge of adapting to climate change in the countries concerned.
Article 6

Article 12
This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Directive 2002/74/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 23 September 2002
amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) The Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers adopted on 9 December 1989 states, in point 7, that the completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in the European Community and that this improvement must cover, where necessary, the development of certain aspects of employment regulations such as procedures for collective redundancies and those regarding bankruptcies.
(2) Directive 80/987/EEC(4) aims to provide a minimum degree of protection for employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. To this end, it obliges the Member States to establish a body which guarantees payment of the outstanding claims of the employees concerned.
(3) Changes in insolvency law in the Member States and the development of the internal market mean that certain provisions of that Directive must be adapted.
(4) Legal certainty and transparency also require clarification with regard to the scope and certain definitions of Directive 80/987/EEC. In particular the possible exclusions granted to the Member States should be indicated in the enacting provisions of the Directive and consequently the Annex thereto should be deleted.
(5) In order to ensure equitable protection for the employees concerned, the definition of the state of insolvency should be adapted to new legislative trends in the Member States and should also include within this concept insolvency proceedings other than liquidation. In this context, Member States should, in order to determine the liability of the guarantee institution, be able to lay down that where an insolvency situation results in several insolvency proceedings, the situation be treated as a single insolvency procedure.
(6) It should be ensured that the employees referred to in Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC(5), Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the ETUC, UNICE and CEEP(6) and Council Directive 91/383/EEC of 25 June 1991 supplementing the measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment relationship(7) are not excluded from the scope of this Directive.
(7) In order to ensure legal certainty for employees in the event of insolvency of undertakings pursuing their activities in a number of Member States, and to strengthen workers' rights in line with the established case law of the Court of Justice, provisions should be introduced which expressly state which institution is responsible for meeting pay claims in these cases and establishes as the aim of cooperation between the competent administrative authorities of the Member States the early settlement of employees' outstanding claims. Furthermore it is necessary to ensure that the relevant arrangements are properly implemented by making provision for collaboration between the competent administrative authorities in the Member States.
(8) Member States may set limitations on the responsibility of the guarantee institutions which should be compatible with the social objective of the Directive and may take into account the different levels of claims.
(9) In order to make it easier to identify insolvency proceedings in particular in situations with a cross-border dimension, provision should be made for the Member States to notify the Commission and the other Member States about the types of insolvency proceedings which give rise to intervention by the guarantee institution.
(10) Directive 80/987/EEC should be amended accordingly.
(11) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the amendment of certain provisions of Directive 80/987/EEC to take account of changes in the activities of undertakings in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(12) The Commission should submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the implementation and application of this Directive in particular as regards the new forms of employment emerging in the Member States,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1889/2002
of 23 October 2002
on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 448/98 completing and amending Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to the allocation of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) within the European System of national and regional Accounts (ESA)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 448/98 of 16 February 1998 completing and amending Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to the allocation of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) within the European System of national and regional Accounts (ESA)(1) and in particular Article 5(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European System of national and regional accounts in the Community(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 359/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), (hereafter %quot%the ESA 95%quot%) contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 448/98, in its Annex I, amended Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 in order to introduce in the ESA 95 methodology the principle for allocating FISIM and set up experimental methods of allocating FISIM which were to be tested by Member States from 1995 to 2001, the trial period being sufficiently long to evaluate whether the allocation yielded more reliable results than the present zero allocation for the correct measurement of the economic activity concerned.
(3) In accordance with Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 448/98, a final report has been presented on 21 June 2002 by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, containing a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the implications of the experimental methods for allocating and calculating FISIM. This final report concluded that the results of the trial period were positive, as it is broadly recognised that the allocation of FISIM would lead to major improvements in the methodology of the ESA 95 and to a more accurate comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) levels within the European Union.
(4) Since the findings of the final evaluation report on the reliability of the results obtained during the trial period have been positive, the method to be used for the allocation of FISIM must be adopted before 31 December 2002 in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 448/98.
(5) In its final report presented to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission considered that two additional years could be useful in order to enable Member States to make further improvements in the sources and methods used for the allocation of FISIM.
(6) The Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB), set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC(4), as amended by Decision 96/174/EC(5), has been consulted.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC),
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Member States shall carry out the following calculations and allocations in accordance with the detailed methodology described in Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 448/98:
(a) the calculation and allocation of FISIM among user sectors, using the reference rate defined as %quot%method 1%quot% in point 1(b) of Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) no 448/98;
(b) the calculation and allocation of imported and exported FISIM (including FISIM between resident financial intermediaries and non-resident financial intermediaries), using the reference rate defined as the %quot%external%quot% reference rate in point 1(b) of Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) no 448/98;
(c) the allocation of FISIM among user industries, based on the stocks of loans and deposits for each industry or, if this information is not reliable, on the output for each industry;
(d) the calculation of FISIM at constant prices, on the basis of the formula provided in point 3 of Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 448/98.
2. Member States shall transmit to the Commission the results of the calculations made pursuant to this Article as part of the tables referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 (Transmission programme of national accounts data), including backwards calculations from 1995 onwards.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 2014/2002
of 7 November 2002
concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 969/2002(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of the goods referred to in the Annex to this Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 laid down the general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature. Those rules also apply to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivision to it and which is established by specific Community provisions, with a view to the application of tariff and other measures relating to trade in goods.
(3) Pursuant to the said general rules, the goods described in column 1 of the table set out in the Annex to this Regulation should be classified under the CN code(s) indicated in column 2, by virtue of the reasons set out in column 3.
(4) It is appropriate that binding tariff information issued by the customs authorities of Member States in respect of the classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature and which is not in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, can continue to be invoked by the holder, under the provisions of Article 12(6) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), for a period of three months.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 2147/2002
of 2 December 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 1455/1999 laying down the marketing standard for sweet peppers
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1455/1999(3), amended by Regulation (EC) No 2706/2000(4), laid down provisions on the presentation and the marking of packages of sweet peppers.
(2) In order to ensure transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the recent modifications of the standard for sweet peppers recommended by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which stipulates that packages containing peppers of different colours shall not necessarily contain the same number of sweet peppers of each colour provided packages show an appropriate marking. In addition, it is appropriate to lay down that consumer packages may not only contain sweet peppers of different colours but also sweet peppers of different types.
(3) The provisions concerning marking need to be clarified on several points, in particular with regards to the labelling of consumer packages containing sweet peppers of different types and colours.
(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1455/1999.
(5) In order to apply the provisions of the present Regulation, the traders have to proceed to certain technical adaptations, in particular with regard to their packing facilities. The application of the present Regulation shall therefore start after a period of a sufficient length after the date of its entry into force.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1455/1999 is amended according to the Annex to the present Regulation.

It shall apply from the first day of the third month following its entry into force.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Decision of the European Central Bank
of 20 March 2003
on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes
(ECB/2003/4)
(2003/205/EC)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular to Article 106(1) thereof and to Article 16 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank,
Whereas:
(1) Article 106(1) of the Treaty and Article 16 of the Statute provide that the European Central Bank (ECB) has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of banknotes within the Community. These articles also provide that the ECB and the national central banks may issue such notes. Pursuant to Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro(1), the ECB and the national central banks of the participating Member States (hereinafter %quot%NCBs%quot%), shall put euro banknotes into circulation.
(2) The European Monetary Institute (EMI) carried out the preparatory work for the production and issue of euro banknotes, and in particular with regard to the euro banknote designs, it facilitated the recognition and acceptance of the new euro banknote denominations and specifications by users by taking into account the specific visual and technical requirements of European associations of banknote users.
(3) As successor to the EMI the ECB holds the copyright on the designs of the euro banknotes originally held by the EMI. The ECB and the NCBs, acting on behalf of the ECB, may enforce this copyright with regard to reproductions issued or distributed in breach of this copyright, such as, inter alia, reproductions which might adversely affect the standing of euro banknotes.
(4) The ECB's and the NCBs' right to issue euro banknotes includes the competence to take all necessary legal measures to protect the integrity of the euro banknotes as a means of payment. The ECB should take measures to provide for a minimum level of protection in all participating Member States in order to ensure that the general public can distinguish genuine euro banknotes from reproductions. It is therefore necessary to establish common rules according to which the reproduction of euro banknotes will be permitted.
(5) The provisions of the present Decision should be without prejudice to the application of criminal law, in particular regarding counterfeiting.
(6) Reproductions of euro banknotes in electronic form should only be regarded as lawful if the producer thereof adopts adequate technical measures to deter print-outs, where the general public might mistake the print-outs for genuine euro banknotes.
(7) The competence to take measures to protect the integrity of the euro banknotes as a means of payment includes the competence to adopt a common regime under which the NCBs are prepared to exchange mutilated or damaged euro banknotes. Under this regime certain categories of euro banknotes are designated which should be withheld by NCBs when presented to them for exchange.
(8) The part of the original euro banknote that needs to be presented in order to qualify for exchange is subject to minimum measurement requirements. These measurements should be expressed as a percentage of the surface area of the original euro banknote before it was mutilated or damaged, in order to prevent the distortion of measurements, for instance in situations where the euro banknote is mutilated or damaged due to shrinkage.
(9) To encourage the proper handling of anti-theft devices by all professional banknote handlers it is appropriate, when they request NCBs to exchange euro banknotes that have been mutilated or damaged by using anti-theft devices, for NCBs to charge the banknote handlers a fee to compensate for the analysis performed with regard to the exchange of these euro banknotes.
(10) This fee is not charged when the mutilation or damage results from an attempted or actual robbery or theft, and, to avoid insignificant fees, is only charged when a minimum number of mutilated or damaged euro banknotes is presented for exchange.
(11) Euro banknotes which have been mutilated or damaged in bulk due to the use of anti-theft devices should be presented for exchange in sets consisting of a minimum number of euro banknotes.
(12) The ECB's exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes within the Community includes the competence to withdraw euro banknotes and to establish a common regime under which the ECB and the NCBs can perform this withdrawal.
(13) It is appropriate for reasons of clarity and legal certainty to codify Decision ECB/2001/7 of 30 August 2001 on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes(2), as amended by Decision ECB/2001/14(3) and make more transparent the tasks of the ECB and the NCBs with regard to the rules on the reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Denominations and specifications
1. The first series of euro banknotes shall include seven denominations in the range of five euro to 500 euro, depicting the theme %quot%Ages and styles of Europe%quot%, with the following basic specifications.
%gt%TABLE%gt%
2. The seven denominations in the euro banknote series shall bear the representation of gateways and windows on the front side (recto) and bridges on the reverse side (verso). All seven denominations shall be typical of the different European artistic periods referred to above. Other elements of the designs shall include: the symbol of the European Union; the name of the currency in the Roman and Greek alphabets; the initials of the ECB in their official language variants; the © symbol which indicates that the copyright belongs to the ECB; and the signature of the President of the ECB.
Article 2
Reproduction rules for euro banknotes
1. %quot%Reproduction%quot% shall mean any tangible or intangible image that uses all or part of a euro banknote as specified in Article 1, or parts of its individual design elements, such as, inter alia, colour, dimensions and use of letters or symbols, which image may resemble or give the general impression of a euro banknote, irrespective of:
(a) the size of the image; or
(b) the material(s) or technique(s) used to produce it; or
(c) whether or not elements or illustrations have been added to the image that do not originate from banknotes; or
(d) whether or not the design of the euro banknote, such as letters or symbols has been altered.
2. Reproductions which the general public might mistake for genuine euro banknotes shall be deemed unlawful.
3. Reproductions complying with the following criteria shall be deemed lawful since there is no risk that the general public might mistake them for genuine euro banknotes:
(a) one-sided reproductions of a euro banknote as specified in Article 1, provided that the size of the reproduction is at least 125 % of both the length and width or at most 75 % of both the length and the width of the respective euro banknote as specified in Article 1; or
(b) two-sided reproductions of a euro banknote as specified in Article 1, provided that the size of the reproduction is at least 200 % of both the length and width or at most 50 % of both the length and width of the respective euro banknote as specified in Article 1; or
(c) reproductions of individual design elements of a euro banknote as specified in Article 1, provided that such a design element is not depicted on a background resembling a banknote; or
(d) one-sided reproductions depicting a part of the front side or reverse side of a euro banknote, provided that such a part is smaller than one third of the original front side or reverse side of the euro banknote as specified in Article 1; or
(e) reproductions made of a material clearly different from paper, which looks distinctly different from the material used for banknotes; or
(f) intangible reproductions made available electronically on websites, by wire or wireless means or by any other means that allow members of the public to access these intangible reproductions from a place and at a time individually chosen by them, provided that:
- the word SPECIMEN is printed diagonally across the reproduction in Arial font or a font similar to Arial font. The length of the word SPECIMEN is at least 75 % of the length of the reproduction and the height of the word SPECIMEN is at least 15 % of the width of the reproduction, and is in a non-transparent (opaque) colour contrasting with the dominant colour of the respective euro banknote as specified in Article 1, and
- the resolution of the electronic reproduction in its original size does not exceed 72 dpi (dots per inch).
4. The ECB and the NCBs shall, upon receiving a written request, provide confirmation that reproductions not complying with the criteria of paragraph 3, insofar as they cannot be mistaken by the general public for a genuine euro banknote as specified in Article 1, are also lawful. Where a reproduction is produced in the territory of only one participating Member State, requests as referred to above shall be addressed to the NCB of that Member State. In all other cases, such requests shall be addressed to the ECB.
5. Reproduction rules for euro banknotes also apply to euro banknotes that have been withdrawn or have lost their legal tender status under this Decision.
Article 3
Exchange of mutilated or damaged euro banknotes
1. NCBs shall, upon request, and under the conditions laid down in paragraph 2, exchange mutilated or damaged genuine legal tender euro banknotes in the following cases:
(a) when more than 50 % of the euro banknote is presented; or
(b) when 50 % or less of the euro banknote is presented if the applicant proves that the missing parts have been destroyed.
2. Further to paragraph 1 the following additional conditions apply to the exchange of mutilated or damaged legal tender euro banknotes:
(a) where doubt exists as to the applicant's legal title to the euro banknotes or as to the authenticity of the euro banknotes: identification shall be provided by the applicant;
(b) when ink-stained, contaminated or impregnated euro banknotes are presented: a written explanation as to the kind of stain, contamination or impregnation shall be provided by the applicant;
(c) when the euro banknotes have been discoloured by activated anti-theft devices and they are presented by professional banknote handlers as referred to in Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 of 28 June 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting(4): a written statement on the cause and the nature of neutralisation shall be provided by the professional banknote handlers;
(d) when the euro banknotes have been mutilated or damaged in bulk due to the use of anti-theft devices: they shall be presented in sets of 100 euro banknotes, provided that the amount of euro banknotes presented is sufficient to form such sets.
3. Notwithstanding the above:
(a) Where NCBs know or have sufficient reason to believe that the euro banknotes have been intentionally mutilated or damaged, they shall refuse to exchange and shall withhold the euro banknotes, in order to avoid the return of such euro banknotes into circulation or to prevent the applicant from presenting them to another NCB for exchange. However, they will exchange the mutilated or damaged euro banknotes if they either know or have sufficient reason to believe that applicants are bona fide, or if applicants can prove that they are bona fide. Euro banknotes which are mutilated or damaged to a minor degree, e.g. by having annotations, numbers or brief sentences placed on them, will in principle not be considered to be intentionally mutilated or damaged euro banknotes; and
(b) Where NCBs know or have sufficient reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed they shall refuse to exchange the mutilated or damaged euro banknotes and shall withhold them, against acknowledgement of receipt, as evidence to be presented to the competent authorities to initiate or to support an ongoing criminal investigation. Unless otherwise decided by the competent authorities, the euro banknotes shall be returned to the applicant at the end of the investigation and shall thereafter qualify for exchange.
Article 4
Establishment of a fee for the exchange of mutilated or damaged euro banknotes
1. NCBs shall charge professional banknote handlers a fee when they request NCBs, in accordance with Article 3, to exchange legal tender euro banknotes that have been mutilated or damaged by using anti-theft devices.
2. The fee shall amount to 10 cents per mutilated or damaged euro banknote.
3. The fee shall only be charged if at least 100 mutilated or damaged euro banknotes are exchanged. The fee shall be charged for all exchanged euro banknotes.
4. No fee shall be charged where euro banknotes have been mutilated or damaged in connection with an attempted or actual robbery or theft.
Article 5
Withdrawal of euro banknotes
The withdrawal of a euro banknote type or series shall be regulated by a decision of the Governing Council published for general information in the Official Journal of the European Union and other media. This Decision shall cover, as a minimum, the following points:
- the euro banknote type or series to be withdrawn from circulation, and
- the duration of the exchange period, and
- the date on which the euro banknote type or series will lose its legal tender status, and
- the treatment of the euro banknotes presented once the withdrawal period is over and/or they have lost their legal tender status.
Article 6
Final provisions
1. Decisions ECB/2001/7 and ECB/2001/14 are hereby repealed.
2. References to Decisions ECB/1998/6(5), ECB/1999/2(6), ECB/2001/7 and ECB/2001/14 shall be construed as references to this Decision.

Council Decision
of 16 December 2002
on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2003/17/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed(1), and in particular Article 16(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed(2), and in particular Article 16(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/54/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of beet seed(3), and in particular Article 23(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants(4), and in particular Article 20(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The rules on official seed control in Argentina, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Morocco, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Turkey, the United States of America, Uruguay, Yugoslavia and South Africa provide for an official field inspection to be carried out during the period of seed production.
(2) Those rules provide in principle that seed may be officially certified and seed packages officially closed in accordance with the OECD Schemes for the Varietal Certification of Seed moving in International Trade. The rules also provide for seed sampling and testing in accordance with the methods of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA), or where appropriate, in accordance with the rules of the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA).
(3) An examination of those rules and the manner in which they are applied in the aforementioned third countries has shown that the field inspection of seed-producing crops satisfies the conditions laid down in Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in those countries afford the same assurances as regards the seed's characteristics and the arrangements for its examination, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the Community, provided that further conditions for seed-producing crops and seed produced, in particular in respect of packages marking, are satisfied.
(4) Council Decision 95/514/EC of 29 November 1995 on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries(5) provides that for a limited period field inspections carried out in certain third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species are considered as equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Community legislation and that seed of certain species produced in those countries is considered as equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Community legislation.
(5) As Decision 95/514/EC will expire on 31 December 2002, a new decision should be adopted and its scope extended in particular by including Estonia, Latvia and Yugoslavia.
(6) It appears desirable to limit the period for which equivalence is recognised under this Decision to five years.
(7) It is appropriate to include in this Decision specific rules concerning relabelling and refastening in the Community incorporating rules similar to those provided by Decision 86/110/EEC(6), which is no longer applicable.
(8) The existing legislation already provides for an obligation for seed, including not finally certified seed, marketed in the Community to indicate whether the seed is chemically treated or the variety has been genetically modified. It is appropriate to provide for detailed rules on the exact indications to be given on the label of certified seed imported under this Decision. It is appropriate for these rules to mirror the ones provided by Decision 95/514/EC. It will be appropriate in future to update the annexes of the present Decision in order to ensure that imported seed is subject to requirements equivalent to any new rules which may be introduced, especially for not finally certified seed.
(9) Certain amendments to the Annexes to this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedure for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Field inspections concerning the seed-producing crops of the species specified in Annex I carried out in the third countries listed in that Annex, excluding seed of generations prior to basic seed, shall be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC provided that they:
(a) are carried out officially by the authorities listed in Annex I, or under the official supervision of those authorities;
(b) satisfy the conditions laid down in point A of Annex II.
Article 2
Seed of the species specified in Annex I, produced in the third countries listed in that Annex and officially certified by the authorities listed in that Annex, excluding seed of generations prior to basic seed, shall be considered equivalent to seed complying with Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC, if it satisfies the conditions laid down in point B of Annex II.
Article 3
1. Where equivalent seed is %quot%relabelled and refastened%quot% in the Community, within the meaning of OECD Schemes for the Varietal Certification of Seed moving in International Trade, the provisions of Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/54/EC and 2002/57/EC concerning the reclosing of packages produced in the Community shall apply by analogy.
The first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the OECD rules applicable to such operations.
2. Where relabelling and refastening in the Community of equivalent seed is necessary, EC labels shall be used only:
(a) if seeds produced in Member States and seeds of the same variety and category produced in third countries are blended in order to improve the germination capacity, provided that:
- the blend is homogeneous, and
- the label mentions each country of production; or
(b) for small EC packages within the meaning of Directives 66/401/EEC or 2002/54/EC.
Article 4
Amendments to the Annexes, with the exception of those concerning column 1 of the table in Annex I, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5.
Article 5
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry.
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 4 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.
The period laid down in Article 4(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at one month.
3. The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part(1), provides for certain reciprocal trade concessions for certain agricultural products.
(2) Article 21(5) of the Europe Agreement provides that the Community and Romania is to examine product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis the possibilities of granting each other further concessions.
(3) The first improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were provided for in the Protocol for the adaptation of the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement to take into account the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the results of the agricultural negotiations of the Uruguay Round, including improvements to the existing preferential regime, approved by Council Decision 98/626/EC(2).
(4) Improvements to the preferential arrangements were also provided for as a result of negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade concluded in 2000. On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 July 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Romania(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol.
(5) Negotiations for further improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were concluded on 18 June 2002.
(6) The new Protocol to the Europe Agreement adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the Protocol) should be approved with a view to consolidating all concessions in agricultural trade between the two sides, including the results of the negotiations concluded in 2000 and 2002.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4) has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Certain tariff quotas under this Decision should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).
(9) As a result of the aforementioned negotiations, Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 has been superseded and should therefore be repealed,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1

Commission Decision
of 18 March 2003
on the publication of the reference of standard EN 613:2000 %quot%Independent gas-fired convection heaters%quot% in accordance with Council Directive 90/396/EEC
(notified under document number C(2003) 710)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2003/189/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/396/EEC of 29 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to appliances burning gaseous fuels(1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society Services(3), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC(4),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Directive 90/396/EEC stipulates that gas appliances may be placed on the market and put into service only if, when normally used, they do not compromise the safety of persons, domestic animals and property.
(2) Under Article 5 of Directive 90/396/EEC, gas appliances are presumed to comply with the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 of that Directive if they conform to the national standards applicable to them transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(3) Member States are required to publish the reference numbers of national standards transposing harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(4) The United Kingdom raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standard EN 613:2000 %quot%Independent gas-fired convection heaters%quot%, adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 13 July 2000, the reference number of which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 18 July 2001(5), on the grounds that it does not fully satisfy the essential requirements of Directive 90/396/EEC, especially those under points 2.1 and 3.2.2 of Annex I, thereto, because the design requirements for decorative glass-fronted fires are not sufficient to ensure a high level of safety. The United Kingdom is particularly concerned that, in case of such products, a dangerous situation could arise should a build up of gas occur, because the accumulated unburned gas could then ignite, causing serious injury.
(5) On the basis of the information received in the framework of the consultation of the national authorities, of CEN and of the Committee set up by Directive 98/34/EC, no evidence was found to substantiate the risk of gas accumulation or gas explosion. Consequently, it has not been demonstrated that harmonised standard EN 613:2000 fails to meet the essential requirements of Directive 90/396/EEC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The reference of standard EN 613:2000 %quot%Independent gas-fired convection heaters%quot%, adopted by the European Committee For Standardisation (CEN) on 13 July 2000 and published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 18 July 2001, shall not be withdrawn from the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The standard shall therefore continue to confer the presumption of conformity to the relevant provisions of Directive 90/396/EEC.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Council Decision

Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2002/44/EC of 20 December 2001 amending Part VII and Annex 12 to the Common Consular Instructions and Annex 14a to the Common Manual(3) established that the fees to be levied in connection with an application for a visa correspond to the administrative costs incurred. The Common Consular Instructions and the Common Manual should therefore be amended accordingly.
(2) The amount to be charged should be revised at regular intervals.
(3) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law.
(4) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(5).
(5) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 19 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(6); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(6) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(7); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(7) This Decision constitutes an act building upon the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

Directive 2003/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 14 April 2003
on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Within the framework of the common transport policy further measures should be taken to improve safety in maritime transport of passengers.
(2) The Community wishes to avoid by all appropriate means shipping accidents involving ro-ro passenger ships and resulting in loss of life.
(3) The survivability of ro-ro passenger ships following collision damage, as determined by their damage stability standard, is an essential factor for the safety of passengers and crew and is particularly relevant for search and rescue operations; the most dangerous problem for the stability of a ro-ro passenger ship with an enclosed ro-ro deck, following collision damage, is the one posed by the effect of a build up of significant amounts of water on that deck.
(4) Persons using ro-ro passenger ships and crew employed on board such vessels throughout the Community should have the right to demand the same high level of safety regardless of the area in which ships operate.
(5) In view of the internal market dimension of maritime transport of passengers, action at Community level is the most effective way of establishing a common minimum level of safety for ships throughout the Community.
(6) Action at Community level is the best way to ensure the harmonised enforcement of principles agreed on within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), thus avoiding distortions of competition between the operators of ro-ro passenger ships operating in the Community.
(7) General stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships in damaged condition were established at international level by the 1990 Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS 90) Conference and were included in Regulation II-1/B/8 of the SOLAS Convention (SOLAS 90 standard). These requirements are applicable in the entire Community owing to the direct application to international voyages of the SOLAS Convention and the application to domestic voyages of Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships(4).
(8) The SOLAS 90 damage stability standard implicitly includes the effect of water entering the ro-ro deck in a sea state of the order of 1,5 m significant wave height.
(9) IMO Resolution 14 of the 1995 SOLAS Conference, allowed IMO members to conclude regional agreements if they consider that prevailing sea conditions and other local conditions require specific stability requirements in a designated area.
(10) Eight northern European countries, including seven Member States, agreed in Stockholm on 28 February 1996 to introduce a higher stability standard for ro-ro passenger ships in damaged condition in order to take into account the effect of water accumulation on the ro-ro deck and to enable the ship to survive in more severe states than the SOLAS 90 standard, up to 4 m significant wave heights.
(11) Under this agreement, known as the Stockholm Agreement, the specific stability standard is directly related to the sea area in which the vessel operates and more particularly to the significant wave height recorded in the area of operation; the significant wave height of the area where the ship operates determines the height of water on the car deck that would arise following the occurrence of accidental damage.
(12) At the conclusion of the Conference at which the Stockholm Agreement was adopted, the Commission noted that the Agreement was not applicable in other parts of the Community and announced its intention to examine the prevailing local conditions under which ro-ro passenger ships sail in all European waters and to take appropriate initiatives.
(13) The Council entered a statement in the minutes of the 2074th Council meeting of 17 March 1998 stressing the need to ensure the same level of safety for all passenger ferries operating in similar conditions, whether on international or on domestic voyages.
(14) In its Resolution of 5 October 2000 on the sinking of the Greek ferry %quot%Samina%quot%(5), the European Parliament expressly stated that it awaited the evaluation by the Commission of the effectiveness of the Stockholm Agreement and other measures for improving the stability and safety of passenger ships.
(15) Following an expert study by the Commission, the wave height conditions in south European waters were found to be similar to those in the north. While meteorological conditions may be generally more favourable in the south, the stability standard determined in the context of the Stockholm Agreement is based solely on the significant wave height parameter and the way this influences the accumulation of water on the ro-ro deck.
(16) The application of Community safety standards regarding the stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships is essential for the safety of these vessels and has to be part of the common maritime safety framework.
(17) In the interests of improving safety and avoiding distortion of competition, the common safety standards regarding stability should apply to all ro-ro passenger ships, regardless of the flag that they fly, providing regular services to or from a port in the Member States on international voyages.
(18) The safety of ships is primarily the responsibility of flag States and therefore each Member State should ensure compliance with the safety requirements applicable to the ro-ro passenger ships flying the flag of that Member State.
(19) Member States should also be addressed in their capacity as host States. The responsibilities exercised in that capacity are based on specific port State responsibilities that are fully in line with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).
(20) The specific stability requirements introduced by this Directive should be based on a method, as set out in the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement, which calculates the height of water on the ro-ro deck following collision damage in relation to two basic parameters: the ship's residual freeboard and the significant wave height in the sea area where the ship operates.
(21) Member States should determine and publicise the significant wave heights in the sea areas crossed by ro-ro passenger ships on regular service to or from their ports. For international routes the significant wave heights should, wherever applicable and possible, be established in agreement between the States at both ends of the route. Significant wave heights for seasonal operation in the same sea areas may also be determined.
(22) Every ro-ro passenger ship engaged in voyages within the scope of this Directive should fulfil the stability requirements in relation to the significant wave heights determined for its area of operation. It should carry a certificate of compliance issued by the Administration of the flag State, which should be accepted by all other Member States.
(23) The SOLAS 90 Standard provides a level of safety equivalent to the specific stability requirements established by this Directive for ships operating in sea areas where the significant wave height is equal to or less than 1,5 m.
(24) In view of the structural modifications that the existing ro-ro passenger ships may need to undergo in order to comply with the specific stability requirements, those requirements should be introduced over a period of years in order to allow to the part of the industry affected sufficient time to comply: to that end, a phasing-in timetable for existing ships should be provided. This phasing-in timetable should not affect the enforcement of the specific stability requirements in the sea areas covered by the Annexes to the Stockholm Agreement.
(25) Article 4(1)(e) of Council Directive 1999/35/EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services(6) provides that host States are to check that ro-ro passenger ferries and high-speed passenger craft comply with specific stability requirements adopted at regional level and transposed into their national legislation, when these ships operate a service covered by that national legislation in the region concerned.
(26) High-speed passenger craft as defined in Regulation 1 of Chapter X of the SOLAS Convention, as amended, should not be required to comply with the provisions of this Directive, provided that they comply entirely with the provisions of the IMO %quot%International code for safety of high-speed craft%quot%, as amended.
(27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).
(28) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to safeguard human life at sea by improving the survivability of ro-ro passenger ships in the event of damage, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Purpose
The purpose of this Directive is to lay down a uniform level of specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships, which will improve the survivability of this type of vessel in case of collision damage and provide a high level of safety for the passengers and the crew.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two- and three-wheel motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive 92/61/EEC(1), and in particular Article 17 thereof,
Having regard to Directive 97/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1997 on certain components and characteristics of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(2), as amended by Directive 2002/51/EC(3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 97/24/EC is one of the separate Directives for the purposes of the EC type-approval procedure laid down by Council Directive 92/61/EEC(4), which is to be repealed by Directive 2002/24/EC with effect from 9 November 2003.
(2) Directive 2002/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two- and three-wheel motor vehicles and amending Directive 97/24/EC introduced new emission limit values for two-wheel motorcycles. Those limit values are applicable in two stages, the first stage with effect from 1 April 2003 for any type of vehicle and the second stage with effect from 1 January 2006 for new types. For the second stage, the measurement of pollutant emissions from two-wheel motorcycles is based on the use of the elementary urban test cycle laid down in UN-ECE Regulation No 40 and the extra-urban driving cycle laid down in Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from motor vehicles(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/80/EC(6).
(3) Directive 97/24/EC, as amended by Directive 2002/51/EC, specified the Type I test cycle for measuring pollutant emissions from two- and three-wheel motor vehicles. That test cycle should be completed by the Commission, through the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC, and should be applicable from 2006.
(4) It is necessary to clarify certain aspects of the Type II test data for annual roadworthiness testing, as required by Directive 2002/51/EC, and to provide for the recording of that test data in Annex VII to Directive 2002/24/EC.
(5) Directives 97/24/EC and 2002/24/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Annex II to Chapter 5 of Directive 97/24/EC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.

They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive.
They shall apply those provisions from 4 September 2004.
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

of 12 May 2003
amending Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal-by-products not intended for human consumption(1), and in particular Articles 12(5) and 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Scientific Steering Committee issued an opinion on 16 and 17 January 2003 on the safety vis-à-vis TSEs of the use of low-capacity incineration plants and co-incineration plants for incinerating potentially TSE infected animal materials.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1458/2003
of 18 August 2003
opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota in the pigmeat sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2), and in particular Article 8(2), Article 11(1) and the second subparagraph of Article 22 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations(3), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1486/95 of 28 June 1995 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota in the pigmeat sector(4) has been substantially amended several times(5). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) In the framework of the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations, the Community negotiated various agreements, in particular that on agriculture. The agreement allows, among others, certain products in the pigmeat sector coming from third countries access to the Community market. It is now possible to establish specific rules of application for the pigmeat sector.
(3) The agreement calls for the suppression of variable import levies by converting into customs duties all the measures which restrict the import of agricultural products.
(4) The administration of the arrangements should be based on import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences, by way of derogation from Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(7), should be laid down. Provision should also be made for the licences to be issued after a period for consideration and, where necessary, a single percentage should be applied to determine the quantity awarded in respect of each application. In the interests of traders, provision should be made for the withdrawal of applications after the fixing of the coefficient to be applied.
(5) For reasons of clarity, it should be laid down that all imports under a tariff quota must be subject to the presentation of an import licence. The threshold quantity beyond which traders may withdraw their licence application after the application of the single percentage of acceptance should be laid down.
(6) In order to facilitate trade between the European Community and third countries, it must be possible to import pigmeat products without an obligation to import from the country of origin, which must nevertheless be mentioned for statistical reasons in section 8 of the import licence.
(7) In order to ensure that imports are regular, it is necessary to define products covered by the import regime and to ensure that those quantities referred to in Annex I are spread over the period from 1 July to 30 June.
(8) In order to ensure proper administration of the arrangements, the security for import licences under the system should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kg. In view of the arrangements' inherent risk of speculation as regards pigmeat, clear conditions should be laid down as regards access by operators.
(9) It is appropriate to draw the attention of operators to the fact that licences may only be used for products which comply with all veterinary rules currently in force in the Community.
(10) To ensure proper management of the import regimes, the Commission needs precise information from the Member States on the quantities actually imported. For the sake of clarity it is necessary to use a single model for communicating the quantities between Member States and the Commission.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The import tariff quotas provided for in Annex I shall be opened annually for the groups of products referred to therein and for the conditions laying them down.
Article 2
In accordance with the present Regulation, products of CN codes ex 0203 19 55 and ex 0203 29 55 referred to in groups G2 and G3 of Annex I have the following meanings assigned to them:

- %quot%tenderloin%quot%, cuts including the meats of muscles muscumus major psoas and musculus minor psoas, with or without head, trimmed or not trimmed.
Article 3
The tariff quotas provided for in Annex I shall be divided into quarterly figures of 25 % applicable from 1 July, 1 October, 1 January and 1 April.
Article 4
The import licences for the tariff quotas provided for in Annex I shall be subject to the following provisions:
(a) applicants for import licences must be natural or legal persons who, at the time of application, must prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have been engaged in trade with third countries in pigmeat products for at least the preceding 12 months; however, retail and catering establishments selling their products to final consumers shall be excluded from the regime;
(b) licence applications may refer to only one of the group numbers set out in Annex I to this Regulation and may relate to more than one product covered by different CN codes and originating from only one country; in such cases, all the CN codes shall be indicated in section 16 and their descriptions in section 15; for group G2, licence applications must relate to at least 20 tonnes and to a maximum of 10 % of the quantity available for the period as specified in Article 3; for the other groups, licence applications must relate to at least one tonne and to a maximum of 10 % of the quantity available for the period as specified in Article 3;

They shall be considered, as regards the maximum referred to in Article 4(b) as well as application of the rule set out in subparagraph 2 of paragraph 2, as a single application.
4. A security of EUR 20 per 100 kilograms shall be lodged for import licence applications for all products set out in Annex I.
5. On the third working day following the end of the application submission period, the Member States shall notify the Commission of applications lodged for each of the products in the groups concerned.

All notifications, including %quot%nil%quot% notifications, shall be made by telex or fax on the working day stipulated, using the model shown in Annex II in cases where no applications have been made, and the models shown in Annexes II and III in cases where applications have been made.
6. The Commission shall decide as quickly as possible what quantities may be awarded in respect of applications referred to in Article 4.
If the quantities in respect of which licences have been applied for exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall fix a single percentage of acceptance of the quantities applied for. In the case where the percentage is less than 5 %, the Commission may refuse all applications and the corresponding security shall be released immediately.
7. The trader may withdraw his licence application within 10 working days of publication of the single percentage of acceptance in the Official Journal of the European Union where application of that rate results in the fixing of a quantity of less than 20 tonnes for group G2 and less than one tonne for the other groups.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 2011/2003
of 14 November 2003
amending Annexes I and III to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1873/2003(2), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Alphacypermethrin and Metamizole should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, Phoxim should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC(3) of the European Parliament and of the Council to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING REGULATION:
Article 1
Annexes I and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from the 60th day following its publication.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2314/2003
of 29 December 2003
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of rye held by the German intervention agency
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(2) provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) Germany still has intervention stocks of rye.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereal production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of rye held by the German intervention agency available on the internal market. The period of presentation of the offers for the last partial invitation to tender under Regulation (EC) No 1510/2003(3) having expired on 18 December 2003, it is advisable to open a new standing invitation to tender.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.
(6) When the German intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.
(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The German intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 1139000 tonnes of rye held by it.
Article 2
The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.
However, notwithstanding that Regulation:
(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply;
(b) the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market.
Article 3
Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security is set at EUR 10 per tonne.
Article 4
1. The closing date for the submission of tenders for the first partial invitation to tender shall be 8 January 2004 at 09.00 (Brussels time).
The closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Thursday at 09.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 8 April and 20 May 2004.
The closing date for the submission of tenders for the last partial tendering procedure shall be 27 May 2004 at 09.00 (Brussels time).
2. Tenders shall be lodged with the German intervention agency: Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung (BLE) Adickesallee 40 D - 60322 Frankfurt am Main Fax: (49-691) 56 49 62
Article 5
Within two hours of the expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders, the German intervention agency shall notify the Commission of tenders received. They must be sent by electronic mail in accordance with the form set out in the Annex.
Article 6
In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, the Commission shall set the minimum sale price or decide not to accept the tenders. If tenders are submitted for the same lot and for a total quantity larger than that available, a separate price may be fixed for each lot.
Where tenders offer the minimum selling price, the Commission may fix an award coefficient for the quantities offered at the same time as it sets the minimum selling price.
Article 7
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Decision
of 11 February 2004
concerning the non-inclusion of fenthion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance
(notified under document number C(2004) 313)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2004/140/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/119/EC(2), and in particular the third and the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), and in particular Article 7(3A)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 25 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Fenthion is one of the 89 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 4 April 1996 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifier Bayer CropScience as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(6) The Commission organised two tripartite meetings with the main data submitter and the rapporteur Member State for this active substance on 18 April 1997 and 11 February 2003.
(7) The assessment report prepared by Greece has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This review was finalised on 4 July 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for fenthion.
(8) The dossier and the information from the review were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants (SCP). The SCP was asked to comment on the establishment of an Acceptable Daily Intake and an Acceptable Operator Exposure Level. In its first opinion of 2 October 1998, and based on the conclusions of the human and environmental risk assessment, the SCP considered that it was not possible to complete a full assessment in the absence of data to prove that even the limited intended use as bait application on citrus and olive was safe for human health and the environment. The SCP particularly noted the very high acute risk for birds. In that opinion, the SCP acknowledged that the development of an innovative technique of application, namely bait formulation including fenthion plus attractant on only a part of the crop, might be promising to achieve limited exposure of humans and the environment; however it noted that specific studies would have to be made available on such a type of application before a conclusive evaluation could be made.
Additional information, in particular in relation to the bait application use, has subsequently been submitted by Bayer CropScience and has been evaluated. The additional information and its evaluation has been submitted to the SCP. In its opinion of 17 December 2002 the SCP concluded that the risk to birds from the proposed uses of fenthion remained uncertain. As a result, the concerns in relation to possible risks to birds raised in its previous opinion remained unresolved.
(9) Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing fenthion satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to its possible impact on birds.
(10) Fenthion should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(11) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing fenthion are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(12) In the light of the information submitted to the Commission it appears that, in the absence of efficient alternatives for certain limited uses in certain Member States, there is a need for further use of the active substance so as to enable the development of alternatives. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available for the control of harmful organisms.
(13) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing fenthion allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(14) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(8).
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Fenthion shall not be included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
Article 2
Member States shall ensure that:
1. Authorisations for plant protection products containing fenthion are withdrawn by 11 August 2004;
2. from 17 February 2004 no authorisations for plant protection products containing fenthion are granted or renewed under the derogation provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC;
3. In relation to the uses listed in column B of the Annex, a Member State specified in column A may maintain in force authorisations for plant protection products containing fenthion until 30 June 2007 provided that it:
(a) ensures that such plant protection products remaining on the market are relabelled in order to match the restricted use conditions;
(b) imposes all appropriate risk mitigation measures to reduce any possible risks in order to ensure the protection of human and animal health and the environment; and
(c) ensures that alternative products or methods for such uses are being seriously sought, in particular, by means of action plans.
The Member State concerned shall inform the Commission on 31 December 2004 at the latest on the application of this paragraph and in particular on the actions taken pursuant to points (a) to (c) and provide on a yearly basis estimates of the amounts of fenthion used for essential uses pursuant to this Article.
Article 3
Any period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and:
(a) for the uses for which the authorisation is to be withdrawn on 11 August 2004, shall expire not later than 11 August 2005;
(b) for the uses for which the authorisation is to be withdrawn by 30 June 2007, shall expire not later than 31 December 2007.

Council Recommendation
of 14 October 2004
on the implementation of Member States' employment policies
(2004/741/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 128(4) thereof,
Having regard to the Commission recommendation,
Having regard to the opinion of the Employment Committee,
Whereas:
(1) The European Employment Strategy has the leading role in the implementation of the employment and labour market objectives of the Lisbon strategy. The successful implementation of the Lisbon agenda calls for the employment policies of Member States to foster, in a balanced manner, the three complementary and mutually supportive objectives of full employment, quality and productivity at work, and social cohesion and inclusion. The achievement of these objectives requires further structural reforms concentrating on 10 key specific priorities and improved governance.
(2) The reform of the European Employment Strategy in 2003 has placed the emphasis on medium-term orientation and on the importance of implementation of the full range of policies recommended in the Employment Guidelines. The Employment Guidelines should therefore be fully reviewed only every three years, while in the intermediate years their updating should remain strictly limited.
(3) The Council adopted without change the Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States in 2004 by Decision 2004/740/EC [1].
(4) The Council adopted a recommendation on the implementation of Member States' employment policies on 22 July 2003 [2]. The examination of the Member States' National Action Plans for employment contained in the Joint Employment Report 2003-2004 shows that Member States and the social partners have given limited responses to these Council recommendations.
(5) The European Employment Taskforce recommended that the EU should address more forceful recommendations to the Member States. Priority should be given to increasing adaptability of workers and enterprises; attracting more people to enter and remain on the labour market, making work a real option for all; investing more and more effectively in human capital and lifelong learning; and ensuring effective implementation of reforms through better governance. The Council and the Commission share this assessment and have integrated the policy messages of the Employment Taskforce report in the Joint Employment Report.
(6) The analysis of the implementation of the Guidelines and 2003 Council recommendations in the Joint Employment Report and the general and country-specific policy messages in the Employment Taskforce report provide the basis for the formulation of the EU recommendations for national employment policies in 2004.
(7) The Employment Guidelines apply to the new Member States since accession. All of the new Member States have reported over the last few years on the implementation of Joint Assessment Papers (JAP) which refer to the Employment Guidelines. To successfully pursue the on-going restructuring of their economies, most new Member States, together with the social partners, need to further develop their efforts to modernise their employment policies. A new balance between flexibility and security, increased participation in employment and investment in human capital through lifelong learning are essential, as is the need to improve the health of the workforce. Social partnership, and significant improvements in the administrative capacity of public authorities are still crucial in most new Member States to achieve full implementation and efficient use of European Social Fund support, a major tool for investing in human capital and lifelong learning.
(8) The country-specific messages contained in the report of the European Employment Taskforce are fully consistent with the examination of the JAP implementation reports, and may serve as guidance for the implementation of the Employment Guidelines in the new Member States,
Council Directive 2004/113/EC
of 13 December 2004
implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 13(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament [1],
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2],
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [3],
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States, and respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States as general principles of Community law.
(2) The right to equality before the law and protection against discrimination for all persons constitutes a universal right recognised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the United Nations Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which all Member States are signatories.
(3) While prohibiting discrimination, it is important to respect other fundamental rights and freedoms, including the protection of private and family life and transactions carried out in that context and the freedom of religion.
(4) Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibit any discrimination on grounds of sex and require equality between men and women to be ensured in all areas.
(5) Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides that promoting such equality is one of the Community's essential tasks. Similarly, Article 3(2) of the Treaty requires the Community to aim to eliminate inequalities and to promote equality between men and women in all its activities.
(6) The Commission announced its intention of proposing a directive on sex discrimination outside of the labour market in its Communication on the Social Policy Agenda. Such a proposal is fully consistent with Council Decision 2001/51/EC of 20 December 2000 establishing a Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) [4] covering all Community policies and aimed at promoting equality for men and women by adjusting these policies and implementing practical measures to improve the situation of men and women in society.
(7) At its meeting in Nice of 7 and 9 December 2000, the European Council called on the Commission to reinforce equality-related rights by adopting a proposal for a directive on promoting gender equality in areas other than employment and professional life.
(8) The Community has adopted a range of legal instruments to prevent and combat sex discrimination in the labour market. These instruments have demonstrated the value of legislation in the fight against discrimination.
(9) Discrimination based on sex, including harassment and sexual harassment, also takes place in areas outside of the labour market. Such discrimination can be equally damaging, acting as a barrier to the full and successful integration of men and women into economic and social life.
(10) Problems are particularly apparent in the area of the access to and supply of goods and services. Discrimination based on sex, should therefore be prevented and eliminated in this area. As in the case of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin [5], this objective can be better achieved by means of Community legislation.
(11) Such legislation should prohibit discrimination based on sex in the access to and supply of goods and services. Goods should be taken to be those within the meaning of the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community relating to the free movement of goods. Services should be taken to be those within the meaning of Article 50 of that Treaty.
(12) To prevent discrimination based on sex, this Directive should apply to both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs only when one person is treated less favourably, on grounds of sex, than another person in a comparable situation. Accordingly, for example, differences between men and women in the provision of healthcare services, which result from the physical differences between men and women, do not relate to comparable situations and therefore, do not constitute discrimination.
(13) The prohibition of discrimination should apply to persons providing goods and services, which are available to the public and which are offered outside the area of private and family life and the transactions carried out in this context. It should not apply to the content of media or advertising nor to public or private education.
(14) All individuals enjoy the freedom to contract, including the freedom to choose a contractual partner for a transaction. An individual who provides goods or services may have a number of subjective reasons for his or her choice of contractual partner. As long as the choice of partner is not based on that person's sex, this Directive should not prejudice the individual's freedom to choose a contractual partner.
(15) There are already a number of existing legal instruments for the implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of employment and occupation. Therefore, this Directive should not apply in this field. The same reasoning applies to matters of self-employment insofar as they are covered by existing legal instruments. The Directive should apply only to insurance and pensions which are private, voluntary and separate from the employment relationship.
(16) Differences in treatment may be accepted only if they are justified by a legitimate aim. A legitimate aim may, for example, be the protection of victims of sex-related violence (in cases such as the establishment of single-sex shelters), reasons of privacy and decency (in cases such as the provision of accommodation by a person in a part of that person's home), the promotion of gender equality or of the interests of men or women (for example single-sex voluntary bodies), the freedom of association (in cases of membership of single-sex private clubs), and the organisation of sporting activities (for example single-sex sports events). Any limitation should nevertheless be appropriate and necessary in accordance with the criteria derived from case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
(17) The principle of equal treatment in the access to goods and services does not require that facilities should always be provided to men and women on a shared basis, as long as they are not provided more favourably to members of one sex.
(18) The use of actuarial factors related to sex is widespread in the provision of insurance and other related financial services. In order to ensure equal treatment between men and women, the use of sex as an actuarial factor should not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits. To avoid a sudden readjustment of the market, the implementation of this rule should apply only to new contracts concluded after the date of transposition of this Directive.
(19) Certain categories of risks may vary between the sexes. In some cases, sex is one but not necessarily the only determining factor in the assessment of risks insured. For contracts insuring those types of risks, Member States may decide to permit exemptions from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits, as long as they can ensure that underlying actuarial and statistical data on which the calculations are based, are reliable, regularly up-dated and available to the public. Exemptions are allowed only where national legislation has not already applied the unisex rule. Five years after transposition of this Directive, Member States should re-examine the justification for these exemptions, taking into account the most recent actuarial and statistical data and a report by the Commission three years after the date of transposition of this Directive.
(20) Less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity should be considered a form of direct discrimination based on sex and therefore prohibited in insurance and related financial services. Costs related to risks of pregnancy and maternity should therefore not be attributed to the members of one sex only.
(21) Persons who have been subject to discrimination based on sex should have adequate means of legal protection. To provide a more effective level of protection, associations, organisations and other legal entities should also be empowered to engage in proceedings, as the Member States so determine, either on behalf or in support of any victim, without prejudice to national rules of procedure concerning representation and defence before the courts.
(22) The rules on the burden of proof should be adapted when there is a prima facie case of discrimination and for the principle of equal treatment to be applied effectively, the burden of proof should shift back to the defendant when evidence of such discrimination is brought.
(23) The effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment requires adequate judicial protection against victimisation.
(24) With a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment, Member States should encourage dialogue with relevant stakeholders, which have, in accordance with national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services.
(25) Protection against discrimination based on sex should itself be strengthened by the existence of a body or bodies in each Member State, with competence to analyse the problems involved, to study possible solutions and to provide concrete assistance for the victims. The body or bodies may be the same as those with responsibility at national level for the defence of human rights or the safeguarding of individuals' rights, or the implementation of the principle of equal treatment.
(26) This Directive lays down minimum requirements, thus giving the Member States the option of introducing or maintaining more favourable provisions. The implementation of this Directive should not serve to justify any regression in relation to the situation, which already prevails in each Member State.
(27) Member States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in cases of breaches of the obligations under this Directive.
(28) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure a common high level of protection against discrimination in all the Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(29) In accordance with paragraph 34 of the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making [6], Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between the Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
CHAPTER I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 1
Purpose
The purpose of this Directive is to lay down a framework for combating discrimination based on sex in access to and supply of goods and services, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment between men and women.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) direct discrimination: where one person is treated less favourably, on grounds of sex, than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation;
(b) indirect discrimination: where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary;
(c) harassment: where an unwanted conduct related to the sex of a person occurs with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment;
(d) sexual harassment: where any form of unwanted physical, verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.
Article 3
Scope
1. Within the limits of the powers conferred upon the Community, this Directive shall apply to all persons who provide goods and services, which are available to the public irrespective of the person concerned as regards both the public and private sectors, including public bodies, and which are offered outside the area of private and family life and the transactions carried out in this context.
2. This Directive does not prejudice the individual's freedom to choose a contractual partner as long as an individual's choice of contractual partner is not based on that person's sex.
3. This Directive shall not apply to the content of media and advertising nor to education.
4. This Directive shall not apply to matters of employment and occupation. This Directive shall not apply to matters of self-employment, insofar as these matters are covered by other Community legislative acts.
Article 4
Principle of equal treatment
1. For the purposes of this Directive, the principle of equal treatment between men and women shall mean that
(a) there shall be no direct discrimination based on sex, including less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity;
(b) there shall be no indirect discrimination based on sex.
2. This Directive shall be without prejudice to more favourable provisions concerning the protection of women as regards pregnancy and maternity.
3. Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited. A person's rejection of, or submission to, such conduct may not be used as a basis for a decision affecting that person.
4. Instruction to direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of sex shall be deemed to be discrimination within the meaning of this Directive.
5. This Directive shall not preclude differences in treatment, if the provision of the goods and services exclusively or primarily to members of one sex is justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.
Article 5
Actuarial factors
1. Member States shall ensure that in all new contracts concluded after 21 December 2007 at the latest, the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for the purposes of insurance and related financial services shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States may decide before 21 December 2007 to permit proportionate differences in individuals' premiums and benefits where the use of sex is a determining factor in the assessment of risk based on relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data. The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission and ensure that accurate data relevant to the use of sex as a determining actuarial factor are compiled, published and regularly updated. These Member States shall review their decision five years after 21 December 2007, taking into account the Commission report referred to in Article 16, and shall forward the results of this review to the Commission.
3. In any event, costs related to pregnancy and maternity shall not result in differences in individuals' premiums and benefits.
Member States may defer implementation of the measures necessary to comply with this paragraph until two years after 21 December 2007 at the latest. In that case the Member States concerned shall immediately inform the Commission.
Article 6
Positive action
With a view to ensuring full equality in practice between men and women, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to sex.
Article 7
Minimum requirements
1. Member States may introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment between men and women than those laid down in this Directive.
2. The implementation of this Directive shall in no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection against discrimination already afforded by Member States in the fields covered by this Directive.
CHAPTER II
REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT
Article 8
Defence of rights
1. Member States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures, including where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, for the enforcement of the obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them, even after the relationship in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred has ended.
2. Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure real and effective compensation or reparation, as the Member States so determine, for the loss and damage sustained by a person injured as a result of discrimination within the meaning of this Directive, in a way which is dissuasive and proportionate to the damage suffered. The fixing of a prior upper limit shall not restrict such compensation or reparation.
3. Member States shall ensure that associations, organisations or other legal entities, which have, in accordance with the criteria laid down by their national law, a legitimate interest in ensuring that the provisions of this Directive are complied with, may engage, on behalf or in support of the complainant, with his or her approval, in any judicial and/or administrative procedure provided for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive.
4. Paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be without prejudice to national rules on time limits for bringing actions relating to the principle of equal treatment.
Article 9
Burden of proof
1. Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence, which are more favourable to plaintiffs.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to criminal procedures.
4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to any proceedings brought in accordance with Article 8(3).
5. Member States need not apply paragraph 1 to proceedings in which it is for the court or other competent authority to investigate the facts of the case.
Article 10
Victimisation
Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to protect persons from any adverse treatment or adverse consequence as a reaction to a complaint or to legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment.
Article 11
Dialogue with relevant stakeholders
With a view to promoting the principle of equal treatment, Member States shall encourage dialogue with relevant stakeholders which have, in accordance with national law and practice, a legitimate interest in contributing to the fight against discrimination on grounds of sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services.
CHAPTER III
BODIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL TREATMENT
Article 12
1. Member States shall designate and make the necessary arrangements for a body or bodies for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of sex. These bodies may form part of agencies charged at national level with the defence of human rights or the safeguard of individuals' rights, or the implementation of the principle of equal treatment.
2. Member States shall ensure that the competencies of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1 include:
(a) without prejudice to the rights of victims and of associations, organisations or other legal entities referred to in Article 8(3), providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination;
(b) conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination;

(a) any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished;
(b) any contractual provisions, internal rules of undertakings, and rules governing profit-making or non-profit-making associations contrary to the principle of equal treatment are, or may be, declared null and void or are amended.

Penalties
Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are applied.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 50/2004
of 9 January 2004
amending Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas, and derogating from that Regulation
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Articles 26(3) and 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(2) mainly concerns an annual quota for butter, which is not shared out over the year. To allow imports under this quota to be spread evenly throughout the quota year, with a view to ensuring an appropriate supply of the internal market, the quota in question should be allocated in two six-month tranches, taking account of the historic development of the product concerned within the quota period.
(2) Chapter I of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 concerns quotas allocated on the basis of two six-month periods in January and July each year. In view of the accession of 10 new Member States on 1 May 2004, operators in these countries should be given the opportunity to participate in Community quotas from that date. To this end, the quantities opened in January 2004 should be limited to the quantities equivalent to the period from January to April 2004. However, this allocation should not apply to quotas for the calendar year, where those quotas are characterised by under-utilisation during the previous periods.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 includes detailed rules for applying, in the milk and milk products sector, the import arrangements provided for in the Europe Agreements between the Community and its Member States, of the one part, and certain countries of central and eastern Europe, of the other part. In order to implement the concessions provided for in Council Decision 2003/452/EC of 26 May 2003 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, acting within the framework of the European Union, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(3), certain existing quotas should be increased.
(4) In order to keep the Commission informed of changes in the composition of the cheese imported under the different quotas, under Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 operators must indicate certain contents on import declarations. Where the contents shown exceed those given in Annex XIII, the competent authorities are to notify the Commission thereof. The notifications received by the Commission since imposing this obligation demonstrate a degree of stability in the composition of the cheese imported, as regards the type and origin of the cheese. The notifications generate a heavy workload for the customs services and the Commission, and produce a substantial volume of documents, while the overruns on the base contents are negligible in most cases. Notifications should therefore be limited to cases where the contents are abnormally high, by adapting the contents in Annex XIII. Moreover, for certain categories of cheese, the advantage of obtaining notifications of overruns of the contents in Annex XIII has proved negligible, as any variation in the contents concerned remains within the intervals fixed in the description of those products in the Combined Nomenclature. Notifications for the products in question should therefore be abolished.
(5) New Zealand has sent the Commission information relating to the new issuing body. Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be updated.
(6) In view of the accession of the new Member States on 1 May 2004, the period of validity of licences used for imports originating in the new Member States should be limited to 30 April 2004. A derogation should therefore be made from Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001.
(7) The allocation of the quota for butter falling within Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 in six-month tranches affects the rhythm of issue of IMA 1 certificates by the issuing body of the third country concerned. To enable the competent authorities of these countries and interested operators to take note of this amendment before it enters into force, and in compliance with the Community's international commitments, an adequate deadline should be laid down between publication and the date on which the allocation of the above quota takes effect. Moreover, since issuing bodies in third countries have been able to issue IMA 1 certificates for 2004 since 1 November 2003, the issue of import licences for all IMA 1 certificates issued up to the day before the day on which the allocation of the quota takes effect should be authorised.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended and derogated from.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EC) No 592/2004
of 30 March 2004
amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the lists of countries and territories
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC(1), and in particular Articles 10 and 21 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 lays down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and the rules applying to checks on such movement.
(2) Under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 a list of third countries is to be drawn up before 3 July 2004. To be included on that list, a third country must demonstrate its rabies status and that it complies with certain conditions relating to notification, monitoring, veterinary services, prevention and control of rabies and regulation of vaccines.
(3) In order to avoid any unnecessary disturbance in the movements of pet animals, and to allow time for the third countries to provide additional guarantees, where necessary, it is appropriate to establish a provisional list of third countries. That list should be based on the data available through the International Office of Epizootie Diseases (OIE-World Organisation for Animal Health), the results of inspections carried out by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office in the third countries concerned and information gathered by Member States.
(4) The provisional list of third countries should include countries which are free of rabies and countries in respect of which the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements from their territories has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly. In the interests of clarity the list of countries and territories set out in that Regulation should be replaced in its entirety.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 3 July 2004.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1891/2004
of 21 October 2004
laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 of 22 July 2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 introduced common rules with a view to prohibiting the entry, release for free circulation, exit, export, re-export or entry for a suspensive procedure of counterfeit and pirated goods, and to dealing effectively with the illegal marketing of such goods without impeding the freedom of legitimate trade.
(2) Since Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 replaced Council Regulation (EC) No 3295/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down measures concerning the entry into the Community and the export and re-export from the Community of goods infringing certain intellectual property rights [2], it is also necessary to replace Commission Regulation (EC) No 1367/95 [3], which laid down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 3295/94.
(3) For the different types of intellectual property rights, it is necessary to define the natural and legal persons who may represent the holder of a right or any other person authorised to use the right.
(4) It is necessary to specify the nature of the proof of ownership of intellectual property required under the second subparagraph of Article 5(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003.
(5) In order to harmonise and standardise the content and format of applications for action under Article 5(1) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 and the information to be entered on the application form, a standardised version of the form should be established. The language requirements for applications for action under Article 5(4) of the Regulation should also be laid down.
(6) The type of information to be included in applications for action should be specified in order to enable the customs authorities to recognise more readily goods that may infringe an intellectual property right.
(7) It is necessary to define the type of right-holder liability declaration which must accompany the application for action.
(8) In the interests of legal certainty, it is necessary to specify when the time periods laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 commence.
(9) Procedures should be laid down for the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, so that it is possible, on the one hand, for the Commission to monitor the effective application of the procedure laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003, to draw up in due course the report referred to in Article 23 thereof and to try to quantify and describe patterns of fraud, and, on the other hand, for the Member States to introduce appropriate risk analysis.
(10) This Regulation should apply from the same date as Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Council opinion
of 8 March 2005
on the updated convergence programme of Slovenia, 2004-2007
(2005/C 177/06)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies [1], and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation of the Commission,
After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
HAS DELIVERED THIS OPINION:
(1) On 8 March 2005 the Council examined the updated convergence programme of Slovenia, which covers the period 2004 to 2007. The programme partly complies with the data requirements of the "code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes". Government accounts do not fully abide by ESA95 standards evidenced in the high share of "other" revenue and expenditure as percentage of GDP. Therefore, Slovenia is invited to achieve full compliance with the data requirements.
(2) On the basis of currently available information, the macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme seems to reflect plausible growth assumptions. It envisages real GDP growth, estimated at 4,0 % in 2004, to continue growing at around that level throughout the rest of the programme period. The projections for inflation appear attainable but risks remain.
(3) The budgetary strategy underlying the programme aims at achieving sound public finances as defined by a budgetary position of close-to-balance, but not during the programme period. The programme envisages a gradual reduction of the general government deficit over the period covered, consistent with a sustained cut in the expenditure share as percentage of GDP. The revenue ratio, after falling steadily until 2006, rebounds towards the end of the programme period in view of the net positive budgetary impact of EU membership. According to the adjustment path, the deficit halves over the next four years, reaching just above 1 % in 2007. Compared with the previous programme, the current update broadly confirms the planned adjustment against a slightly more favourable macroeconomic scenario.
(4) The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced. On the one hand, a plausible macroeconomic scenario supports the deficit targets. Furthermore, it is at the government's discretion to refuse claims for further expenditure to safeguard the deficit target should it be threatened by unfavourable conditions, in the manner exercised in 2004. In addition, the yearly loss of VAT revenue at 0,3 % of GDP budgeted for 2005-2007 may be overestimated, rendering the tax revenue projections overly cautious. On the other hand, the level of direct tax revenues after the adopted tax reform could be uncertain. At the same time, the outcome for 2007 is partly due to the new EU financial perspective 2007-2013, anticipating a significant rise in the net budgetary inflows from the EU budget. Moreover, there is a risk of expenditure overruns, particularly regarding pension outlays should the review of the current pension indexation formula, announced for 2006, lead to a loosening of the parameters.
(5) In view of this risk assessment, the budgetary stance in the programme may not provide a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations except for the final year of the programme. It is also insufficient to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact's medium-term objective of a budgetary position of close-to-balance is achieved by 2007.
(6) Gross government debt is relatively low: the debt ratio is estimated to have reached 30,2 % of GDP in 2004, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value, and to attain 29,7 % by 2007.
(7) Slovenia appears to be at some risk with regard to the long-term sustainability of the public finances, of which the projected budgetary cost of an ageing population is an important element. The ongoing pension reform has had a positive budgetary impact but the projected increase in pension expenditure beyond 2020 remains very high. In addition, despite the introduction of some rationalisation measures of the health-care system in 2004, a further, substantial reform of the health-care system would contribute to the improvement of the long-term sustainability of the public finances.
In view of the above assessment, the Council is of the opinion that Slovenia should:
(i) seize all opportunities to accelerate the reduction of the general government deficit;
(ii) undertake further measures to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances, including the reforms of the pension and health-care systems.

Commission Decision
of 14 March 2005
amending Decision 2003/526/EC as regards classical swine fever control measures in Germany, France, Luxemburg and Slovakia
(notified under document number C(2005) 600)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/225/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In response to outbreaks of classical swine fever in certain Member States, Commission Decision 2003/526/EC of 18 July 2003 concerning protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg [2] was adopted. That Decision establishes certain additional disease control measures concerning classical swine fever.
(2) The classical swine fever situation in certain areas of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany, in the department of Moselle in France and in Luxembourg has significantly improved. This is also the case in the territories of the District Veterinary and Food Administrations of Levice, Nitra, Topoľčany, Nové Mesto nad Váhom and the district Púchov in Slovakia. Therefore, the measures adopted by Decision 2003/526/EC in relation with these areas should no longer apply.
(3) In the light of the overall disease situation of classical swine fever in other areas of Germany, France and Slovakia, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2003/526/EC.
(4) Decision 2003/526/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Decision 2003/526/EC is amended as follows:
1. In Article 11, " 30 April 2005" is replaced by " 30 April 2006".
2. The Annex is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Commission Decision
of 14 March 2005
amending Decision 2005/59/EC as regards areas where the plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the emergency vaccination of feral pigs against classical swine fever are to be implemented in Slovakia
(notified under document number C(2005) 601)
(Only the Slovak text is authentic)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/226/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever [1], and in particular Article 16(1) and Article 20(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission adopted Decision 2005/59/EC of 26 January 2005 approving the plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the emergency vaccination of such pigs in Slovakia [2], as one of a number of measures to combat classical swine fever.
(2) The Slovak authorities have informed the Commission about the recent evolution of the disease in feral pigs. This information indicates that classical swine fever in feral pigs has been successfully eradicated in the territories of the District Veterinary and Food Administrations of Levice, Nitra, Topoľčany, Nové Mesto nad Váhom and the district Púchov and that the approved eradication plan no longer needs be applied in these areas. In the light of the epidemiological information, the vaccination plan should be extended with the introduction of the vaccination of feral pigs against classical swine fever in the districts of Ilava, Žiar nad Hronom, Žarnovica and Banská Štiavnica.
(3) Decision 2005/59/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The Annex to Decision 2005/59/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Slovak Republic.
Commission Decision
of 29 April 2005
providing for a derogation from certain provisions of Council Directive 2000/29/EC as regards oak (Quercus L.) logs with bark attached, originating in the United States of America
(notified under document number C(2005) 1298)
(2005/359/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community [1], and in particular Article 15(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, oak (Quercus L.) logs with bark attached, originating in the United States of America, may, in principle, not be introduced into the Community because of the risk of introducing Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt, the cause of oak wilt.
(2) Experience has shown that in respect of the United States of America, the risk of spreading Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt can be eliminated by applying certain measures.
(3) One of these measures is fumigation. Certain Member States have requested that import of fumigated oak logs takes place only through specified ports where the appropriate handling and inspection facilities are available.
(4) It is also possible to dispense with fumigation, as regards oak wood belonging to the white oak group, under certain technical conditions. Certain Member States have requested a further derogation to allow importations of white oak during certain months of the year. This second derogation should be limited to those parts of the Community where potential vectors of Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt have little or no activity during the winter, i.e. to areas north of 45o latitude.
(5) The Commission will ensure that the United States of America makes available all technical information necessary to monitor the functioning of the protective measures required.
(6) The Member States should therefore be granted a derogation, for a limited period of time, for the introduction of oak (Quercus L.) logs with bark from the United States of America.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine [3] provides that Member States are to authorise the import of birds from third countries listed as members of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and that those birds are to be subjected to quarantine and testing upon entry into the Community.
(2) The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) has confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza on its territory. North Korea is a member of the OIE and accordingly Member States are to accept imports of such birds from that country under Decision 2000/666/EC. Taking into account the potential serious consequences related to the specific avian influenza virus strain involved in the rest of Asia, the importation of those birds from North Korea should be suspended as a precautionary measure.
(3) Under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [4], the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers originating in North Korea is authorised. In view of the current disease situation in North Korea those imports should be suspended.
(4) Commission Decision 2004/122/EC of 6 February 2004 concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in several Asian countries [5] was adopted in response to outbreaks of avian influenza in several Asian countries. Article 4 of that Decision provides that Member States are to suspend the importation from certain third countries of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers and live birds other than poultry, as defined in Decision 2000/666/EC. In the interests of animal and public health, North Korea should be added to the third countries referred to in Article 4 of Decision 2004/122/EC.
(5) Decision 2004/122/EC should be amended accordingly.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Article 4(1) of Decision 2004/122/EC is replaced by the following text:
"1. Member States shall suspend the importation from Cambodia, China including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, North Korea, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam of:
- unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers, and
- "live birds other than poultry" as defined in Decision 2000/666/EC, including birds accompanying their owners (pet birds)."
Article 2
The Member States shall amend the measures they apply to imports so as to bring them into compliance with this Decision and they shall give immediate appropriate publicity to the measures adopted. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.
Article 3
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Commission Decision
of 9 June 2005
amending Decision 2005/393/EC as regards exemptions from the exit ban for domestic movements of animals from the restricted zones
(notified under document number C(2005) 1689)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/434/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue [1], and in particular point (c) of Article 9(1), and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals leaving those zones.
(2) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC [2] provides for the demarcation of the global geographical areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue. It also sets out the conditions for exempting certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban).
(3) When a vaccination programme has been conducted in a herd, the virus circulation has been reduced to such a level that movements of young animals from the restricted zone to holdings outside the zone where vectors are under control should be considered as representing an acceptable risk.
(4) On 14 March 2005, a Commission working group on the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the Office international des épizooties (OIE) issued a report on different aspects of the rules which should apply to movements of animals as regard bluetongue.
(5) That working group concluded that viremia exceeding 60 days should not be considered as representing a significant risk for movements of live animals and as a consequence animals protected from vectors attack for more than 60 days should be considered as safe.
(6) In addition, the working group concluded that as 28 days is the maximum period for a seroconversion after infection, an animal is safe when it has been protected from vectors attack for a period exceeding 28 days and it has tested negatively serologicaly on one occasion only after that period of 28 days.
(7) The working group also concluded that as a virological test is always positive seven days after the infection, an animal is safe when it has been protected from vectors attack for more than seven days and it has tested negatively virologicaly on one occasion after that period of seven days.
(8) Decision 2005/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Amendments to Decision 2005/393/EC
Decision 2005/393/EC is amended as follows:
1. in Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
"2. Domestic movements as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be exempted from the exit ban by the competent authority if:
(a) the animals originate from a herd vaccinated according to a vaccination programme adopted by the competent authority; and
(b) the animals:
(i) have been vaccinated more than 30 days but less than twelve months before the date of movement against the serotype(s) present or possibly present in an epidemiologically relevant area of origin; or
(ii) are less than two months old at the date of movement and are destined for a holding for fattening, such holding must be protected against vector attacks and registered by the competent authority for the purpose of fattening."
2. In Annex II, Part A is replaced by the following:
"A. Live animals must have been protected from attack from Culicids:
1. for at least 60 days prior to the date of movement; or
2. for at least 28 days prior to the date of movement, and were subjected during that period to a serological test to detect antibody to the BTV group, such as the BT competition ELISA or the BT AGID test, with negative results and that test was carried out on samples taken at least 28 days after the date of the start of the period of protection from vectors attack; or
3. for at least seven days prior to the date of movement, and subjected during that period to a BTV isolation test or polymerase chain reaction test, with negative results and that test was carried out on blood samples taken at least seven days after the date of the start of the period of protection from vector attack; and
4. during transportation to the place of shipment."
Article 2
Applicability
This Decision shall apply from 4 July 2005.

Commission Decision
of 16 September 2005
amending the Appendix to Annex XIV to the 2003 Act of Accession as regards certain establishments in the meat sector in Slovakia
(notified under document number C(2005) 3451)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/661/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia [1], and in particular Annex XIV, Chapter 5, Section B, paragraph (d) thereto,
Whereas:
(1) Annex XIV, Chapter 5, Section B, paragraph (a) to the 2003 Act of Accession provides that the structural requirements laid down in Annex I to Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat [2] and in Annexes A and B to Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products [3] are not to apply to establishments in Slovakia listed in the Appendix [4] to Annex XIV to the Act of Accession until 31 December 2006, subject to certain conditions.
(2) The Appendix to Annex XIV to the 2003 Act of Accession has been amended by Commission Decision 2004/463/EC [5] and 2005/189/EC [6].
(3) According to an official declaration from the Slovak competent authority three meat establishments have completed their upgrading process and are now in full compliance with Community legislation. These establishments should therefore be deleted from the list of establishments in transition.
(4) One meat establishment on the list of establishments in transition has made considerable efforts to comply with structural requirements laid down by Community legislation. However, this establishment is not in position to finish its upgrading process by the prescribed deadline due to exceptional technical constraints. Therefore it is justified to allow it further time to complete the upgrading process.
(5) The Appendix to Annex XIV to the 2003 Act of Accession should therefore be amended accordingly. For the sake of clarity, it should be replaced.
(6) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has been informed of the measures provided for in this Decision,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The Appendix to Annex XIV to the 2003 Act of Accession is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.

Commission Decision
of 20 October 2005
amending Decision 2005/693/EC concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in Russia
(notified under document number C(2005) 4176)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/740/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18 (1) and (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22 (1) and (5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) Commission Decision 2005/693/EC of 6 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in Russia [3] was adopted following outbreaks of avian influenza in Russia. That Decision suspends the importation of birds, other than poultry, from Russia.
(3) In addition, Decision 2005/693/EC suspends the importation of unprocessed feathers and unprocessed parts of feathers from those regions of Russian listed in Annex I to that Decision. However, the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers, are still authorised from those regions of Russia not listed in Annex I to that Decision, subject to certain conditions, including those regions located west of the Ural mountains, in which outbreaks had not occurred at the date of adoption of Decision 2005/693/EC.
(4) On 19 October 2005, Russia informed the Commission that an outbreak of avian influenza has occurred in Tula, in the Central Federal District of Russia, in which no outbreaks had been previously reported and from which unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers may still be imported, in accordance with Decision 2005/693/EC.
(5) In relation to the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 in Turkey, Romania and Russia, circumstantial evidence and molecular epidemiology data strongly suggest that the avian influenza virus has spread into those third countries proceeding from central Asia via migratory birds. This is also suggested by the report of a recent mission to Russia carried out by the World Organization for Animal Health (O.I.E.), that was published on 14 October 2005.
(6) The importation into the Community of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers should therefore be banned from those regions of Russia where the outbreak of avian influenza has recently occurred or which are at particular risk, in accordance with current knowledge on the flyways of migratory brids proceeding from the areas in central Asia and Siberia where the disease has been recorded.
(7) Annex I to Commission Decision 2005/693/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
In Annex I of Decision 2005/693/EC the following points 4, 5, 6 and 7 are added:
"4. Central Federal District
Includes the following Subjects of the Russian Federation: Belgorod Oblast, Bryansk Oblast, Ivanovo Oblast, Kaluga Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Kursk Oblast, Lipetsk Oblast, Moscow (federal city), Moscow Oblast, Oryol Oblast, Ryazan Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, Tambo
Commission Decision
of 19 October 2005
allowing Member States to extend provisional authorisations granted for the new active substances boscalid, indoxacarb, spinosad and Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus
(notified under document number C(2005) 4002)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2005/743/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [1], and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in April 2001 Germany received an application from BASF AG for the inclusion of the active substance boscalid (former name: nicobifen) in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2002/268/EC [2] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(2) In October 1997 the Netherlands received an application from DuPont de Nemours concerning indoxacarb (former name: DPX-KN128). Commission Decision 98/398/EC [3] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(3) In July 1999 the Netherlands received an application from Dow Agrosciences concerning spinosad. Commission Decision 2000/210/EC [4] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(4) In July 1996 the Netherlands received an application from Biosys concerning Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Commission Decision 97/865/EC [5] confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(5) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.
(6) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the respective applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 22 November 2002 (boscalid), 7 February 2000 (indoxacarb), 5 March 2001 (spinosad) and 19 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus).
(7) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the Rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessments. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed within 24 months.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Member States may extend provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing boscalid, indoxacarb, spinosad or Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of adoption of this Decision.
Article 2
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Commission Decision
of 8 December 2005
granting a derogation requested by the Netherlands pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources
(notified under document number C(2005) 4778)
(Only the Dutch text is authentic)
(2005/880/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources [1], and in particular subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) If the amount of manure that a Member state intends to apply per hectare each year is different from the one specified in introductory sentences of paragraph 2 and subparagraph (a) of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC, that amount has to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as, in the present case, long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(2) On 8 April 2005, the Netherlands submitted to the Commission a request for a derogation under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC.
(3) The requested derogation concerns the intention of the Netherlands to allow the application of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland. Approximately 25000 farms in the Netherlands and approximately 900000 hectares are concerned by that request for derogation.
(4) The Dutch legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.
(5) The Dutch legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC includes application standards both for nitrogen and phosphate. Application standards related to phosphate are aimed to achieve an equilibrium in phosphate fertilisation by 2015.
(6) The Netherlands addressed the issue of nutrient surplus from manure and mineral fertilisers through several policy instruments and in the period 1992 to 2002 decreased cattle numbers by 17 %, pigs by 14 % and sheep and goats by 21 %. Nitrogen and phosphorus in manure decreased respectively by 29 and 34 % in the period 1985 to 2002. Nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses decreased respectively by 25 and 37 %, in the period 1992 to 2002.
(7) Water quality data show a downwards trend in groundwater nitrate concentration and in nutrient concentration (including phosphorus) in surface water.
(8) The technical and scientific documents presented in the Dutch notification show that the proposed amount of 250 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from cattle manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland is compatible with the achievement of the level of 11,3 mg/l N (corresponding to 50 mg/l NO3) in water in all soil types, and to approximately a zero phosphorus surplus, under conditions of optimal management.
(9) The technical and scientific documents presented show that the proposed amount of 250 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from cattle manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing season and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(10) The Commission considers therefore that the amount of manure requested by the Netherlands will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.
(11) These conditions include the establishment of fertiliser plans on a farm by farm basis, the recording of fertiliser practices through fertiliser accounts, periodic soil analysis, green cover in winter after maize, specific provisions on grass ploughing, no manure application before grass ploughing and adjustment of fertilisation to take into account the contribution of leguminous crops. These provisions are aimed at ensuring fertilisation based on crop needs and reduction and prevention of nitrogen losses to water.
(12) In order to avoid that the application of the requested derogation leads to intensification, the competent authorities should ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus does not increase beyond the level of the year 2002 in accordance with the action programme to be implemented by the Netherlands.
(13) Accordingly the requested derogation should be approved.
(14) This Decision should be applicable in connection with the action programme of the Netherlands for 2006 to 2009.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The derogation requested by the Netherlands by letter of 8 April 2005, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the introductory sentences and subparagraph (a) of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.

(a) on sand and loess soil, grass or other crops ensuring soil coverage during the winter shall be cultivated after maize in order to substantially reduce leaching potential;
(b) catch crops shall not be ploughed before 1 February in order to ensure permanent vegetal cover of arable area for recovering subsoil autumn losses of nitrates and limit winter losses;
(c) grass on sandy and loessial soils shall be ploughed in spring;
(d) ploughed grass on all soil types shall be followed immediately by a crop with high nitrogen demand and fertilisation shall be based on soil analysis concerning mineral nitrogen and other parameters providing references for estimate of nitrogen release from soil organic matter mineralisation;
(e) if crop rotation includes leguminous or other plants fixing atmospheric nitrogen fertiliser application shall be reduced accordingly.
2. By way of derogation from point (c) grass ploughing is permitted in autumn for planting flowers bulbs.
Article 7
Measures on manure production
The national authorities shall ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus will not increase beyond the level of the year 2002.
Article 8
Monitoring
1. Maps showing the percentage of grassland farms, percentage of livestock and percentage of agricultural land covered by individual derogation in each municipality, shall be drawn by the competent authority and shall be updated every year.
Those maps shall be submitted to the Commission annually and for the first time in the second quarter of 2006.
2. A monitoring network for sampling of soil water, streams and shallow groundwater shall be established and maintained as derogation monitoring sites.
The monitoring network, corresponding to at least 300 farms benefiting from individual derogations, shall be representative of each soil type (clay, peat, sandy and sandy loessial soils), fertilisation practices and crop rotation. The composition of the monitoring network shall not be modified during the period of applicability of this Decision.
3. Survey and continuous nutrient analysis shall provide data on local land use, crop rotations and agricultural practices on farms benefiting from individual derogations. Those data can be used for model-based calculations of the magnitude of nitrate leaching and phosphorus losses from fields where up to 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year in manure from grazing livestock is applied.
4. Shallow groundwater, soil water, drainage water and streams in farms belonging to the monitoring network shall provide data on nitrate and phosphorus concentration in water leaving the root zone and entering the groundwater and surface water system.
5. A reinforced water monitoring shall address agricultural catchments in sandy soils.
Article 9
Controls
1. The competent national authority shall carry out administrative controls in respect of all farms benefiting from an individual derogation for the assessment of compliance with the maximum amount of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from grazing livestock manure, with total nitrogen and phosphate application standards and conditions on land use.
2. A programme of inspections shall be established based on risk analysis, results of controls of the previous years and results of general random controls of legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC.
Specific inspections shall address at least 5 % of farms benefiting from an individual derogation with regard to land use, livestock number and manure production.
Field inspections shall be carried out in at least 3 % of farms in respect to the conditions set out in Article 5 and 6.

amending, for the purposes of their adaptation to technical progress, Directives 97/24/EC and 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 26 October 2005
on enhancing port security
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1],
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2],
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3],
Whereas:
(1) Security incidents resulting from terrorism are among the greatest threats to the ideals of democracy, freedom and peace, which are the very essence of the European Union.
(2) People, infrastructure and equipment in ports should be protected against security incidents and their devastating effects. Such protection would benefit transport users, the economy and society as a whole.
(3) On 31 March 2004 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 [4] on enhancing ship and port facility security. The maritime security measures imposed by that Regulation constitute only part of the measures necessary to achieve an adequate level of security throughout maritime-linked transport chains. That Regulation is limited in scope to security measures on board vessels and the immediate ship/port interface.
(4) In order to achieve the fullest protection possible for maritime and port industries, port security measures should be introduced, covering each port within the boundaries defined by the Member State concerned, and thereby ensuring that security measures taken pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 benefit from enhanced security in the areas of port activity. These measures should apply to all those ports in which one or more port facilities covered by Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 are situated.
(5) The security objective of this Directive should be achieved by adopting appropriate measures without prejudice to the rules of the Member States in the field of national security and measures which might be taken on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
(6) Member States should rely upon detailed security assessments to identify the exact boundaries of the security-relevant port area, as well as the different measures required to ensure appropriate port security. Such measures should differ according to the security level in place and reflect differences in the risk profile of different sub-areas in the port.
(7) Member States should approve port security plans which incorporate the findings of the port security assessment. The effectiveness of security measures also requires the clear division of tasks between all parties involved as well as regular exercises. This clear division of tasks and the recording of exercise procedures in the format of the port security plan is considered to contribute strongly to the effectiveness of both preventive and remedial port security measures.
(8) Roll-on roll-off vessels are particularly vulnerable to security incidents, in particular if they carry passengers as well as cargo. Adequate measures should be taken on the basis of risk assessments which ensure that cars and goods vehicles destined for transport on roll-on roll-off vessels on domestic and international routes do not cause a risk to the vessel, its passengers and crew or to the cargo. The measures should be taken in a way which impedes as little as possible the fluidity of the operations.
(9) Member States should be able to establish port security committees entrusted with providing practical advice in the ports covered by this Directive.
(10) Member States should ensure that responsibilities in port security are clearly recognised by all parties involved. Member States should monitor compliance with security rules and clearly establish a responsible authority for all their ports, approve all security assessments and plans for their ports, set and communicate as appropriate security levels and ensure that measures are well communicated, implemented and coordinated.
(11) Member States should approve assessments and plans and monitor their implementation in their ports. In order to keep disruption to ports and the administrative burden on inspection bodies to a minimum, the Commission's monitoring of the implementation of this Directive should be conducted jointly with the inspections provided for in Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004.
(12) Member States should ensure that a focal point for port security takes up the role of contact point between the Commission and Member States. They should inform the Commission which ports are covered by this Directive on the basis of the security assessments carried out.
(13) The effective and standard implementation of measures under this security policy raises important questions in relation to its funding. The funding of extra security measures should not generate distortions of competition. By 30 June 2006, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and the Council the findings of a study on the costs involved in measures taken under this Directive, addressing in particular the way financing is shared between the public authorities, port authorities and operators.
(14) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [5].
(16) A procedure should be defined for the adaptation of this Directive to take account of developments in international instruments and, in the light of experience, to adapt or complement the detailed provisions of the Annexes to this Directive, without broadening the scope of this Directive.
(17) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the balanced introduction of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport and port policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the European scale of this Directive, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(18) Since this Directive concerns seaports, the obligations herein contained should not be applicable to Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg or Slovakia,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Directive 2005/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 14 December 2005
repealing Council Directive 90/544/EEC on the frequency bands designated for the coordinated introduction of pan-European land-based public radio paging in the Community
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1],
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2],
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3],
Whereas:
(1) Directive 90/544/EEC [4] required Member States to designate, by 31 December 1992, in the 169,4 to 169,8 MHz radio spectrum band four channels for the pan-European land-based public radio paging service (hereinafter ERMES) and to prepare, as quickly as possible, plans to enable pan-European public radio paging service to occupy the whole band 169,4 to 169,8 MHz according to commercial demand.
(2) Use of the 169,4 to 169,8 MHz spectrum band for ERMES in the Community has decreased or even ceased, so that this band is not currently being efficiently utilised by ERMES and could be better used to fulfil other Community policy needs.
(3) Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) [5] established a Community policy and legal framework to ensure coordination of policy approaches and, where appropriate, harmonised conditions with regard to availability and efficient use of the spectrum band necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market. That Decision allows the Commission to adopt technical implementing measures to ensure harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of the spectrum band.
(4) Since the 169,4 to 169,8 MHz band is appropriate for applications benefiting people with impairments or disabilities, and considering that promotion of such applications is a policy objective for the Community together with the general objective of ensuring the functioning of the internal market, the Commission pursuant to Article 4(2) of the Radio Spectrum Decision issued the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administration (hereinafter the CEPT) with a mandate to examine, inter alia, applications related to assistance for people with disabilities.
(5) As mandated, the CEPT produced a new frequency plan, and a channel arrangement allowing six types of preferred applications to share the band in order to meet several Community policy needs.
(6) For these reasons and in accordance with the objectives of the Radio Spectrum Decision, Directive 90/544/EEC should be repealed,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 90/544/EEC is hereby repealed with effect from 27 December 2005.
Article 2
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 3
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1962/2005
of 30 November 2005
derogating from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as regards the determination of the refund rate for milk and milk products in the case of supplies as referred to in Articles 36 and 44 of that Regulation and carried out from 1 to 16 June 2005
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 31(14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As from 17 June 2005, Commission Regulation (EC) No 909/2005 of 16 June 2005 fixing the export refunds for milk and milk products [2] no longer provides for export refunds on supplies as referred to in Articles 36 and 44 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products [3].
(2) In accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, Member States may authorise exporters to follow a procedure whereby the last day of the month is used to determine the rate of refund applicable to supplies as referred to in Articles 36 and 44 of that Regulation loaded each month. It is therefore not possible to determine the rate of refund applicable to supplies of milk and milk products carried out under that procedure from 1 to 16 June 2005.
(3) Entitlement to the refund on supplies carried out under the procedure provided for in Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, before the date of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 909/2005, should not be affected.

Commission Regulation (EC) Νo 2134/2005
of 22 December 2005
fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice [2], and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 [3] on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on 23 December 2005.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2183/2005
of 22 December 2005
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 [1], and in particular Article 145(c), (h), (i), and (s) and Article 155 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 [2] introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 [3] defines the rules for the coupled support for cotton, olive oil, raw tobacco and hops as well as the de-coupled support and the integration of those sectors into the single payment scheme.
(3) For the purposes of the establishment of the amount and the determination of payment entitlements in the framework of the integration of tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops payments in the single payment scheme, specific rules should be established concerning the national ceilings referred to in Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and different aspects of the national reserve referred to in Article 42 (1) and (8) of that Regulation.
(4) In Member States that applied the single payment scheme in 2005, for farmers who were allocated, bought or received payment entitlements by the last date for applying for the establishment of payment entitlements for 2006, the value and number of their payment entitlements should be recalculated as a result of the reference amounts and hectares derived from the integration of tobacco, olive oil and cotton payments. Set-aside payment entitlements should not be taken into account in this calculation.
(5) It should be allowed that the private contractual clause referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 be inserted or modified in a lease contract until the last date for lodging an application under the single payment scheme in 2006.
(6) For Member States that apply the regional model established in Article 59(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, all payment entitlements should be increased by a supplementary amount as a result of the reference amounts derived from the integration of tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops payments.
(7) In application of Article 71(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Malta and Slovenia have decided to apply the single payment scheme in 2007. The third subparagraph of Article 71(1) of that Regulation provides that the transitional period shall not apply in respect of cotton, olive oil and table olives and tobacco and shall apply only until 31 December 2005 in respect of hops. Malta and Slovenia would therefore be obliged to implement the single payment scheme only for those sectors and integrate all the other sectors in 2007. In order to facilitate the transition towards the single payment scheme, it is therefore appropriate to provide for transitional rules allowing them to continue the application, in 2006, of the current regimes for olive groves in Malta and Slovenia and for hops in Slovenia, which are the only sectors concerned in those Member States. Malta and Slovenia could therefore proceed to the implementation of the single payment scheme, in 2007, for all the sectors.
(8) Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 provides that for the olive oil sector, the reference amount corresponding to the individual farmers is the four-year average of the total amount of payments which a farmer was granted under the olive oil production aid, calculated and adjusted according to Annex VII to that Regulation, during the marketing years 1999/2000, 2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03. At the time of adopting Regulation (EC) No 864/2004, the Commission had not fixed the definitive amount of aid for the marketing year 2002/03. It is appropriate to amend point H of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 in order to take into account the unit amount of the production aid for olives for the marketing year 2002/03 fixed in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1299/2004 [4].
(9) Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides that the total number of payment entitlements is equal to the average number of hectares for which direct payments have been granted during the reference period. As regards the olive oil sector, the number of hectares is to be calculated on the basis of the common method referred to in point H of Annex VII to that Regulation. It is necessary to define the common method to determine the number of hectares as well as the payment entitlements and the utilisation of the payment entitlements in the olive oil sector.
(10) Articles 44 and 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 consider as eligible to the single payment scheme areas planted with olive trees after 1 May 1998 within approved planting schemes. Those plantings may be considered as investments in the framework of Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004. The final date for the authorised plantings under those schemes has been fixed at 31 December 2006. It is necessary to fix a later date for the investments concerning olive-tree plantings.
(11) Regulations (EC) No 1782/2003 and (EC) No 795/2004 should be amended accordingly.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

1. The number of hectares to be taken into account for the determination of the number of payment entitlements referred to in Article 43 and Annex VII, point H, of Regulation (CE) No 1782/2003 is calculated by the Member States in olive GIS -ha according to the common method defined in annex XXIV of the Regulation (CE) No 1973/2004.
2. With regards to the parcels occupied partially by olive trees and partially by other crops covered by the single payment scheme, including set-aside areas, the calculation method to be used to determine the surface occupied by olive trees shall be the method referred to in paragraph 1. The surface of the part of the area planted with other crops covered by the single payment scheme is determined in accordance with the integrated system provided for in Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (CE) No 1782/2003.
The application of these two methods of calculation shall not result in a surface higher than the agricultural surface of the parcel.
3. By way of derogation to paragraph 1, the common method defined in Annex XXIV shall not be applicable in cases where:
(a) The olive-grove parcel is of a minimum size, to be determined by the Member State within the limits of a size of 0,1 hectare.
(b) The olive-grove parcel is situated in an administrative entity for which the Member State has established an alternative system of olive-grove GIS.

Council opinion
of 24 January 2006
on the updated convergence programme of the Czech Republic, 2005-2008
(2006/C 55/02)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies [1], and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation of the Commission,
After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
HAS DELIVERED THIS OPINION:
(1) On 24 January 2006 the Council examined the updated convergence programme of the Czech Republic, which covers the period 2005 to 2008.
(2) After achieving progress in economic reforms and in stabilisation by mid-1990s, the Czech Republic experienced macroeconomic imbalances, leading to a foreign-exchange crisis in May 1997 and to an economic recession in 1997-1999. Comprehensive structural reforms in the financial and enterprise sectors helped the economy to recover from 2000. Since then real annual GDP growth averaged about 3 %, compared to an average annual growth rate of 1,7 % in the EU. The programme contains three different scenarios for the macroeconomic and budgetary projections: an "optimistic" scenario, a "baseline" and a "pessimistic" scenario. The "baseline" scenario is considered as the reference scenario for assessing budgetary projections because, assessed against currently available information, it appears to be based on plausible growth assumptions, tilted to favourable in the outer year. It envisages that real GDP growth will slightly decrease from 4,8 % in 2005 to 4,3 % on average over the rest of the programme period. The cyclical component of growth is likely to be higher than implied by the programme's projections. The programme's projections for inflation appear to be on the low side.
(3) On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that the Czech Republic was in excessive deficit. According to the Council recommendation under Article 104(7) of 5 July 2004, the excessive deficit has to be corrected by 2008. In its opinion of 18 January 2005 on the previous update of the Czech Republic's convergence programme covering the period 2004-2007, the Council recommended to the Czech Republic "to allocate higher-than-budgeted revenues to deficit reduction and adhere strictly to the medium-term expenditure ceilings for central government, which become legally binding from 2006". Furthermore, the Czech Republic was invited "to step up the pension reform and to undertake the reform of the healthcare system to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances".
(4) The programme broadly follows the model structure and data provision requirements for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2].
(5) The general government deficit for 2005 is estimated at 3,2 % of GDP, based on the Commission services' autumn 2005 forecasts, against a targeted deficit of 4,7 % of GDP in the previous update and compared to a very cautious estimate of 4,8 % of GDP in the current update. The Commission services' estimate of the deficit outcome reflects more recent information on the budgetary performance of the central government, in particular of the state budget, which recorded higher-than-planned tax revenues and an under-execution of expenditures of about 1,5 % of GDP.
(6) This update aims at reducing the general government deficit to below the 3 % of GDP reference value in 2008, in line with the Council recommendation under Article 104(7). In particular, it projects the deficit to be cut by over 2 percentage points of GDP between 2005 and 2008 and the primary deficit by 2,3 percentage points. However, excluding the impact of two one-off expenditures in 2005, the improvement in the nominal deficit over the period is only 1 percentage point of GDP. The deficit reduction mainly reflects a cut in the expenditure ratio (by 2,3 percentage points of GDP) over the programme period, while revenues are broadly unchanged (-0.2 percentage point). Public consumption and social transfers are the expenditure items that are planned to decline most as a percent of GDP. Public investment is foreseen to rise strongly, from 5 % of GDP in 2004 to over 6 % of GDP in 2008, well above the EU average (2,5 % of GDP in 2005). Compared with the previous programme, the November 2005 update broadly confirms the planned adjustment, although the underlying macroeconomic scenario is considerably stronger.
(7) Over the programme period, the structural balance (i.e. the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) calculated according to the commonly agreed methodology is planned to improve by 12 % of GDP. The programme sets the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position at a structural deficit of "around" 1 % of GDP, which it does not aim to achieve within the programme period. As the programme's MTO is more demanding than the minimum benchmark (estimated at a deficit of around 1,5 % of GDP), its eventual achievement should fulfil the aim of providing a safety margin against the occurrence of an excessive deficit. The programme's MTO is at an appropriate level under the current assessment because it adequately reflects the debt ratio and average potential output growth in the long term.
(8) The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced. On the one hand, the track record of cautious budgetary planning indicates that outcomes could be better than targeted (as was the case in 2004 and is expected by the Commission services also for 2005). The growth assumptions underlying the budgets have usually been realistic and the assumptions about tax elasticities cautious. Moreover, budgeted expenditures have not always been fully executed, mainly due to the possibility to carry over unspent funds from previous budgetary years. On the other hand, the programme refers to several (proposed) measures in the area of social spending which would increase expenditure under this heading rather than decrease it, as projected in the programme. Moreover, expenditure carryovers of more than 1 % of GDP were accumulated in 2004 and Commission services expect their volume to further increase in 2005. If these sizeable carryovers were spent in addition to all budgeted expenditures — which cannot be excluded especially in the election year 2006 — budgetary outcomes could be worse than targeted, in particular in 2006. Furthermore, the growth assumption in the final year of the programme seems favourable.
(9) In view of this risk assessment, the budgetary stance in the programme seems consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2008 as recommended by the Council, which is the end-year of the programme. However, the envisaged adjustment path in structural terms could be strengthened, especially when the possibility of a much better outcome in 2005 and the upward revision of growth prospects are taken into account.
(10) The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 37,4 % of GDP in 2005, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value. The programme projects the debt ratio to increase by 0,5 percentage point over the programme period.
(11) With regard to the sustainability of public finances, the Czech Republic appears to be at high risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing populations. While the debt ratio is currently relatively low in an EU perspective, the high deficit contributes to a rising debt ratio in the long-term projections until 2050, which increases the risk to debt sustainability. At the same time, the projected high increases of pension expenditure over the projection period are expected to put a significant burden on the public finances. A rigorous implementation of the planned consolidation of public finances over the medium term and a further strengthening of the budgetary position together with additional structural reforms to contain the increase in age-related expenditures, in particular on pensions and health care, appear to be of key importance in order to mitigate the risks to public finance sustainability [3].
(12) The envisaged measures in the area of public finances are broadly consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines included in the integrated guidelines for the period 2005-2008. In particular, the programme foresees the correction of the excessive deficit in line with the Council's recommendations. It also presents measures to promote a growth- and employment-oriented allocation of resources, in particular by decreasing the weight of the public sector in the economy and by shifting the tax burden from direct to indirect taxation. However, while the government is aware of the problem of the long-term sustainability, the programme does not present concrete steps to address it.
(13) The National Reform Programme of the Czech Republic, submitted on 14 October 2005 in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, identifies long-term sustainability as the main challenge with implications for public finances. The budgetary implications of the limited number of concrete reform measures specified in the National Reform Programme are reflected in the budgetary projections of the convergence programme. The measures in the area of public finances envisaged in the convergence programme are in line with the actions foreseen in the National Reform Programme. In particular, the convergence programme outlines measures to support jobs and growth by changes in the revenue and expenditure structure (especially a shift of the tax burden from direct to indirect taxation and a cut in government consumption and transfers) and by making public investment a spending priority, but, as stated above, it does not present any concrete reform steps to address the problem of long-term sustainability. The programme further envisages a strengthening of the role of the medium-term expenditure ceilings by implementing the binding principles on the headings of the state budget and of the state funds and by inclusion of local governments in the budgetary planning process.
In view of the above assessment, the Council notes that the programme follows the deficit adjustment path set by the Council recommendations under Article 104(7). In the light of these recommendations, the Council is of the opinion that the Czech Republic should:
(i) strengthen, in the context of possible better budgetary outcome in 2005 as well as strong growth outcome and prospects, the effort in the structural budgetary adjustment, in view of the small margin below the reference value targeted for 2008 (which is the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit) and in order to speed up the attainment of the MTO;
(ii) enhance the quality of budgetary planning, in particular by analysing causes of significant expenditure carryovers and reinforcing the medium-term expenditure ceilings;
(iii) improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances, in particular by accelerating the pension reform and undertaking the reform of the healthcare system.

Commission Decision
of 17 February 2006
concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decisions 2006/86/EC, 2006/90/EC, 2006/91/EC, 2006/94/EC, 2006/104/EC and 2006/105/EC
(notified under document number C(2006) 554)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2006/115/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [2], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of 26 May 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [3], and in particular Article 18 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread from wild birds to domestic birds, notably poultry, and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products.
(2) Cases of highly pathological avian influenza of the subtype virus H5NI are suspected or confirmed in several Member States. The Commission has already adopted interim protection measures. Taking into account the epidemiological situation, it is appropriate to take the necessary protection measures at Community level, to prevent that disease from spreading from wild birds to poultry.
(3) Where an H5 avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case in wild birds is isolated on the territory of a Member State and where pending the determination of the neuraminidase (N) type and of the pathogenicity index the clinical picture and the epidemiological circumstances justify the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 or the presence of that subtype has been confirmed, the affected Member State should apply certain protection measures to minimise the risk for poultry.
(4) The specific measures provided for in this Decision should apply without prejudice to the measures to be taken by Member States in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza [4].
(5) In the interests of consistency, it is appropriate to apply for the purposes of this Decision certain definitions provided for in Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [5], Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs [6], Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [7], Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [8].
(6) Protection and surveillance zones should be established around the place where the disease was detected in wild birds. Those zones should be limited to what is necessary to prevent virus introduction into commercial and non-commercial poultry flocks.
(7) It is appropriate to control and restrict the movement of, in particular, live birds and hatching eggs while allowing the controlled dispatch from the zones of such birds and products of avian origin subject to certain conditions.
(8) The measures laid down in Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk [9] should be implemented in protection and surveillance zones, independently of the defined risk status of the area where highly pathogenic avian influenza is suspected or confirmed in wild birds.
(9) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC [10] provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States. A derogation from the transport restrictions should be envisaged for birds coming from and proceeding to bodies, institutes and centres approved in accordance with that Directive.
(10) Transport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. The dispatch of hatching eggs to other countries may be permitted subject in particular to compliance with the conditions referred to in Directive 2005/94/EC. In such cases the animal health certificates provided for in accordance with Directive 90/539/EEC should include a reference to this Decision.
(11) The dispatch from protection zones of meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products should be permitted subject to certain conditions, in particular as regards compliance with certain requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [11].
(12) Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [12] establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, and provides for the possibility to establish a specific health mark and the health mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [13] authorises the placing on the market of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in areas of the Community under animal health restrictions, because those products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact with susceptible animals.
(14) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the transposition of Directive 2005/94/EC by Member States.
(15) Following the notification of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 in wild avian fauna in Greece, Italy and Slovenia the Commission, in collaboration with the Member State concerned, adopted Decisions 2006/86/EC [14], 2006/90/EC [15], 2006/91/EC [16], 2006/94/EC [17], 2006/104/EC [18] and 2006/105/EC [19] concerning certain interim protection measures in relation to suspected cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the respective Member State, which should be repealed.
(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

Commission Decision
of 28 July 2006
concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in South Africa
(notified under document number C(2006) 3350)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2006/532/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(1) and (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22(1) and (5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and other birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread through international trade in live poultry and other birds or their products.
(2) On 29 June 2006, South Africa confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a ratite farm in the Western Cape Province.
(3) The avian influenza virus strain detected during that outbreak is of subtype H5N2 and therefore different from the strain currently causing the epidemic in Asia, Northern Africa and Europe. Current knowledge suggests that the risk for public health in relation to that subtype is inferior to the risk from the strain circulating in Asia, which is an H5N1 virus subtype.
(4) Under current Community legislation, South Africa is only authorised to export to the Community live ratites and their hatching eggs and fresh meat and meat preparations and products containing meat of those species.
(5) In view of the animal health risk of the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza into the Community, it is appropriate as an immediate measure to suspend imports of live ratites and hatching eggs of these species from South Africa.
(6) In addition, it is appropriate to suspend imports into the Community from South Africa of fresh meat of ratites and meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of those species. However, taking into account the fact that the disease was introduced on the affected farms in mid-June, it is appropriate to provide for a derogation for fresh meat and meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat from such species slaughtered before 1 May 2006 subject to certain conditions.
(7) South Africa has applied strict disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission which justify limiting the suspension of imports to the affected part of the territory of South Africa.
(8) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC of 3 June 2005 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC [3] lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of certain meat products and establishes treatment regimes considered effective in inactivating the pathogens of certain animal diseases. In order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products, appropriate treatment must be applied depending on the health status of the country of origin and the species the product is obtained from. It is therefore appropriate that imports of meat products and meat preparations consisting of or containing meat of ratites originating in South Africa and subjected to an appropriate treatment provided for in that Decision should continue to be authorised.
(9) As soon as South Africa has communicated further information on the disease situation concerning highly pathogenic avian influenza and the control measures taken in that respect, the measures taken at Community level in relation to the recent outbreak in South Africa should be reviewed. Accordingly, this Decision should only apply until 31 October 2006.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Member States shall suspend imports, from that part of the territory of South Africa referred to in the Annex to this Decision, of:
(a) live ratites and hatching eggs of ratites;
(b) fresh meat of ratites;
(c) meat products and meat preparations consisting of or containing meat of ratites.
Article 2
1. By way of derogation from points (b) and (c) of Article 1, Member States shall authorise the importation of fresh meat, meat products and meat preparations referred to in those points which have been obtained from birds slaughtered before 1 May 2006.
2. In the veterinary certificates accompanying consignments of the meat, meat products and meat preparations referred to in paragraph 1 the following words shall be included:
%quot%Fresh ratite meat/meat products consisting of or containing meat of ratites/meat preparations consisting of or containing meat of ratites [4] obtained from birds slaughtered before 1 May 2006 in accordance with Article 2(1) of Commission Decision 2006/532/EC.
3. By way of derogation from point (c) of Article 1, Member States shall authorise the importation of meat products and meat preparations consisting of or containing meat of ratites provided that the meat has undergone at least one of the specific treatments referred to under points B, C or D in Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2005/432/EC.

of 24 July 2006
fixing the date of application of Article 1(4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 871/2004 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, including in the fight against terrorism
(2006/628/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 871/2004 of 29 April 2004 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, including in the fight against terrorism [1], and in particular to Article 2(2) thereof,

Article 2
This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 94/2006
of 19 January 2006
fixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [1], and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector [2], provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry [3], to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 17023091 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d), (f), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the natural state, shall be set out in the Annex hereto to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on 20 January 2006.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/2006
of 30 May 2006
opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening ( 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [1], and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The WTO schedule CXL requires the Community to open an annual import tariff quota for 169000 head of young male bovine animals for fattening. However, as a result of negotiations which led to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the United States of America pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 [2], approved by Council Decision 2006/333/EC [3], the Community undertook to incorporate in its schedule for all Member States an adjustment of that import tariff quota.
(2) It is appropriate to lay down in the detailed rules for the management of this tariff quota that for the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 the available quantity should be phased over the year in a suitable manner within the meaning of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
(3) In view of the forthcoming entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, without prejudice to Article 39 of that Treaty, and in order to enable operators of those countries to benefit from this quota as of the date of their accession, the quota period should be divided into two sub-periods and the quantity available under this quota should be staggered over these periods, taking into account the traditional trade patterns between the Community and the supplier countries within this quota.
(4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads.
(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the period from 1 May 2005 to 30 April 2006 given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment.
(6) To enable such criteria to be checked, applications should be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.
(7) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2006 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable.
(8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform allocation coefficient has been applied.
(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition to or by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 [4] and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [5].
(10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security, within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products [6].
(11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should not apply.
(12) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of the imported animals. The animals should therefore be fattened in the Member State which has issued the import licence.
(13) A security should be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the Common Customs Tariff duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. A tariff quota for 24070 young male bovine animals falling within CN code 01029005, 01029029 or 01029049 and intended for fattening in the Community is hereby opened for the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007.

4. Applicants may lodge no more than one application each per period referred to in Article 1(3). Where the same applicant lodges more than one application, all applications from that applicant shall be inadmissible.
5. After verification of the documents presented, Member States shall forward to the Commission, by the 5th working day following the end of the period for the submission of applications at the latest, the list of applicants and their addresses as well as the quantities applied for.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector [1], and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 33(2) thereof,

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006
of 14 December 2006
laying down detailed rules for the certification of hops and hop products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 of 23 November 2005 concerning the common organisation of the market in hops and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1696/71, (EEC) No 1037/72, (EEC) No 879/73 and (EEC) No 1981/82 [1], and in particular Article 17 thereof,
Whereas,
(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 provides that the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation, harvested or prepared within the Community are to be subject to a certification procedure.
(2) Detailed rules for the certification of hops are laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1784/77 of 19 July 1977 concerning the certification of hops [2] and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 890/78 of 28 April 1978 laying down detailed rules for the certification of hops [3]. Since further amendments are to be made, it is appropriate, in the interest of clarity, to repeal Regulations (EEC) No 1784/77 and (EEC) No 890/78 and to replace them by a single Regulation.
(3) In order to ensure substantially uniform application of the certification procedure in the Member States, it is necessary to specify the products subject to certification, the operations involved and the information to be given on the documents which accompany the products.
(4) In view of their special nature and their use, certain products should be excluded from the certification procedure.
(5) To enable control to be exercised in respect of hop cones, a declaration signed by the producer should accompany hop cones presented for certification. This declaration should contain information which makes it possible to identify the hops from the moment they are presented for certification until the certificate is issued.
(6) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 provides for that certificates may be issued only for products having minimum quality characteristics. Provision should therefore be made to ensure that hop cones comply with minimum marketing requirements from the initial marketing stage onwards.
(7) For the purposes of determining the quality characteristics which hops must possess, the moisture content and extraneous matter content should be taken into consideration. In view of the reputation for quality that Community hops have acquired, the existing procedures customary in commercial transactions should be taken as a basis.
(8) The choice of method for checking the moisture content of hops should be left to the Member States, provided that the methods adopted give comparable results. In case of disputes, a Community method should be used.
(9) Strict rules governing blends should be laid down. Blends of hop cones should therefore be authorised only if they consist of certified products of the same variety coming from the same harvest and the same production area. It should also be specified that blending must be done under supervision and that blends must be subject to the same certification procedure as their components.
(10) In view of users' requirements, it should be permissible under certain conditions to blend certified hops which are not of the same variety and do not come from the same production area in the manufacture of powder and extracts.
(11) Hops prepared from hops certified unprepared may themselves be certified only if preparation is carried out within a closed operating circuit.
(12) To ensure compliance with the certification procedure in the case of hop products, provision should be made for surveillance in accordance with appropriate rules.
(13) The subsequent certification procedure should also be simplified for hop products where the packaging of a product is changed under official surveillance and without processing.
(14) In order to ensure that certified products can be identified, rules should be laid down to the effect that the packaging should bear the necessary entries for official surveillance purposes and for the information of buyers.
(15) In order to ensure that users have exact information on the origin and characteristics of products put on the market, common rules should be laid down for the marking of packages and the numbering of certificates.
(16) In order to take account of current commercial practice in certain Community regions, hops marketed seeded and seedless should be defined and provision made for the appropriate entry on the certificate.
(17) Experimental strains of hops in the course of development may be identified by a name or a number.
(18) Products which are excluded from the certification procedure should be subject to specific requirements, to ensure that those products cannot disturb the normal marketing pattern for certified products and that they are suitable for their declared use and are used only by those to whom they are consigned.
(19) Member States should certify products in accordance with this Regulation through authorised bodies specially designated for that purpose. The lists of those bodies should be communicated to the Commission.
(20) The Member States should define the zones or regions to be considered as hop production areas and communicate the list thereof to the Commission.
(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Hops,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies [1], and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation of the Commission,
After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS OPINION:
+++++ TABLE +++++
--------------------------------------------------
[1] OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1. The documents referred to in this text can be found at the following websitehttp://europa.eu.int/comm/economy_finance/about/activities/sgp/main_en.htm
Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the XXXIIIrd Report on Competition Policy — 2003
(SEC(2004) 658 final)
(2005/C 221/01)
On 4 June 2004, the European Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the XXXIIIrd Report on Competition Policy — 2003
The Section for the Single Market, Production and Consumption, which was responsible for preparing the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 11 January 2005. The rapporteur was Mr Chiriaco.
At its 414th plenary session, held on 9 and 10 February 2005 (meeting of 9 February), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion with 75 votes in favour and one abstention:
1. Introduction
1.1 The 2003 annual report highlights changes to the internal organisation of the sector and to the working methods of the Commission, and documents the way the Commission secures coherence within the fabric of European economic governance.
1.2 EU competition policy plays an important role in achieving the competitiveness goals set out in the Lisbon strategy. It encompasses not only antitrust and merger rules, but also the application of an efficient and firm state aid discipline.
1.3 To enable trouble-free accession for the 10 new Member States, the Commission developed a common set of competition rules for all the Member States, to ensure fair application of state aid rules, highlighting the importance of tackling state intervention which distorts competition, with the same commitment as is applied to company law.
1.4 In 2003, 815 new cases of competition law infringements were recorded, and measures included the establishment of the post of consumer liaison officer to ensure a permanent dialogue with European consumers, whose welfare is the prime concern of competition policy, but whose voice is not sufficiently heard when individual cases are handled or policy issues discussed. The role of the consumer liaison officer is not confined to merger control, but also concerns the antitrust field — cartels and abuses of dominant positions — as well as other competition-related policies.
1.5 In October 2003, the European Commission published draft rules and guidelines on technology transfer licensing agreements, on which the EESC has already issued an opinion [1]. The proposed reform takes into account developments in this type of agreement in recent years and is aimed at simplifying and broadening the scope of the Community block exemption regulation. The new provisions offer the following advantages:
- the block exemption regulation will have only a black list: whatever is not explicitly excluded from the block exemption is now exempted;
- a clear distinction is drawn between agreements between competitors and agreements between non-competitors;
- there are already plans to adopt a "modernisation package".
1.6 The Commission appointed a chief competition economist to take up office on 1 September 2003, while also giving a positive boost to the role of the hearing officer. The chief economist has three main tasks:
- to provide guidance on economics and econometrics in the application of EU competition rules; this may include contributing to the development of general policy instruments;
- to provide general guidance in individual competition cases from the early stages;
- to provide detailed guidance in the most important competition cases involving complex economic issues, in particular those requiring sophisticated quantitative analysis.
1.7 Hearing officers, meanwhile, have been granted greater powers and autonomy in the role of defending the right to be heard in certain competition proceedings. They are directly answerable to the commissioner responsible and do not take instructions from the Competition DG. They may intervene whenever legitimate due process issues are at stake, must organise and conduct oral hearings objectively, and decide whether third parties should be heard and whether fresh documents may be produced. They refer to the relevant Commissioner on all issues.
2. Application of antitrust rules — Treaty Articles 81 and 82
2.1 In October 2003, the Commission launched the final phase in the process of reforming the enforcement of EU antitrust rules (known as the modernisation package) to facilitate the application of the enforcement powers vested in the competition authorities and to elaborate on the cooperation mechanisms with national competition authorities (NCAs) and national courts provided for by Regulation 1/2003.
2.2 The modernisation package contains a new implementing regulation, addressing the modalities for hearing the parties concerned and a range of other procedural issues, such as access to files and the treatment of confidential information. The six draft notices concern in part mechanisms for cooperation within the network of European competition authorities and between the Commission and national courts, the concept of effect on trade between Member States, the treatment of complaints, and guidance letters to be issued to assist companies in assessing novel or unresolved questions. For comments on the modernisation package as a whole, the reader is referred to the EESC opinion [1].
2.3 In 2003, the Commission issued five decisions against unlawful horizontal agreements, involving: French beef, sorbates, electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products, organic peroxides, and industrial copper tubes. The fines imposed totalled EUR 400 million. The level of fines set should act as a deterrent. Investigations involve company inspections. Full immunity is granted to companies that are first to reveal the existence of an agreement and that provide sufficient evidence to carry out an investigation. The Commission will express a favourable opinion in cases where agreements between companies do not restrict competition on the relevant markets, and where consumers benefit from the cooperation. Also in 2003, the Commission ruled on three cases of violations of Article 82, relating to:
- the rates imposed by Deutsche Telekom AG on competing companies for access to the local infrastructure of its telecommunications network,
- Wanadoo's pricing strategy for ADSL services, and
- the abuse of a dominant position by Ferrovie dello Stato SpA in markets for access to the rail network, traction and passenger services.
3. Competition policy developments at sectoral level
3.1 2003 brought significant, though not entirely satisfactory, progress for the liberalisation process in the energy sector (electricity and gas). In June, a legislative package was passed ensuring that all European consumers will be able to choose their supplier by 1 July 2007. These provisions aim to strike a balance between incentives to build new infrastructure and the completion of the common market.
3.2 Nevertheless, there is still widespread dissatisfaction among consumers and companies in various EU countries regarding the persistently high prices and relative efficiency of these services. In the new Member States in particular, social partners and consumer organisations strongly emphasise the need for national competition authorities and public utility regulators to be guaranteed full independence.
3.2.1 When appropriate and comprehensive competition legislation is in place, it is sometimes the case, in the new Member States in particular, that monitoring and enforcement agencies encounter difficulties in fulfilling their role independently. As a result, competition legislation sometimes fails to promote either consumer interests or market efficiency. The Committee is in favour of a more functional relationship between competition policy and consumer protection policies. A more organised and involved consumer movement could also aid government decision-making, and provide information on markets and anti-competitive practices.
3.3 In the field of postal services, the directive adopted in 2002 is geared towards completion of the internal market, in particular through a progressive reduction of the reserved area and the liberalisation of outgoing cross-border mail. Furthermore, on the basis of an agreement reached by the European Council, the Commission will carry out a study in 2006 to assess the impact of universal services for every Member State. Working from the results of that study, it will adopt a proposal to open up the postal market completely from 2009, including measures to secure the universal nature of the service.
3.4 The deadline for transposing the new regulatory package on electronic communications expired in July 2004. In its report on the subject, the Commission stressed the following principles in particular: markets must be analysed on the basis of the principles of competition; operators can be regulated only if they have a dominant position; all electronic communications services and networks are to be treated in a similar manner (technological neutrality). Development of, and generalised access to, electronic communications are not enough in themselves to secure the relaunch of economic growth. For that it is fundamental to increase the knowledge and skills levels of all those required to use information and communication technologies.
3.5 In the air transport sector, in 2003 the Commission decided to launch a comprehensive and non-case-related dialogue with all the industry stakeholders, in order to prepare transparent guidelines on competition enforcement issues in the field of airline alliances and mergers.
3.5.1 Progress has also been made on defining and implementing common guidelines on the application of antitrust rules in the rail sector for both goods and passenger transport.
3.5.2 In addition, there have been developments in industry dialogue in the maritime transport, motor vehicle distribution and insurance sectors, with a view to adopting or revising block exemption regulations.
3.5.3 This dialogue should also consider comparable forms of tax treatment.
3.6 Media: the Commission believes that media pluralism is fundamental to both the development of the EU and the cultural identity of the Member States, but stresses that responsibility for the control of media concentration rests primarily with the Member States. The application of competition policy instruments is limited to addressing the structure of the underlying market and economic impact of media undertakings' behaviour, and to controlling state aid. They cannot replace national media concentration controls and measures to ensure media pluralism. The function of competition rules is limited to resolving problems raised by the creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the respective markets and the foreclosure of competitors from those markets.
3.6.1 It can be seen that the Commission's approach, though correct in theory, has not been able to prevent or oppose dominant positions and the related anti-competitive practices in certain countries in particular. Different markets are concerned, and the television advertising market, not yet adequately examined, is of increasing importance when it comes to protecting pluralism.
3.6.2 Furthermore, the methods some media groups use to strengthen a dominant position have been overlooked, in particular the use of poison pills and multiple voting rights which permit a minority shareholder to control a company through voting rights in excess of their shareholding.
3.6.3 The Commission will therefore have to be exceptionally vigilant in the application of competition rules and practices.
3.7 Liberal professions: A study carried out for the Commission by the Vienna-based Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS) has been made accessible to the public. The study reveals differing levels of regulation of service provision among Member States and among the various professions. The study concludes that in countries with less regulation and more freedom in the professions, more wealth can be created overall.
3.7.1 The conference on the regulation of professional services held in Brussels in October 2003 brought together 260 representatives of the professions to discuss the effects of rules and regulations on business structure and consumer protection.
3.7.2 At the conference, Commissioner Monti announced the Commission's intention to issue a report on competition in professional services in 2004. This report, which contains some important pointers and guidelines, was published on 9 February 2004.
4. Reform of the merger control system
4.1 On 27 November 2003, the Council reached a political agreement on a recast Merger Regulation incorporating most of the reforms proposed by the Commission in December 2002. These reforms involved non-legislative measures designed to streamline the decision-making process, strengthen economic analysis and provide better protection for the rights of defence. In addition, a chief competition economist was appointed and panels set up to ensure the conclusions are totally independent. On the subject of merger evaluation, the reader is referred to the EESC opinion on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of companies with share capital [2].
4.2 Objective: to ensure that the substantive test in the Merger Regulation (dominance test) would cover all anti-competitive mergers effectively while at the same time ensuring continued legal certainty. The substantive test criteria were compared with those of the "substantial lessening of competition" test and the terms of the new test adopted are as follows: "a concentration which would significantly impede effective competition, in the common market or in a substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position, shall be declared incompatible with the common market". 4.2.1 The new regulation, in stating "in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening …" hints at potential for enlarging the scope of application of the ban, no longer strictly linked to the requirement of a dominant position. Nevertheless, this rule will have to be interpreted in the light of the content of the joint Council and Commission declaration on Article 2 with reference to the 25th recital to the Regulation [3], which states that this concept "should be interpreted as extending, beyond the concept of dominance, only to the anti-competitive effects of a concentration resulting from the non-coordinated behaviour of undertakings which would not have a dominant position on the market concerned.". It follows that the scope will continue to be defined in relation to the concept of dominance.
4.3 Guidelines on assessing horizontal mergers: i.e. mergers between competing, or potentially competing, firms. These mergers will only be unlawful to the extent that they enhance the market power of companies in a manner which is likely to have adverse consequences for consumers, notably in the form of higher prices, poorer quality products, or reduced choice. This is irrespective of whether the anticompetitive effects result from the creation or strengthening of a single dominant market player or from a situation of oligopoly. The impact of a merger will, moreover, be assessed in relation to what would otherwise have occurred in the market. This may mean, for example, that the acquisition of a failing firm would not justify intervention by the Commission.
4.4 New best practices: as part of the 2002 package of reforms, a consultation was held and completed in February 2003. The aim was to provide guidance for interested parties on the day-to-day conduct of EU merger control proceedings.
5. International cooperation
5.1 The Commission is an active participant in the International Competition Network's Working Group on multi-jurisdictional merger control. The group's activities have been in three sub-groups:
- notification and procedures,
- investigation techniques,
- analytical framework.
5.1.1 The Commission takes part in the work of all three sub-groups. The basic aim is to improve mutual understanding between different jurisdictions so as to make merger control activities more effective.
5.1.2 More generally, the ICN acts as a virtual network between various national competition authorities, with a view to facilitating international cooperation and making proposals to reduce regulatory costs and encourage procedural harmonisation and real convergence.
5.1.3 The Second ICN Conference held in Merida, Mexico in June 2003 highlighted the need to adopt clear and easily accessible language in the area of competition rules and also stressed the strategic nature of activities promoting competition in the field of regulated sectors, with a view to reducing regulatory costs and overcoming obstacles to a mutual understanding of merger policy between jurisdictions.
6. State aid
6.1 The control of state aid focuses on the effects on competition of aid measures granted by Member States to undertakings. Objective: to ensure that government interventions do not interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market, to foster competition and competitive markets and to enhance structural reforms. Particular attention is given to ensuring that the beneficial effects of liberalisation are not undermined by state aid measures. Stockholm European Council: Member States are to reduce the general level of state aid and redirect it towards horizontal objectives of Community interest (strengthening of economic and social cohesion, employment, environmental protection, and promotion of SME R&amp;D). The Commission considers the recovery of unlawful aid granted by Member States a priority.
6.1.1 In this context, the failure of a number of Member States to open up their public purchasing to bidders from other Member States is highly regrettable. Public procurement in the EU totals over EUR 1,500 billion annually and certain Member States' practice of favouring "national champions" harms competition and adds to the tax burden on consumers.
6.2 State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty: The relevant guidelines, which expired in October 2004, stated that aid may be regarded as compatible only under certain strict conditions. These guidelines have been reviewed, with a special focus on the following issues:
- ensuring that rescue aid is limited to reversible, temporary, short-term financial support which is granted only for so long as is necessary to put a comprehensive restructuring plan into effect;
- focusing state aid control on large enterprises that trade across the EU;
- reinforcing the principle, in particular in the case of large enterprises, that the aid recipient is obliged to finance a large part of the restructuring cost without any state aid;
- applying the "one time, last time" principle.
6.3 Multisectoral Framework for large investment projects: strict rules in sectors with structural difficulties. A list of such sectors was to have been established by the end of 2003. Due to methodological and technical difficulties, the Commission has decided to postpone the adoption of the list and to extend the existing transitional rules for large investment projects in "sensitive" sectors until December 2006.
6.4 R&amp;D aid for SMEs: aid for research and development can contribute to economic growth, strengthening competitiveness and boosting employment. For SMEs, this is particularly important.
6.5 Environmental aid, research and development aid, training aid, fiscal aid In the latter field, special attention has been given to alternative taxation methods, such as the cost-plus method (taxable income calculated on a flat-rate basis as a percentage of the amount of operating expenditure and expenses). In the field of sectoral aid (see in particular the application of the temporary defensive mechanism (TDM)), the following sectors have been addressed: steel, telecommunications, coal, rail transport, combined transport, road transport, maritime transport and air transport.
6.6 Agriculture: on 23 December 2003, the Commission adopted a new regulation introducing a block exemption regime for certain categories of state aid, meaning that Member States no longer need to notify them in advance to the Commission for approval. The new regulation, which will apply until the end of 2006, concerns state aid granted to SMEs in the agricultural sector. In view of the definition of an SME (no more than 250 employees, a turnover of no more than EUR 40 million or a balance-sheet total of no more than EUR 27 million), the provisions cover almost all agricultural sector enterprises. Lastly, the Commission is introducing a new transparency standard: a summary of all exempted state aid measures, by Member State, will be published on the Internet five days before the aid is first paid out, so as to ensure all interested parties have all the necessary information.
7. General assessment
7.1 Having summed up and offered some comments on the Commission's XXXIIIrd report on competition policy in 2003, the Committee will now make a number of general observations on the report as a whole and in particular on its most significant, forward-looking aspects.
7.2 Relationship between competition policy and economic growth policy
7.2.1 The introduction of new procedures for applying antitrust rules, the review of the Merger Regulation and the new organisational set-up in the Commission have made the European Union's competition policy more efficient and more open to a positive relationship with companies and consumers.
7.2.2 Competition policy has enabled the EU to make considerable steps forward in the liberalisation process, by restoring entire economic sectors to the logic and dynamic of the market and thus making a practical contribution to the creation of a single European market. Competition policy is therefore essential and must always be allowed full autonomy.
7.2.3 Working alone, it cannot however meet the particularly acute need throughout the EU for an intense upturn in growth and for a sustainable economic development policy based on innovation and social dialogue. Structural changes in production and world trade, starting with those generated by the new technological system, require the Commission to launch and coordinate other economic policy instruments. The goal is to safeguard and revive the competitiveness of the European economy and to bolster economic and social cohesion, employment and environmental protection while also promoting major, weighty research and development programmes. This is the thrust of the Commission's communication on Fostering structural change: an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe and the relevant EESC opinion [4]. The Lisbon agenda outlines the way ahead. Its implementation must however be facilitated and speeded up at both general and sectoral levels.
7.2.3.1 At sectoral level, in confirmation of the points it made in its opinion of 30 June 2004 on LeaderSHIP 2015 — Defining the Future of the European Shipbuilding and Repair Industry — Competitiveness through Excellence [5], the EESC would reiterate the need to push forward with the new fully integrated approach defined by the Competitiveness Council of November 2003 with a view to strengthening industrial competition and encouraging all sectors of research, development and innovation.
7.3 State aid and services of general interest
7.3.1 The reform process designed to streamline and simplify procedures for the control of state aid has made major progress, following the course set by the Stockholm European Council towards reducing the level of state aid and redirecting it towards horizontal objectives of Community interest, including the cohesion objectives. Examples of this are a number of measures adopted by the Commission, such as extending to a degree the scope of aid to research and development; producing guidelines on technology transfer agreements, on restructuring companies in difficulty, and on aid for training and for environmental protection; and establishing multisectoral rules for major investment projects.
7.3.2 With its judgment on the Altmark case in July 2003, the Court of Justice confirmed that compensation to companies responsible for providing services of general interest will be excluded from the definition of state aid, subject to a few conditions. There are still some unresolved issues, however, relating in particular to establishing an optimal link between state aid and services of general interest (SGI). The nature of the conditions imposed by the Court demands an improvement in legal certainty, particularly in the area of assessing costs, defining financing for services [4] and specifying more clearly the public service obligations eligible for compensation. Meanwhile, the Green Paper on services of general interest (SGI), published in May 2003, had already acknowledged the need to assess whether the principles governing SGI should be further consolidated within a general Community framework, and to define optimal rules for the services and measures, in order to increase legal certainty for all operators.
7.3.3 If they are not correctly defined and financed, universal service obligations could cause the companies responsible to suffer increasing losses, owing to the potential entry of competitors into the most profitable areas of their activity.
7.3.4 The EESC would therefore stress the need, already highlighted in its opinion [1] on the Commission's Green Paper, to adopt a clear legal text on SGI in order to secure effective and fair access for all users to high quality services that meet their requirements. Furthermore, it recommends instigating as broad as possible a dialogue with the social partners and NGOs, particularly regarding the reorganisation and functioning of social services.
7.4 Liberal professions
7.4.1 The in-depth analyses carried out by the Commission on the regulatory systems for professional services in the Member States have proved very useful, as they have reinforced the message on the need to carefully review the restrictive regulations in this field and to make the major cultural and knowledge-related resources existing in the professional world more productive and competitive. This clearly brings major benefits, not just for the professionals themselves, but also for firms and consumers.
7.4.2 The principle repeated several times by the Court of Justice is now generally accepted, namely, that suppliers of professional services must also respect competition rules. While it is absolutely true that economic criteria cannot be the only parameter by which professional services are assessed, as they are not simply repetitive technical applications but rather services that apply knowledge to a problem, it is also true that they are an economic activity which, when carried out with respect for competition rules, generate greater welfare and can make an important contribution to the Lisbon agenda.
7.4.2.1 The content of the Commission Communication on Competition in Professional Services [6] is interesting in this respect. This report in fact underscores the important role the professional services can play in improving the competitiveness of the European economy, inasmuch as they are essential inputs for companies and families. At the same time, it uses empirical research to argue the negative effects that excessive or outdated regulations, such as those regarding pricing, advertising, entry requirements, exclusive rights and business structure, can and do have on consumers.
7.4.3 The priority is therefore to implement and accelerate the reform process. To this end, the EESC urges the Commission to stand by its commitment to publish a new report on "progress in eliminating restrictive and unjustified rules" in 2005. In this context, the Commission has also committed itself to looking more closely at the link between the level of regulation, economic results (prices and quality) and consumer satisfaction.
7.4.4 Meanwhile, the EESC would reiterate the importance of the Court of Justice ruling of 9 October 2003 on the Consorzio Industria Fiammiferi case, which allows the national authorities to "disapply" national rules obliging companies to engage in conduct contrary to Article 81.
7.4.5 Lastly, efforts must be made to promote greater and more informed involvement in the reform process on the part of the sectors concerned.
7.5 Plurality of information and competition law
7.5.1 In its XXXIIIrd report on competition policy, the Commission states that maintaining and developing media pluralism and the freedom to provide and receive information are fundamental objectives of the European Union as values crucial to the democratic process. It also states that responsibility for the control of media concentration rests primarily with the Member States. The application of competition policy instruments in the media sector, it adds, is limited to addressing the problems raised by the creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the respective markets and the control of foreclosure of competitors from those markets. In the EESC's opinion, the distinction between the EU's tasks and those of national governments is somewhat vague, and also leaves a number of important issues unresolved:
- It should be noted that in the various Member States there are differing regulations and approaches requiring harmonisation: the Commission began the process in 1989 and then continued in 1997 with the Television without Frontiers directive, whose objectives were not only economic efficiency but also respect for cultural diversity, protection of minors, right of reply, etc.
- A distinction must be drawn in the media field between general antitrust rules and rules specifically designed to defend the pluralism of information. Operational competition rules are a basic condition for promoting pluralism, but not enough in themselves. Unlike a competitive system in which the market power of each company must face up to the initiative and activities of competing companies, the promotion and defence of pluralism demands the explicit recognition of the public's right to have effective access to independent sources of information and to alternative and potentially differing information, a right that should be protected at all levels.
- Lastly, the process of the gradual convergence between telecommunications, IT, radio, television and publishing makes it difficult to pinpoint the structures of the various markets. The danger of failing to properly understand this process is that the competition rules will be diminished and the principle of pluralism weakened.
7.5.2 The new European Constitution will significantly expand the Commission's brief. The EESC is convinced that the new legal framework will inject additional vigour into the Commission's role in guiding and/or intervening directly to defend and develop the freedom and pluralism of information.

Title
Proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the sole stocks in the Western Channel and the Bay of Biscay | Proposal for a Council regulation establishing a management plan for sole stocks in the Western Channel and the Bay of Biscay (This amendment entails replacing "recovery" by "management" throughout the text with the exception of the last line of Article 3(3)). |
Amendment 2
Recital 1
(1) Recent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has indicated that the sole stocks in ICES Divisions VIIe and VIIIa, b have been subjected to levels of mortality by fishing which have eroded the quantities of mature fish in the sea to the point at which the stocks may not be able to replenish themselves by reproduction and that the stocks are therefore threatened with collapse. | Deleted |
Amendment 3
Recital 2
(2) Measures need to be taken to establish multi-annual plans for the recovery of these stocks in conformity with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy. | (2) Management measures should be taken for these stocks in conformity with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy. |
Amendment 4
Recital 3
(3) The objectives of the plans should be to rebuild these stocks to safe biological limits within five to ten years. | (3) The objectives of the plans should be to ensure that these stocks remain within safe biological limits. |
Amendment 5
Recital 3a (new)
| (3a) The objective of the new common fisheries policy is to provide for the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources, taking account of the environmental, social and economic aspects in a balanced manner. |
Amendment 6
Recital 3b (new)
| (3b) In implementing the plan, the Commission and the Member States should ensure the full participation of the Regional Advisory Councils and other stakeholders. |
Amendment 7
Recital 5
(5) The absolute sizes of the stocks concerned as estimated by STECF and ICES are too uncertain to be used as targets for the recovery and the targets should be expressed in terms of fishing mortality rates. | Deleted |
Amendment 8
Recital 6
(6) In order to achieve that objective, the levels of fishing mortality rates need to be controlled so that it is highly likely that those rates are reduced from year to year. | Deleted |
Amendment 9
Recital 8
(8) Once recovery has been achieved the Council should decide on a proposal from the Commission on follow-up measures in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. | Deleted |
Amendment 10
Article 2
The recovery plan shall aim to rebuild the sole stocks concerned to within safe biological limits. | The management plan shall aim to maintain the sole stocks concerned within safe biological limits. |
Amendment 12
Article 3, paragraph 2
2. Where the Commission finds, on the basis of the annual evaluation, that any of the sole stocks concerned has reached the objective set out in Article 2, the Council shall decide by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission to replace, for that stock, the recovery plan provided for in this Regulation by a management plan in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. | Deleted |
Amendment 13
Article 3, paragraph 3
3. Where the Commission finds, on the basis of the annual evaluation, that any of the sole stocks concerned do not show proper sign of recovery, the Council shall decide by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission on additional and/or alternative measures to ensure recovery of the stock concerned. | 3. Where the Commission finds, on the basis of the annual evaluation, that any of the sole stocks concerned are at risk of collapse, the Council shall decide by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission on additional and/or alternative measures to ensure recovery of the stock concerned. |
Amendment 14
Article 5, paragraph 1
1. Where the fishing mortality rate for one of the sole stocks concerned has been estimated by the STECF in the light of the most recent report of ICES to be above 0,14 per year, the TAC for that stock shall not exceed a level of catches which, according to a scientific evaluation carried out by the STECF in the light of the most recent report of ICES, will result in a reduction of: (a)20% in the fishing mortality rate in its year of application, compared to the fishing mortality rate estimated for the preceding year with regard to the sole stock in Division VIIe;(b)35% in the fishing mortality rate in its year of application, compared to the fishing mortality rate estimated for the preceding year with regard to the sole stock in Divisions VIIIa and b. | 1. The TAC shall not exceed a level of catches for which a scientific evaluation by the STECF, carried out in the light of the most recent report of ICES, has shown that it will result in a 15% increase in the quantities of adult fish in the sea, at the end of its year of application, by comparison with the quantities estimated to be present in the sea at the start of the year in question. |
Amendment 15

The Council shall not adopt a TAC which the STEFC, in the light of the most recent report of ICES, expects would result, in the year of its application, in a fishing mortality rate in excess of the following values: Bay of Biscay sole: 0,36; Western Channel sole: rate to be defined in view of subsequent ICES advice, following the inclusion of data series from certain countries which are currently not taken into account. |
Amendment 16
Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2
1. In the first year of application of this Regulation, the following rules shall apply: (a)where application of Article 5 would result in a TAC which exceeds the TAC of the preceding year by more than 25 %, the Council shall adopt a TAC which shall not be more than 25 % greater than the TAC of that year;(b)where application of Article 5 would result in a TAC which is more than 25 % less than the TAC of the preceding year, the Council shall adopt a TAC which is not more than 25 % less than the TAC of that year. | |

Amendment 22
Opinion of the Committee of the Regions on The period of reflection: the structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union
(2006/C 81/09)
THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS,
HAVING REGARD TO the decision of the European Parliament of 6 September 2005 to consult it on this matter, under the fourth paragraph of Article 265 of the Treaty establishing the European Community;
HAVING REGARD TO the decision of its President of 27 July 2005 to appoint, in accordance with Rule 40(2) of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Franz Schausberger, Representative of Land Salzburg in the Committee of the Regions (AT-EPP) and Cllr Lord Tope, Greater London Authority (UK/ALDE) as rapporteurs-general for the opinion on this matter;
HAVING REGARD TO the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe signed by the heads of state or government on 29 October 2004 (CIG 87/04 rev. 1, CIG 87/04 Add 1 rev. 1, CIG 87/04 Add 2 rev. 1);
HAVING REGARD TO its opinion of 17 November 2004 on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (CoR 354/2003 fin [1]);
HAVING REGARD TO its report of 6 November 2001 on Proximity (CdR 436/2000 fin);
adopted the following opinion at its 61st plenary session, held on 12 and 13 October 2005 (meeting of 13 October):
VIEWS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS
The Committee of the Regions:
(a) Context
1. believes that, in order to safeguard peace, freedom and prosperity, a politically strong and democratic European Union, strong European leadership and strong interinstitutional cooperation to relaunch the European project are needed;
2. expresses concern that too long a period of reflection would damage the EU's public image, and urges all institutions to work to reclaim and relaunch the core European ideal and project;
3. considers it advisable to use this period for reflection to examine what the public in the Member States thinks about the European Union and to consolidate the fundamental aims, values and principles of the EU, such as solidarity, effectiveness, transparency and cooperation, based on the support of its citizens;
4. reiterates the importance of the fundamental rights of the Union as enshrined in the charter included in the Constitutional Treaty;
5. believes that the European Union must take the results of the French and Dutch referenda seriously and must be seen to do so; considers that to proceed with the ratification process of the Constitutional Treaty without altering the original schedule and without serious reflection at European level would send a negative message to Europe's citizens and might engender further rejections in Member States;
6. recognises however that the reasons for those rejections are many and varied and in some cases may not be in response to the Treaty itself; thus considers it fundamental to concentrate efforts above all on the context of the debate, focusing it on a successful agreement of the financial perspectives; reiterates however that more than a half of all Member States have already ratified the Treaty by their chosen method and the decisions of these Member States must count as much as those who voted against;
7. reaffirms its commitment to the Constitutional Treaty and its advances which guarantee better European governance through its considerable improvement in the functioning, simplicity and transparency of the EU compared to the existing treaties;
8. considers that in broadening out the debate on the future of the European Union its institutions should focus on the actual and potential practical benefits that membership and citizenship bring to its citizens;
9. in order to rebuild the trust of European citizens in the European project, calls on the EU institutions to:
- take decisions which are pending in those areas where the Union brings real added value to Europe's citizens;
- begin functioning in a much more decentralised manner, respecting and promoting the subsidiarity principle, which should be applied also on subnational levels;
- pro-actively demonstrate that a political union will not undermine Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity;
- show that Europe will provide its citizens with opportunities to develop their personal and professional experience at a European level;
- establish a permanent two-way dialogue with Europe's citizens;
- develop a culture of enhanced transparency, especially by making the workings of the Council more accessible, to enable citizens to better understand the EU decision-making process;
10. calls for the continuation of activities promoting the principle of subsidiarity in all areas and drawing on the advantages that the greater proximity of regional and local institutions can offer to citizens;
11. calls upon the Member States to deepen political integration of the EU, which constitutes a fundamental basis to develop an enlarged Union, defining the aims, potential geographical limits and long term objectives of the integration process within the European Union; whereas EU membership shall entail respect for local and regional democratic self-government within the established constitutional framework of each country;
12. calls on politicians at Member State, regional and local levels to take the responsibility for their own actions in the areas falling in their responsibility and to refrain from the common habit of using "Brussels" as scapegoat; underlines that the European Union can only succeed if politicians at European, national, regional and local level divide duties responsibly and acknowledge that institutional respect is essential for success, as a prerequisite for good governance;
(b) Structure of the debate
13. believes that it is necessary for the EU institutions to engage in debate with the people and communities that they represent, reflecting the open approach taken to the drafting of the Treaty through a Convention that involved representatives of national parliaments, political parties, local and regional government, civil society as well as social partners. In this debate, it is essential to make clear to the public the added political, economic and social value of a European Union;
14. considers that in its capacity as institutional representative of local and regional government in the European Union, it has to play an active role in political and institutional initiatives during the period of reflection announced by the heads ofstate and government; to this end, proposes a roadmap [2] with a view to establishing a truly decentralised debate;
15. calls on local and regional government to engage and inform their communities on the issues that affect them in the debate on the future of the European Union and to better explain the processes and practical achievements of European integration through a decentralised regional and local based information policy, believing that a debate conducted solely at the European level will fail to reach out to the general public, therefore necessitating structured debates with transnational elements led nationally, regionally and locally, involving its members and supported by the EU institutions;
16. moreover, reaffirms the bottom-up approach, that is its hallmark, and commits itself, with the help of its members, to seek out and take on board the requests of regional and local authorities on Community policies and institutions, and to forward their input, not least in terms of political analysis and innovative proposals, to the European institutions;
17. recommends that dialogue with citizens should not be limited to one-off campaigns and should not focus on details of institutional workings; urges therefore the Union to focus on communicating information which is of direct practical benefit to citizens and which allows them to take advantage of EU opportunities available to them;
18. calls on the European institutions, Member States and the regional and local authorities to establish new and creative ways of interacting with citizens at grassroots, using for the debate modern electronic media (e.g. "Europe listens" in Austria and "National forum on Europe" in Ireland), and to ensure that the message is accessible in the native language of the citizen, and not only in selected EU languages; furthermore there is some responsibility on the institutions and Member States to counter factually incorrect statements about the European Union that citizens may be presented with, especially in the media;
19. recognises the vital role of the local and regional media, and in particular the local press, in this context, not least because they can communicate to citizens in lay terms and in their local language;
(c) Subjects for reflection
General scope
20. considers that the provisions of the Constitutional Treaty relating to the Union's territorial dimension and the involvement of local and regional authorities, both institutionally through the CoR and more generally, constitute an important and positive development;
21. calls upon the EU institutions to help to develop a real "subsidiarity culture" within the Union, its Member States, and its regional and local authorities, and to apply without delay the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality provided for in the Constitutional Treaty as a simple and effective way to demonstrate to citizens that the Union will act only where the added value is clear and in respect for its principle of better lawmaking;
22. calls for application of the concept of "proximity" in the application of EU policies and law, as this would be a visible sign of the will to implement procedures for more transparency as an immediate reaction to citizens' concerns; in this context the introduction of a new legal instrument facilitating interregional and cross-border cooperation, including economic and social cooperation, could be seen, for instance, as a clear sign towards a closer Europe of the citizens;
23. underlines that whereas it would be desirable for these elements to have a place in the Treaty, many of the actions and obligations arising from these provisions can be integrated immediately into the Community's activities, such as extending impact assessments to include the financial and administrative impact of new EU law on local and regional authorities;
24. has in particular welcomed the following points in the Treaty as articles of good governance and wishes to ensure that their safeguard and implementation are fully considered during the period of reflection:
- recognition of the role of local and regional authorities in EU governance;
- better consultation prior to publication of legislative proposals;
- account to be taken of the financial and administrative burden falling on local or regional authorities;
- a broader definition of subsidiarity to incorporate local and regional government;
- recognition of the cultural and linguistic diversity as a source of wealth to be preserved, alongside the fundamental principle of cooperation and integration;
- enhancement of the role of the Committee of the Regions, in particular introduction of the right of recourse to the European Court of Justice in respect of its own prerogatives or breaches of subsidiarity;
- reference to representative associations (e.g. of local or regional government);
Topical issues for the debate
25. considers that it is vitally important that the EU has the appropriate level of resources to undertake the tasks assigned to it; recalls its support for the European Commission proposals for the financial perspective during 2007-13;
26. considers that now is the appropriate time to start reflecting on the basis for funding the EU budget in the long term, and to reinforce democratic control of the budget through the European Parliament;
27. reminds Member States that cohesion policy is an area where the EU has long demonstrated its real added value, whose visibility enables citizens to appreciate daily the EU's practical and positive work, and which represents the basis of European solidarity and thus distinguishes the European social model from other examples of transnational integration;
28. reiterates its support for the Partnership for Growth and Jobs (Lisbon Strategy) as a balanced approach between the economic goals, sustainable development and the modernisation and advancement of Europe's social model;
29. believes that strengthening the EU's competitiveness also requires helping Europe's citizens to develop their talents and creativity beyond national borders; furthermore, believes that the value of a culturally diverse Union will become much more tangible to Europeans when they begin to experience life in a European context; therefore, in order to strengthen competitiveness and to connect citizens with the European project, stresses the need for the EU to continue facilitating free movement of people and to promoting greater mobility within the Union;
30. endorses its support for the EU strategy on sustainable development and stresses in particular that Community actions and funding for improving the environment should have powerful effects at the national, regional and local levels;
31. recalls the unique character of European citizenship, as an element of identity, which does not replace national citizenship;
32. calls for much greater investment and collaboration in education (including life-long learning opportunities for all citizens), research and innovation at European and national level as the best means to create more and better jobs for Europe's citizens and to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the global economy;
33. is convinced that to better explain Europe and its policies, national, regional and local authorities should implement educational efforts, for example via the introduction of special courses in schools, European dimension in the school curricula, post-school education and training for teachers;
34. is, moreover, convinced that a positive European culture must be disseminated among regional and local public officials, who in their daily work must deal with regulations;
(d) Assessment
35. invites the EU institutions and the Member States to listen to the citizens in order to evaluate the results of the debate during the period of reflection;
36. is conscious that during the period of reflection various different scenarios are likely to be discussed, but is against abandoning this Constitutional Treaty in favour of the Nice Treaty, and calls for a consensual approach towards ratification by 2009;
37. wishes to actively participate in the relaunching of the constitutional process and offers to the European Parliament support for its efforts to secure a successful outcome.

Third package of legislative measures on maritime safety in the European Union (Text with EEA relevance)
In the wake of the Prestige accident in November 2002 there was an emotional wave of solidarity throughout Europe, and the institutions and highest authorities of the European Union expressed their firm resolve that the policy of strengthening maritime safety pursued following the Erika accident in December 1999 should be continued and reinforced.
At its meeting in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December 2002, shortly after the Prestige accident, the European Council acknowledged the determined efforts in the European Community and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) since the Erika accident to enhance maritime safety and pollution prevention and stated that the Union was determined to take all necessary measures to avoid a repetition of similar disasters.
This determination is also shared by the European Parliament which, in its Resolution on safety at sea adopted on 27 April 2004 based on the work of the Temporary Committee on Improving Safety at Sea (MARE)[1], confirmed the need to continue the efforts.
That Resolution stresses in particular a number of concrete measures called for by the European Parliament with a view to improving maritime safety at international and European level, in particular by:
- creating a “European maritime safety area”, including the banning of substandard vessels and the introduction of a system of liability covering the entire maritime transport chain and the public authorities responsible for safety at sea;
- establishing an operational framework making it possible to intervene more effectively in the event of accidents and limit their potential consequences, in particular in view of a better use of places of refuge;
- improving the cover for accidental damage, through strengthened requirements concerning compulsory insurance and compensation;
- stepping up cooperation and affirming the principle of independent maritime accident investigations;
- reinforcing ship inspections through rigorous application of port State control and greater monitoring of the activities of classification societies.
The Erika and Prestige accidents have resulted in a significant strengthening of safety rules at European level and, in some cases, a drastic reduction in specific risks, such as those arising from the transport of heavy fuel oil in single-hull tankers.
These efforts need to be continued and intensified. The response to these requirements must take into account the importance of the shipping industry to Europe's competitiveness.
In this context, the Commission is proposing a third package of legislative measures designed to improve safety at sea, following on from the Erika-I and Erika-II packages[2], while at the same time strengthening the competitiveness of our flag. This package is fully in line with the Commission's strategic objectives for the period 2005-2009[3], since, in setting out its vision of "Europe 2010, a partnership for European renewal - Prosperity, solidarity and security", the Commission stressed that an essential aspect of quality of life is a policy which manages and reduces the risks with which people are confronted, such as the risks of accidents at sea. The measures that the Commission is proposing today are in line with this objective.
Lastly, more generally, the third package will help to strengthen the safety aspects of the integrated European maritime policy being developed, the prospects for which will be stressed in the announced “Green Paper on the future Maritime Policy of the Union: a vision for Oceans and Seas” due to be published in the first half of 2006. This integrated policy will strive to achieve a fair balance between the economic, social, environmental, security and safety aspects of shipping activities, ensuring both the conservation of resources and the improvement of competitiveness, long-term growth and employment in the maritime sector.
I. EUROPEAN UNION ACTION TO PROMOTE COMPETITIVE, SAFE AND HIGH-QUALITY MARITIME TRANSPORT
By virtue of the European Union’s geography, its history and the growing globalisation of trade, the economic development of the European Union is still very dependent on maritime transport. For example:
- almost 90% of its external trade in goods and more than 40% of its internal trade goes by sea;
- some 1 billion tonnes of oil enter European Union ports or cross the waters surrounding its territory each year;
- shipping companies owned by European Union nationals control nearly 40% of the world fleet, and the bulk of the external trade of the European Union, the world's leading commercial power, involves ships controlled by economic operators originating in the European Union;
- the maritime sector in the broadest sense, i.e. including shipbuilding, ports, fishing and related industries and services (insurance, banking, etc.), employs around 3 million people in the European Union.
It is therefore vital for the European Union to have a competitive fleet and maritime sector which can ensure its economic future and strengthen its capacity for action at international level. The European Union has, for many years, been pursuing an active policy in support of the competitiveness of its fleet, by means of:
- regulation, e.g. the framework for State aid for the maritime sector, with the Community guidelines revised in 2004 which are intended to promote, in particular, European re-flagging to guarantee greater quality and safety,
- agreements, such as bilateral and international maritime agreements to promote free and non-discriminatory access for European Union operators to the international maritime transport services market,
- aid, in particular in the context of the trans-European transport network, through the establishment of port infrastructure and port access, the promotion of innovative services through the Marco Polo programme, and the development of research in the shipping sector.
The quality of the maritime services offered by operators themselves is also one of the major aspects of competitiveness in the sector. The measures proposed by the Commission in the light of the tragic oil tanker accidents in recent years should therefore be seen as part of the process of strengthening a high-quality maritime sector and seized upon as an opportunity by the best operators to assert their competitiveness on the international market.
Through the third maritime safety package, the Commission contributes to the operation of a transparent shipping sector, leading at Community and international level to the gradual creation of a fair market (level playing field) for maritime transport for the benefit of European operators. It will monitor the strict implementation of existing rules and will continue to promote the cross-fertilisation process initiated between the international regulatory framework and the Community legislation which also contributes to the establishment of fair competition at world level, a fundamental pre-requisite for maintaining the current quality of European flags, through the following measures.
- Rigorous monitoring of the transposition and application of Community legislation on safety at sea. To get the Member States to comply with the obligations, the Commission uses the means available to it under the Treaty and has initiated infringement procedures against Member States which fail in their requirements. These procedures have already resulted in rulings being given against the Member States concerned by the Court of Justice.
- Reinforcing the presence and active participation of the Community in international forums.
The Commission intends to continue and step up the uniform and rigorous application of the international rules adopted under the auspices of the IMO. A similar approach will be pursued concerning the rules of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in the context of the current recasting of the conventions adopted under the auspices of that organisation. In this process, excellent cooperation with the social partners has made it possible to achieve major progress on the new convention which the Commission intends to transpose into Community law.
In addition, in drawing up the third legislative package on maritime safety, the Commission wanted to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy through the improvement and simplification of the existing legislative texts, such as the Directive on port State control and the Directive on classification societies, which have been amended several times. The objective is, in particular, to improve the legibility and effectiveness of the Community regulatory environment, primarily for the benefit of European citizens and maritime transport operators.
Implementation of the measures contained in this package will, where appropriate, involve the European Maritime Safety Agency set up by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[4]. Some of the measures are already provided for in that Regulation. The others will be the subject of a proposal to amend the Regulation setting up the Agency which the Commission intends to submit in the coming months.
To conclude, consolidation of legislation, improvement of the efficiency of maritime administrations, targeting of inspections on ships with a high risk profile and reduction of controls for ships with a good risk profile will contribute significantly to improving the competitiveness of our industry. Safety cannot be dissociated from competitiveness.
II. EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO ENFORCE EXISTING RULES
The Member States are responsible for implementing Community Directives and Regulations.
In its Resolution of 27 April 2004, the European Parliament stressed that “in response to the Erika and Prestige disasters, important legislative measures have been taken to make shipping safer in European waters and that priority must therefore be given to the rapid and complete introduction and strict enforcement of the European rules by the Member States.”
The Commission is determined to assign priority to the proper implementation by the Member States of the Community legislation on maritime safety. With the assistance of the European Maritime Security Agency, it has launched a specific programme to monitor the conformity and application of the maritime security legislation (2005-2007). Implementation of this programme has already resulted in an increase in the number of infringement procedures brought against Member States. On 30 September 2005, 68 maritime safety procedures, including cases of non-communication and complaints were in progress.
The situation regarding the communication of national measures transposing the Directives adopted in the framework of the “Erika” packages has considerably improved (only three cases before the Court of Justice at present). On the other hand, the situation with the more recent texts is not yet satisfactory (31 procedures initiated). In addition, the Commission remains concerned about the quality of certain national texts, in particular those transposing the Directives on port State control and waste reception facilities for which 12 procedures are in progress. Where those Directives are concerned, 19 cases concerning poor application of the national texts in several Member States are at present at various stages.
III. NEED TO STRENGTHEN MARITIME SAFETY AND PREVENT POLLUTION BY SHIPS.
Following the Erika and Prestige accidents, the European Union acted urgently in order to establish a defensive mechanism designed to protect Europe against the risk of accidents and pollution. The European Union has at times been reproached for having a calmer attitude than the United States which, through OPA 90 (Oil Pollution Act), reacted unilaterally to the Exxon Valdez accident[5]. This disregards the fact that Europe is not in a comparable situation to that of the United States. Europe's basic problem is transit traffic, outside the jurisdiction of the Member States, involving high-risk vessels flying the flag of third countries: some 200 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products[6] are moved each year off our coasts without control being possible in a European Union port.
However, the lack of safety at sea is deep-rooted, and is bound up with the inherent features of maritime transport and how it operates. Only a more proactive policy will really make it possible to change the situation and restore, on a lasting basis, healthy competition for operators who comply with international rules.
Strengthening maritime safety rules at international and regional level remains of a fundamental importance for several reasons.
- All the existing data indicate that substandard ships and flags of convenience continue to prosper. According to recent OECD data, 10 to 15% of the world fleet, i.e. between 5 000 and 7 500 ships, fail to comply with international safety standards.
- In addition, Paris Memorandum statistics[7] indicate an increase in the number of shortcomings found during ship inspections[8] concerning, in particular, human aspects and ship management[9]. These figures underline the fact that the legitimate concerns about environmental risks should not allow us to forget the heavy price paid by seafarers for lack of safety at sea.
- Objective reasons to do with the significance and development of maritime traffic in European Union waters: extra-European Union trade in goods by sea has increased in the last five years both in terms of volume and in terms of the value of goods traded. Europe continues to have the biggest volume of maritime traffic, even if the proportion of transit vessels has fallen with enlargement. New traffic routes have been created: Russia, for example, has built large oil terminals which are resulting in a spectacular and rapid increase in maritime traffic in the Gulf of Finland. In 2000, some 40 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products were carried in the Gulf of Finland. According to estimates, this figure could reach 100 to 120 million tonnes by 2010.
- Similarly, the protection of the Mediterranean against the risks of pollution by ships from the Black Sea remains a source of concern. In 2002, 122 million tonnes of oil crossed the Bosporus, on board 7 400 oil tankers. The risk of pollution is likely to increase with the growth in oil production in the Caspian Sea region: assuming that all the oil pipeline expansion or construction projects are completed, the average oil export capacity from the Caspian to the Black Sea terminals would be 2.4 million barrels/day in 2015. These trends, which concern the countries of northern Europe and the Mediterranean, demonstrate the need to develop and intensify the maritime safety component of the dialogue between the Community and its neighbours, particularly in the context of the establishment of the common economic area between the European Union and Russia and through the dialogue established by the European neighbourhood policy[10] which establishes a framework for relations between the enlarged Europe and its neighbours. Under this strategy, action plans have been concluded with the partner countries of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean and entail several measures intended to strengthen cooperation concerning maritime safety policies and improve the efficiency of the implementation of standards for port and flag States.
- Audits carried out by the Commission of the European Union recognised classification societies have shown that the approach must be strengthened to ensure that ship safety is at all times controlled to the highest standards.
- Lastly, international conventions provide to ships’ operators the benefit of a limited liability. Such privilege, which is rare in other industrial sectors, may lead to an erosion of the sense of responsibility in the transport chain. Efforts made to raise the ceilings of compensation levels for victims are not sufficient even though the raising, on the initiative of the Commission, of the ceiling of the IOPC Fund[11] from approximately EUR 240 million to 900 million constitutes a significant improvement.
IV. GOOD COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
The Commission fully recognises the added value of international action in respect of maritime safety, which is generally preferable to regional action when it makes it possible to achieve sufficiently high levels of protection. Unfortunately, despite enlargement, the European Union’s influence at international level is not commensurate with the size of its fleet and its maritime interests. This situation is due to the fact that the European Union does not have legal status within the IMO. Consequently, the Commission fully agrees with the wish expressed by the European Parliament in its MARE Resolution that the Council should request the Community’s accession to the IMO, as it already proposed in 2002.
Conclusions
The Third Maritime Safety Package rests on a coherent series of measures with many interdependent aspects. It puts into practice the requests made by the European Parliament, the European Council and the ministers meeting within the Transport Council and the Vancouver Interministerial Conference of November 2004 on port State control of ships.
These requests go beyond simply reacting to a particular accident. They seek to bring about a thorough reform of current maritime transport practices and, in the words of the European Parliament in its Resolution of 27 April 2004, they highlight the need for “a comprehensive and cohesive European maritime policy, which would have as its objective the creation of a European maritime safety area”. In addition, this new legislative package, like the earlier packages, will contribute towards achieving the objectives of the Thematic Strategy for the protection of the marine environment required by the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
The measures contained in the third package will contribute to this objective, as part of a comprehensive policy aimed at ensuring efficient, high-quality maritime transport which respects the environment and human beings. The efforts made by the European Union, the national public authorities and the industry to promote a sustainable and economically-viable maritime transport sector will benefit operators which comply with safety standards. The Third Maritime Safety Package sets the level playing field which will fully benefit our maritime industry which contributes to growth and prosperity in Europe.
At a time when the European Union is developing an ambitious policy for the development of motorways of the sea[12], a clear and foreseeable legal framework is needed which enables the investments that are necessary to its development.

Proposal for a
COUNCIL DECISION
on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community, the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway
(presented by the Commission)
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
I. Political and legal background
On 19 January 2001 the European Community concluded an Agreement with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway. Article 12 of that Agreement states that Denmark may request to participate in the Agreement, and that the conditions for such participation are to be determined by the Community, Norway and Iceland, acting with the consent of Denmark, in a Protocol to the Agreement.
Pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark did not take part in the adoption by the Council of Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (“the Dublin II Regulation”) and Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of “Eurodac” for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (“the Eurodac Regulation”). However, Denmark is a party to the Convention determining the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (“the Dublin Convention”), signed in Dublin on 15 June 1990.
On 16 February 2001 Denmark asked to become a party to the agreement between the European Community, Iceland and Norway.
By decision of 6 May 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community, the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway, in accordance with Article 12 of the Agreement.
The negotiations for the conclusion of the Protocol to the Agreement with Norway and Iceland culminated in the initialling of the text on 12 January 2005.
The attached proposals are the legal instruments for signing and concluding the Protocol. With regard to the Community, the legal basis is Article 63(1)(a), taken in conjunction with the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) for the signature decision, and Article 63(1)(a), taken in conjunction with the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) and the first subparagraph of Article 300(3), for the conclusion decision. That means that the Council takes its decision by qualified majority and that the European Parliament is consulted on the conclusion of the Protocol.
II. Results of the negotiations
The Commission takes the view that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been met and that the draft Protocol is acceptable to the Community. The Protocol comprises a total of six articles. It also has an Annex, which forms an integral part of it.
The final contents of the Protocol can be summarised as follows:
- It makes the Dublin II and Eurodac Regulations and their implementing regulations applicable to relations between the Kingdom of Denmark on the one hand and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the other. It also renders future amendments or new implementing measures applicable to these relations.
- It gives Iceland and Norway the right to present written pleadings or observations to the Court of Justice when a court in Denmark applies to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of a provision of the Agreement between the European Community and Denmark.
- It provides for a conciliation mechanism in the event of disagreement between Denmark on the one hand and Iceland or Norway on the other hand on its interpretation or application.
- It lays down provisions relating to the end of its applicability.
III. Conclusions
In the light of the above considerations, the Commission proposes that the Council:
- decide that the Protocol be signed on behalf of the Community and authorise the President of the Council to appoint the person(s) duly empowered to sign on behalf of the Community;
- after consulting the European Parliament, approve the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community, the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway.

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EEC) No 302/93 on the establishment of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction as regards the Director's term of office …
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
1. JUSTIFICATION FOR, AND OBJECTIVE OF, THE PROPOSAL
In the European Union there are now 20 decentralised bodies which can be categorised as Community agencies on account of their common features: establishment on a legal basis, legal personality, administrative and financial autonomy, clearly-defined sphere of responsibility and action, etc.
The head of each Community agency usually has the title director and in some cases is assisted by one or more deputies. The director’s term of office is generally 4-5 years. Most of the basic Regulations nevertheless provide for the director’s term of office and, where applicable, that of the deputies, to be extended for one or more further periods. The conditions governing appointment and term of office are laid down in each basic Regulation for each agency.
Until recently, the body responsible for appointment simply adopted a decision extending an incumbent director’s term of office. Having examined the basic Regulations in more detail, however, the Commission has concluded that this practice poses a legal problem.
Apart from Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 establishing a European Training Foundation and, more recently, Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control, the basic Regulations for the Community agencies use the term “renewal” to refer to extending the director’s term of office.
In the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 214(1) (on appointing Commission Members) and Articles 223 and 225 (on appointing Court of Justice Judges) contain the same provision. Yet in both cases it is agreed that the possibility of renewal does not mean that a simplified procedure is applicable or that the term of office may be extended without complying with the appointment procedure laid down in the Treaty.
Under these conditions, the fact that the term of office is renewable must be interpreted as meaning that, when the term of office ends, the incumbent has to apply for a new term.
Applied to the agencies, this interpretation leads to the conclusion that the possibility of renewing the director’s term of office does not exempt the incumbent from following the appointment procedure laid down in the basic Regulation.
Moreover, agency directors and their deputies are not only office-holders but also agency staff members employed under temporary contracts and subject to the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities.
The appointment procedure must therefore include publication of the post in all Member States and a selection process in compliance with the rules deriving from the basic Regulations and the Conditions of employment of other servants.
These procedures are generally lengthy and relatively expensive. They may also slow up or hamper the agency’s work during this period, if the incumbent director decides to reapply.
Given the agencies’ special needs and the practice in past years, it therefore does not seem appropriate to conduct a full selection procedure each time that the first term of office for a director’s or other relevant person’s post comes to an end. The appointing bodies responsible should have the option of either extending the current term of office or launching a new selection procedure.
Account should likewise be taken of the fact that an agency director is not only an administrative manager but also plays an important role in conducting the agency’s work and achieving its objectives. The appointing authority’s decision must take both these aspects into account: the need to ensure continuity in the agency’s administrative management while at the same time fostering new ideas and policies.
That is why a decision to extend an incumbent director’s term of office must be based on a prior assessment of their performance and of the agency’s needs, conducted by the authority proposing candidates to the appointing authority, and extension may be authorised only once and for a limited period not exceeding that stipulated for the initial term of office.
In total, amendment of the articles relating to appointment is proposed in respect of 18 agencies – resulting in the presentation of 18 proposals for Regulations amending the basic Regulation for each agency.
The Regulations establishing two agencies do not require amendment: Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 of 5 December 2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction[1] and Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency[2]. Because of these agencies’ limited lifespan, these Regulations do not provide for a director’s term of office to be renewed.
Similarly, no proposals have been presented for amendment of the acts setting up agencies and other bodies under the second and third pillars.
Lastly, regarding the two agencies in respect of which a proposal for a Regulation has already been presented and is being examined or is in the process of being adopted (the European Chemicals Agency[3] and the Community Fisheries Control Agency[4]), the Commission will as necessary present proposals for amendments with a view to harmonising the texts for all the Community agencies.
2. LEGAL BASIS AND ADOPTION PROCÉDURE
Each Regulation establishing an agency is in principle based on the Treaty article corresponding to that agency’s sphere of responsibility and action, from which the applicable adoption procedure likewise derives.
That is why it has proved necessary to amend each Regulation establishing an agency.
The procedure for adopting the Regulations should be in accordance with the rules in force when the agency was established, while taking into account any relevant changes which have taken place since the establishing Regulation was adopted – such as European Parliament powers introduced by the Treaty or amendments relating to the legal basis.
This particularly applies in the case of the European Environment Agency, but also in respect of five Regulations whose legal basis has been amended and for which Article 308 of the Treaty has been replaced by the legal basis for those agencies’ sphere of action.
The agencies in question here are: the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (the establishing Regulation is currently being consolidated and the Commission has accepted the Council’s view that from now on Article 152 should be used as the legal basis); the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Article 150); the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Article 137(1)(a) and (b)); the European Training Foundation (Article 150); and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Article 137(1)(a)).
3. WORDING OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS
3.1 The three recitals, which are common to all the proposed Regulations, are worded as follows:
“It is necessary to harmonise the rules on the conditions and procedures applicable to extending the term of office of the Director, Deputy Director or President, as appropriate, of certain Community agencies.
Provision should be made to extend this term of office once, after adequate evaluation.
Regulation ... [title of the basic Regulation establishing the agency] should therefore be amended,”.
3.2 For each of the amended Regulations, the proposed standard wording is:
“The [Agency/Centre/Office/Authority] shall be headed by a Director appointed by the management board* on a proposal from the Commission** for a five-year period which, on a proposal from the Commission** and after evaluation, may be extended once for a period of not more than five years.
In the evaluation the Commission** shall assess in particular:
- the results achieved in the first term of office and the way in which they were achieved;
- the [Agency/Centre/Office/Authority]’s duties and requirements in the coming years.”
* the Council in the case of the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) and the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM); the Commission in the case of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) and the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (EUROFOUND);

Invitation to submit comments pursuant to Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty
(2005/C 14/02)
(Text with EEA relevance)
By means of the letter dated 1 December 2004 reproduced in the authentic language on the pages following this summary, the Commission notified Portugal of its decision to open the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the abovementioned aid
Interested parties may submit their comments on the measures in respect of which the Commission is extending the procedure within one month of the date of publication of this summary and the following letter, to:
European Commission
Directorate-General for Competition
State Aid Greffe

These comments will be communicated to Portugal. Confidential treatment of the identity of the interested party submitting the comments may be requested in writing, stating the reasons for the request.
TEXT OF SUMMARY
The beneficiary, Orfama, Organização Fabril de Malhas S.A. ("Orfama"), produces fashion knitwear, in the north of Portugal. The company acquired two undertakings, Archimode SP and Wartatex SP, located in Lodz, in Poland n order to complement its production line. Portugal has notified the Commission of its intention to provide Orfama with a tax credit of EUR 921.752, corresponding to 10 % of total eligible investment costs in relation to this project.
The Commission has assessed this measure against criteria normally used for aid to large enterprises on foreign direct investment projects. However, the Commission also took into account that Poland being presently a member of the EU (which was not the case at the time the investment was carried out), the impact of the measure on competition within the EU may be greater than in case where the investment takes place in a third country.
In this context, the Commission has doubts on what will be the impact of the aid on employment and other factors for the regions concerned or indeed for the industries at stake in both countries. Both Poland and Portugal are textile producers. The companies concerned, Orfama, Archimode and Wartatex are located in assisted regions in the respective countries. This requires a balancing exercise when assessing the appropriateness of the aid to the Portuguese company. The Commission also questions whether the same project received aid from Poland.
Further, it is doubtful the aid was necessary for the applicant to carry out the investment. The company already had a large experience of working with the Polish companies prior to their acquisition and was therefore familiar with doing business in Poland. Poland's imminent accession to the EU was known at the time the project was carried out and the company therefore knew under which conditions it would operate within the common market. In addition, it appears that the request for aid was filed after the project was completed, thus lacking the "incentive effect" normally required to justify the aid.
Portugal has also not justified whether the project can be considered "initial investment", in the sense of investment in a new company, extension of a previous one or investment in a new production process and, as such, be eligible for aid in conformity with State aid rules.
In the light of the above the Commission cannot conclude at this stage that the aid complies with the conditions normally used for assessing aid on foreign direct investment and thereby with the exemption under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. The Commission has thus decided to open the procedure under Article 88(2) of the Treaty and give interested parties the opportunity to comment.
TEXT OF THE LETTER
"Cumpre à Comissão informar Portugal que, após exame das informações fornecidas pelas Autoridades portuguesas relativas ao auxílio em epígrafe, decidiu dar início ao procedimento previsto no n.o 2 do artigo 88.o do Tratado CE.
1. ASPECTOS PROCESSUAIS
(1) Por carta de 5 de Maio de 2004 (registada em 19 de Maio de 2004), Portugal notificou à Comissão a intenção de conceder um auxílio à Orfama, Organização Fabril de Malhas S.A., no contexto de um investimento realizado por esta empresa na Polónia. A Comissão solicitou informações complementares em 15 de Julho de 2004, tendo as Autoridades portuguesas respondido por carta de 30 de Setembro de 2004 (registada em 5 de Outubro de 2004). O prazo para a adopção de uma decisão pela Comissão termina em 6 de Dezembro de 2004.
2. DESCRIÇÃO DO AUXÍLIO
(2) A empresa beneficiária, Orfama, Organização Fabril de Malhas S.A. ("Orfama"), está situada numa região assistida de Portugal. A empresa produz vestuário em malha, segundo um processo que abrange todas as etapas de produção, desde a tricotagem até à peça de vestuário acabada. Detém 45 % de outro fabricante de vestuário, a "Marrantex", que desenvolve actividades complementares à sua linha de produção. A empresa vende a maior parte dos seus produtos na União Europeia (50 %), Estados Unidos e Canadá (38 %) e Japão (5 %).
(3) O projecto consiste na aquisição de duas empresas têxteis, a Archimode SP e a Wartatex SP, localizadas em Lodz, na Polónia. As duas empresas desenvolvem actividades de produção de malhas. Segundo as informações disponíveis, o investimento foi realizado em 1999.
(4) As Autoridades portuguesas informaram que a Orfama começou a trabalhar com as empresas polacas em 1995, ao abrigo de um regime de subcontratação, representando estas empresas cerca de 30 % do volume de negócios da Orfama. Subsequentemente, a Orfama decidiu adquirir as duas empresas, a fim de consolidar a sua presença na Polónia e nos mercados da Europa Oriental. O projecto fazia igualmente parte de uma estratégia de mudança para produtos de maior valor acrescentado, mantendo-se a empresa competitiva em termos de custos de mão-de-obra.
(5) As Autoridades portuguesas salientaram que este investimento permitirá que a Orfama mantenha a capacidade actualmente instalada em Portugal, sem deslocalização das actividades de Portugal para a Polónia. Por outro lado, as Autoridades portuguesas consideraram que o projecto contribuirá para o reforço da competitividade da indústria têxtil na União Europeia, face à crescente concorrência proveniente dos países asiáticos. A título comparativo, as Autoridades portuguesas referiram que só a China exporta para a União Europeia trinta vezes mais do que importa junto dos produtores da União. É provável que esta tendência seja reforçada com a supressão das quotas de importação da China e de outros países terceiros, em 1 de Janeiro de 2005.
(6) O investimento relativo à aquisição do capital social, mais prémio, das duas empresas elevou-se a 9217516 euros, com a seguinte repartição: 8900205 euros para a Archimode e 317311 euros para a Wartatex. A Orfama financiou 97 % do investimento através de empréstimos bancários e o restante através de fundos próprios.
(7) Portugal notificou ainda à Comissão a intenção de conceder à Orfama um crédito fiscal de 921752 euros, correspondente a 10 % do total dos custos de investimento elegíveis relacionados com o projecto acima referido.
(8) As Autoridades portuguesas informaram que o pedido de auxílio foi apresentado em Março de 2000. O projecto foi realizado pouco antes desta data por razões estratégicas no pressuposto de que seria elegível para beneficiar de auxílios ao abrigo da legislação portuguesa relevante.
(9) As Autoridades portuguesas afirmaram que tencionam conceder à Orfama o "auxílio de minimis" de 100000 euros, caso a Comissão não autorize o montante notificado de 921752 euros. A Comissão salienta, neste contexto, que a concessão, por Portugal, de um auxílio "de minimis" a favor deste projecto está sujeita à condição de o auxílio não dizer respeito a actividades relacionadas com a exportação, em conformidade com as regras "de minimis" comunitárias [1]. A Comissão apreciará este aspecto no contexto do montante total de auxílio notificado.
3. APRECIAÇÃO
Existência de auxílio na acepção do n.o 1 do artigo 87.o do Tratado CE
(10) Nos termos do n.o 1 do artigo 87.o, são "incompatíveis com o mercado comum, na medida em que afectem as trocas comerciais entre os Estados Membros, os auxílios concedidos pelos Estados ou provenientes de recursos estatais independentemente da forma que assumam, que falseiem ou ameacem falsear a concorrência, favorecendo certas empresas ou certas produções".
(11) Ao auxiliar a Orfama a realizar um investimento na Polónia, a medida notificada favorece uma certa empresa ou a produção de certos produtos. O sector em causa, o sector têxtil, é objecto de trocas comerciais na União Europeia. Por conseguinte, o auxílio é susceptível de provocar distorções da concorrência na União Europeia.
(12) O auxílio é financiado através de recursos estatais.
(13) Consequentemente, a Comissão conclui que o auxílio é abrangido pelo âmbito de aplicação do n.o 1 do artigo 87.o do Tratado.
Exigência de notificação
(14) Portugal notificou a actual medida ao abrigo do regime N 96/99, relativo aos auxílios fiscais a favor de projectos de internacionalização, aprovado pela Comissão em 8 de Setembro de 1999 [2]. Este regime autoriza apenas os auxílios ao investimento directo no estrangeiro concedidos a PME e exige que os auxílios concedidos a grandes empresas sejam notificados individualmente, para apreciação numa base casuística.
(15) Uma vez que a Orfama não pode ser considerada uma PME [3], os auxílios concedidos a esta empresa estão sujeitos à obrigação de notificação. Por conseguinte, Portugal deu cumprimento à obrigação que lhe incumbe por força do n.o 3 do artigo 88.o do Tratado.
Compatibilidade do auxílio com o Tratado CE
(16) Regra geral, os auxílios ao investimento a grandes empresas são considerados incompatíveis com o mercado comum, salvo se puderem ser justificados através de uma das derrogações previstas nos n.os 2 ou 3 do artigo 87.o do Tratado.
(17) Não existem orientações específicas que possam ser utilizadas como referência para a apreciação da presente medida. Normalmente, apenas as orientações relativas aos auxílios estatais com finalidade regional podem servir como base para autorizar auxílios ao investimento a grandes empresas na Comunidade. Contudo, considera-se que no presente caso as regras não permitiam que Portugal concedesse, a uma empresa portuguesa, auxílios regionais destinados a um investimento na Polónia [4].
(18) Portugal notificou a presente medida ao abrigo do regime N 96/99 porque considerou que a medida favorecia a internacionalização da empresa em causa. As Autoridades portuguesas salientaram neste contexto que o momento em que foi realizado o investimento, ou seja, antes da adesão da Polónia à União Europeia, constituía um elemento relevante para a apreciação da medida.
(19) Consequentemente, a Comissão apreciou o presente caso tendo em conta os critérios normalmente utilizados para apreciar os auxílios a favor de grandes empresas destinados a projectos de investimento directo no estrangeiro. Contudo, ao fazê-lo, a Comissão tomou igualmente em consideração o facto de a Polónia ser actualmente membro da União Europeia, uma vez que o impacto da medida sobre a concorrência na União Europeia pode ser mais importante do que aconteceria com um investimento realizado num país terceiro. Além disso, a Comissão reconhece que, tendo em conta a sua especificidade, podem existir outros elementos relevantes para a apreciação do presente caso.
Condições para a apreciação dos auxílios relacionados com o investimento directo no estrangeiro
(20) Até ao momento, a Comissão apenas aprovou um caso de auxílio a uma grande empresa no âmbito de um projecto de investimento directo no estrangeiro [5]. Dizia respeito ao investimento de uma empresa portuguesa no Brasil. A Comissão concluiu que o auxílio promovia a internacionalização da empresa em causa e que o impacto do auxílio sobre o mercado comum seria reduzido, satisfazendo assim as condições necessárias para beneficiar de uma isenção nos termos do n.o 3, alínea c), do artigo 87.o do Tratado.
(21) Em situações deste tipo, a Comissão pondera normalmente os benefícios da medida, em termos da sua contribuição para a competitividade internacional da indústria da União Europeia em causa, face aos eventuais efeitos negativos na Comunidade, como os riscos de deslocalização e os possíveis efeitos prejudiciais em matéria de emprego. A Comissão toma igualmente em consideração a necessidade do auxílio, utilizando como referência os riscos que o projecto implica face ao país que acolhe o investimento e também as carências da empresa, como as registadas pelas PME. A Comissão examina o impacto sectorial e o conteúdo local. Um outro critério diz respeito a um eventual impacto regional positivo. Por último, a Comissão exclui todos os auxílios a actividades relacionadas com a exportação.
(22) No presente caso, o auxílio destina-se a investimentos de carácter produtivo. Por conseguinte, não se destina a actividades relacionadas com a exportação [6].
(23) No que se refere a outras condições, as Autoridades portuguesas salientaram que embora o investimento seja efectuado dentro da União Europeia, contribui para o reforço dos laços económicos com os mercados da Europa Oriental. Além disso, terá um impacto positivo tanto na região onde se situa o requerente do auxílio, como na região polaca que acolhe o investimento, uma vez que contribuirá para a manutenção do emprego em ambas as regiões, sem os efeitos inerentes à deslocalização. O auxílio beneficiaria toda a indústria têxtil da Comunidade e torná-la-ia mais competitiva face aos mercados externos.
Dúvidas no presente caso
(24) A Comissão salienta que uma vez que o investimento é efectuado dentro do mercado comum, é provável que o impacto do auxílio sobre o comércio intracomunitário seja mais significativo do que aconteceria com um auxílio destinado a um projecto num país terceiro. Nesta última situação, caso o produto fosse exportado para a União Europeia, estaria sujeito às restrições à importação aplicáveis (por exemplo, medidas pautais), enquanto os produtos da Comunidade beneficiam das condições aplicáveis ao mercado interno.
(25) As Autoridades portuguesas não forneceram dados suficientes sobre o impacto no emprego e noutros factores das regiões em causa, ou mesmo nas indústrias afectadas em ambos os Estados-Membros. Tanto a Polónia como Portugal são produtores de têxteis. As empresas em causa, a Orfama, a Archimode e a Wartatex estão situadas em regiões assistidas dos respectivos países. Tal implica um exercício de ponderação, para determinar se o auxílio à empresa portuguesa é adequado. A Comissão tem ainda dúvidas, neste contexto, quanto à possibilidade de o mesmo projecto ter recebido auxílios da Polónia.
(26) Existem dúvidas quanto ao facto de a requerente necessitar do auxílio para realizar o investimento. A empresa tinha já uma ampla experiência de trabalho com as empresas polacas antes da sua aquisição, estando assim familiarizada com o mundo empresarial polaco. A adesão próxima da Polónia à União Europeia era do conhecimento geral no momento em que o projecto foi levado a cabo e, por conseguinte, a empresa sabia em que condições iria desenvolver as suas actividades no mercado comum.
(27) Acresce ainda que, aparentemente, o pedido de auxílio foi apresentado após a realização do projecto, o que lhe retira o "efeito de incentivo" [7] normalmente exigido para justificar a concessão de um auxílio.
(28) As Autoridades portuguesas não informaram se o projecto deve ser considerado um "investimento inicial" — ou seja, investimento numa nova empresa, extensão de uma empresa existente ou alteração do processo de produção - e, enquanto tal, elegível para beneficiar de auxílios em conformidade com as regras em matéria de auxílios estatais [8].
(29) À luz do que precede, a Comissão não pode concluir, na presente fase, que o auxílio satisfaz as condições normalmente utilizadas para apreciar os auxílios ao investimento directo no estrangeiro nem, por conseguinte, as condições da isenção prevista no n.o 3, da alínea c), do artigo 87.o do Tratado. A Comissão convida as Autoridades portuguesas a apresentarem quaisquer elementos complementares que possam ser relevantes no âmbito do presente caso. A presente decisão não prejudica a aplicação, por parte de Portugal, do Regulamento (CE) n.o 69/2001, uma vez que o auxílio não está ligado a actividades relacionadas com a exportação.
4. DECISÃO
(30) À luz das considerações precedentes, a Comissão decidiu dar início ao procedimento previsto no n.o 2 do artigo 88.o do Tratado CE, no que se refere ao auxílio notificado a favor da Orfama, Organização Fabril de Malhas S.A., visto que tem dúvidas quanto à sua compatibilidade com o mercado comum.
(31) A Comissão solicita que Portugal lhe apresente as suas observações e lhe forneça quaisquer informações relevantes para a apreciação do auxílio no prazo de um mês a contar da data de recepção da presente carta. A Comissão solicita que as Autoridades portuguesas enviem, de imediato, uma cópia da presente carta ao beneficiário potencial do auxílio.
(32) A Comissão recorda às Autoridades portuguesas o efeito suspensivo do n.o 3 do artigo 88.o do Tratado CE e remete para o artigo 14.o do Regulamento (CE) n.o 659/1999 do Conselho, segundo o qual qualquer auxílio concedido ilegalmente pode ser objecto de recuperação junto do beneficiário."

Esta disposição, aplicável na altura em que o auxílio foi concedido pelas Autoridades portuguesas, aplica-se apenas, claramente, aos auxílios concedidos pela Polónia e exclui os auxílios concedidos por qualquer outro Estado-Membro a favor de investimentos das suas empresas na Polónia.

[8] No ponto 4.4. das "Orientações relativas aos auxílios estatais com finalidade regional, o investimento inicial é definido como "um investimento em capital fixo para a criação de um novo estabelecimento, a extensão de um estabelecimento existente ou o arranque de uma actividade que implique uma alteração fundamental do produto ou do processo de produção de um estabelecimento existente (através da racionalização, diversificação ou modernização). As Autoridades portuguesas não forneceram elementos que comprovassem que qualquer destas condições se encontra preenchida.

3. Type of product:
Extra virgin olive oil. Class 1.5.- Oils and fats (butter, margarine, oil, etc.).
4. Specification:
(Summary of requirements under Article 4(2))
Name: "Aceite de La Rioja"
Description:
Product obtained from the fruit of the olive tree (olives) using exclusively mechanical methods or procedures, including pressing, in conditions which, particularly as regards heat, do not alter the nature of the oil or its excellent taste and free fatty acid content expressed as oleic acid of not more than 0,8 grams per 100, excluding oils obtained using solvents or by reesterification and any mixing with oils of other types or olive oil obtained by different methods.
The protected oils are extra virgin olive oils, clear in appearance, with no cloudiness, turbidity or dirt which detracts from their transparency. They are green in colour, with lights which may range from intense light green to intense dark green. They have no defects and sufficiently marked positive features. Their taste is fruity early in the season, with hints of almond, no bitterness, sweet and slightly savoury.
Once it has matured, La Rioja olive oil has the following physical and chemical characteristics: Acidity not exceeding 0,8, ultraviolet absorption (K270) not exceeding 0,20, ultraviolet absorption (K232), not exceeding 2,50, peroxide index mEq O2 not exceeding 15, humidity and volatile mater when heated to 105 °C not exceeding 0,1 per 100, impurities insoluble in petroleum ether not exceeding 0,1 per 100, average organoleptic defect evaluation (Md), Md = 0 and average organoleptic evaluation of fruitiness (Mf), Mf &lt; 0.
Geographical area: The area of production corresponds to that of conservation, extraction and packaging and covers the 503388 ha of the Autonomous Community of La Rioja.
Proof of origin:
Holdings and/or plantations, oil mills and packaging plants located in the designated area from which the raw material is derived and where it is processed must be entered in the corresponding registers of the "Asolrioja" Association.
These holdings and/or plantations, oil mills and/or packaging plants must also have their own self-inspection system and be subject to outside checks by the I.C.A.R. and/or an outside inspection body under contract to the "Asolrioja" Association, which will ensure recognition by the relevant authority (Department of agriculture, livestock raising and rural development of the Government of La Rioja) of compliance with standard UNE EN 45.004, providing impartial checks that the protected extra virgin olive oil meets the requirements set out in the Regulation and the specification.
Each holding and/or plantation, oil mill and/or packaging plant must apply to the Association for entry in the "Control plan" and the I.C.A.R and/or the authorised outside inspection body evaluates it by means of a registration audit. If this is satisfactory, the body concerned may be entered in the corresponding register of the Association, which will ensure that it is continuously updated. Subsequently, the I.C.A.R. and/or the outside inspection body draws up an "Audit plan" leading to a report to be evaluated by the Food Quality Institute. If its decision is favourable, Product certification is granted, ensuring that only extra virgin olive oil which has passed all the checks provided for will be marketed. There is also a Coordination Council to ensure the impartiality of both the Association itself and of the I.C.A.R and/or the authorised outside inspection body.
The traceability of the product is guaranteed by its identification at each of the stages of production and marketing.
Method of production:
The state of health of the fruit, the date of harvesting and the increasingly modern processing techniques mean that the area of production boasts a good quality of fruit and so the oil obtained from it. The productivity and shade density of the olive tree will be appropriate to the state of growth of the plantation. Harvesting is always carried out carefully, with the sole aim of producing the protected oils from healthy fruit collected direct from the tree and of an appropriate degree of ripeness.
All the mills and/or packaging plants have systems to guarantee the separate unloading of fruit intended for the preparation of La Rioja extra virgin olive oil or of that oil and the rest, so avoiding any possible mixing. They also have appropriate areas for storing the olives or the protected oil before it handling. The olives are milled within no more than 48 hours of harvesting, so preventing them from rotting and becoming more acid. The temperature during extraction never exceeds 30 °C during pressing and 45 °C during the centrifugation process.
Pressing time never exceeds 60 minutes and the temperature never exceeds 30 °C; there is only one pressing cycle.
La Rioja extra virgin olive oil is never refined.
The protected oil is stored in conditions which guarantee its conservation, preferably in stainless steel vats, presses or metal tanks lined with ceramic, epoxy resins or other food-grade inert material. These tanks are hermetically sealed and kept at a gentle and constant storage temperature never exceeding 22 °C.
The olive oil is packaged only if it has the physical and chemical characteristics listed under 4.2 and passes a taste test set by a Grading Committee.
To preserve the quality and ensure the traceability and inspection of the protected product, all the processes of production, reception, processing and packaging take place in the designated geographical area.
Link:
Historic link: Olive oil, now a key element of the Mediterranean diet, has been a basic food in La Rioja, as well as being used for poultices and as rubbing oil, collected by the faithful for use in lamps in shrines and consumed or rubbed on painful spots while invoking virgins. For years olives preserved and prepared in the houses of farmers in La Rioja have served as an aperitif and a good snack when kept in cold water with salt, thyme, garlic and orange peel.
However, the Romans were the first to extract olive oil by pressing in La Rioja. An indication of this is the Roman counterweight found at Murillo de Río Leza and the oil store at a mill site in Alfaro, where two large oil stains may be seen.
There are written references to olive cultivation in the Province in the eighteenth century, as the only well-ordered crop, and to mills for processing, of which there were 42 in La Rioja, which fell to 39 in 1861, rose to 64 in 1945 and then in 1953 to 81 mills, one residue mills, four factories producing industrial soap and six producing ordinary soap, all of which used olive oil. In that century Berceo notes that oil from La Rioja was being exported to the Indies and northern Europe.
Madoz's "Diccionario Geográfico Estadístico Histórico de España y sus Posesiones de Ultramar" (Historical statistical dictionary of Spain and its overseas possessions), mentions the importance of oil exports from Alfaro in 1846-50.
Natural factors: Olive trees in La Rioja are normally to be found on dry soils with little humus in their upper layers, rich in lime, clay and sand and with no impermeable layers, so having good drainage, limiting growth, particularly in the hot season, and so a correct hormonal balance which affects the future quality of the olives produced here by increasing the content of the fruit in oil, polyphenols, anthocyanins and aromas and lowering pH, malic acid, potassium and grassy flavours. A more fertile type of soil would result in excessive growth and, worse, growth spilling over into the period when the olives are ripening, so delaying ripening and preventing adequate maturing. There would also be more shade problems because of the greater density of foliage and abundance of vegetation and more fungal diseases resulting in lower quality.
The predominant climate in the protected geographical area, temperate Mediterranean with some continental features, mild winters, long hot summers and low rainfall which is, however, sufficient for this crop to grow correctly in drought, good light and slight fluctuations in temperature between day and night, is ideal for development of the olive tree, resulting in increased oil content, better aroma and lower total acidity.
The low winter temperatures at cold times, which are also necessary to ensure the subsequent flowering and fruiting of the tree, occur when it is in its state of vegetative rest with no leaves or fruit, a time when it can resist temperatures down to -10 °C. After its winter rest, the olive requires light and temperatures between 10 °C and 25 °C to develop correctly. The Mediterranean climate in the designated area provides adequate light and warmth but is not so fierce as to prevent photosynthesis and loss of leaves where evaporation from them cannot be compensated for from the roots.
The thermal gap which occurs only during maturation has a positive influence on the synthesis of anthocyanins.
Another factor which is also very important in securing a good harvest and so good oil is the olive grower, who adds care to all the region's natural assets. The olive growers in the area have considerable knowledge of the olive tree and use traditional cultivation techniques designed to result in a balanced grove perfectly designed to produce quality olive oil.

SUMMARY
Procedure
In November 2004, Essent, a cable operator, filed a complaint with the Commission concerning the public funding of a fibre access network in Appingedam, the Netherlands. Essent had already lodged an appeal with a Dutch court in September 2004. The court ordered the municipality to notify the plans to grant aid to the Commission and to suspend the further roll-out of the network [1]. In February 2005, the Dutch authorities notified the measure to the Commission claiming that it did not constitute aid. The Commission requested further information from the Dutch authorities in March 2005. The authorities replied in August 2005, after an extension of the deadline.
Description of the measure
The municipality of Appingedam considers that public intervention is needed to address the non-pervasive supply of advanced broadband services to companies and citizens by supporting the deployment of a glass fibre access network (Fibre to the Home, FttH). The municipality decided to participate financially in the project after market players showed no interest in participating in this project on market terms.
The planned fibre network is split into a passive and an active layer. The passive layer will be owned by a public foundation set up and controlled by the municipality. The active layer will be owned and financed by an entity set up by private investors (%quot%Damsternet%quot%). Damsternet itself will only offer wholesale services to service providers who will provide broadband services to end users (households and businesses).
Assessment of the measure:
State resources are involved since the funds for the passive layer of this network come from the municipality of Appingedam. An economic advantage is granted — to the foundation, Damsternet and the retail service providers — since they will provide and have access to infrastructure under circumstances which are more favourable than market terms. The intervention of the State distorts competition as this measure alters the existing market conditions by enabling entry into the wholesale market for fast broadband services (Damsternet) as well as allowing service providers to enter the downstream markets of retail broadband and telecommunications services. Since the intervention is liable to affect providers of electronic communications services from other Member States, the measure has an effect on trade.
It seems that any compatibility assessment can only be based on Article 87(3)(c) EC Treaty. This requires the measure to pursue in a necessary and proportionate way an objective of common interest, i.e. the correction of a market failure or the pursuit of an accepted cohesion/redistribution goal.
Necessity and proportionality
Broadband connectivity is the type of service that, by its nature, is capable of affecting productivity and growth of an economy. In other cases, the Commission has considered that aid to infrastructure could be an appropriate and proportionate instrument for tackling market failures and/or equity problems. Indeed, this project has some of the characteristics which were assessed positively in previous Commission decisions concerning the public funding of broadband projects (open tender, open access, etc.). In addition, since the technical characteristics of FttH networks allow the provision of more advanced services than those provided over traditional copper or cable networks [2], it could be argued that State aid could be a desirable means of accelerating the pace of innovation, even at the cost of undermining past private sector investment and discouraging future private sector investment.
The Commission has so far only approved cases in which the market did not support the competitive supply of broadband services. The intervention in this case takes place in an area where retail broadband services (KPN and Essent) and, to a certain extent, wholesale infrastructure to provide broadband services (KPN) are already available at prices comparable to other regions. There is an important overlap of network coverage and terms of services with existing networks and hence a serious risk that State intervention in such an area crowds out existing and future investment by market players.
In view of the above, the Commission has decided to initiate the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty on the disputed measure because the Commission is not persuaded that the measure is compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty.
In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, all unlawful aid can be subject to recovery from the recipient.
TEXT OF LETTER
%quot%Met dit schrijven stelt de Commissie Nederland ervan in kennis dat zij, na onderzoek van de door uw autoriteiten verstrekte inlichtingen betreffende bovengenoemde steunmaatregel, heeft besloten de procedure van artikel 88, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag in te leiden.
I. Procedure
1. Bij schrijven van 2 november 2004 (dat op 18 november 2004 geregistreerd werd onder nummer CP 212/2004) diende kabelexploitant Essent Kabelcom (hierna: Essent), een informele klacht in bij de Commissie. De klacht betreft overheidsfinanciering voor een glasvezelaansluitnetwerk (Fibre-to-the-Home, FTTH) in Appingedam, een stad in Noord-Nederland. Essent heeft intussen bevestigd dat de klacht als een formele klacht dient te worden beschouwd.
2. Essent, die de op een na grootste kabelexploitant van Nederland is en die ook een kabelnetwerk in Appingedam exploiteert, had de zaak in september 2004 al aanhangig gemaakt bij een Nederlandse rechtbank. De rechtbank heeft de gemeente op grond van artikel 88, lid 3, EG-Verdrag opgedragen het steunvoornemen aan te melden bij de Commissie en de verdere aanleg van het netwerk te staken.
3. Bij een schrijven dat op 3 februari 2005 werd geregistreerd, meldden de Nederlandse autoriteiten de maatregel bij de Commissie aan om redenen van rechtszekerheid, waarbij ze aanvoerden dat de maatregel geen steun behelsde. Op 31 maart 2005 verzocht de Commissie de Nederlandse autoriteiten om verdere informatie. Na een verlenging van de termijn antwoordden zij hierop bij brief van 4 augustus 2005, die op 16 augustus 2005 werd geregistreerd. De informatie in deze brief verschilt aanzienlijk van de informatie die bij de oorspronkelijke aanmelding werd verstrekt.
II. Uitvoerige beschrijving van de maatregel
Achtergrond
4. De gemeente Appingedam vindt dat de tussenkomst van de overheid nodig is om te voorzien in de algemene beschikbaarheid van geavanceerde breedbanddiensten voor ondernemingen en particulieren door uitrol van een glasvezelaansluitnetwerk (Fibre-to-the-Home, FTTH) in Appingedam te steunen. Volgens de gemeente bieden Essent en telecommunicatie-exploitant KPN in Appingedam weliswaar internettoegang maar geen geavanceerde breedbanddiensten. De gemeente heeft besloten financieel deel te nemen in het project nadat gebleken was dat de marktpartijen geen belangstelling hadden om hierin op marktvoorwaarden deel te nemen.
De componenten van het netwerk
5. De passieve laag van het glasvezelnetwerk (graafrechten, buizen, glasvezels, enz.) zal het eigendom worden van een openbare stichting (%quot%Stichting Glasvezelnet Appingedam%quot%, hierna: de stichting), op te richten door en onder toezicht van de gemeente. De investering in de passieve laag wordt op 4,9 miljoen EUR geschat. Aanvankelijk was niet voorzien dat de aanleg van de passieve laag openbaar zou worden aanbesteed. Er is evenwel besloten, zoals in de brief van 4 augustus 2005 wordt verklaard, om dit wel te doen.
6. De kosten van de actieve laag (telecommunicatieapparatuur, netwerkbeheer, enz.) worden op 1 tot 1,3 miljoen EUR geschat. De actieve componenten hebben een geschatte economische levensduur van 5 tot 8 jaar. De exploitant van de actieve laag zal alleen wholesale-diensten aanbieden aan service providers die breedbanddiensten aan de eindgebruikers (huishoudens en bedrijven) zullen verstrekken.
7. De autoriteiten verklaarden aanvankelijk dat de actieve laag eigendom zou worden van en gefinancierd zou worden door een entiteit (%quot%Stichting Damsternet%quot%, hierna: Damsternet) die door bepaalde particuliere investeerders zou worden opgericht. Niet alle particuliere partijen waren bekend. Volgens de autoriteiten hebben NKF (een kabelfabrikant), Nacap (de pijpleidingdivisie van een internationaal actieve bouwonderneming, genaamd Koop Holding) en Ericsson Telecommunications belangstelling getoond. In de brief van 4 augustus 2005 hebben de autoriteiten evenwel verklaard dat de gemeente het gebruiksrecht van het actieve netwerk uiteindelijk openbaar zou aanbesteden. In dit stadium is het bovendien niet duidelijk op basis van welke financiële voorwaarden het gebruiksrecht zou worden gegund. In de concept-gebruiksovereenkomst wordt bepaald dat de houder van het gebruiksrecht jaarlijks een gebruiksvergoeding aan de stichting zal betalen. De stichting zal echter %quot%maximaal een bedrag opeisen dat overeenkomt met 80 % van de in dat jaar gegenereerde cashflow%quot%. Indien deze cashflow negatief is, zal de stichting geen vergoeding opeisen. In een dergelijk geval zullen zij slechts een minimale betaling verlangen, zoals aangegeven in een bijlage bij de gebruiksovereenkomst. In de bijlage wordt evenwel nog niet bepaald welke betaling voorzien is.
III. Het standpunt van de Nederlandse autoriteiten
8. De Nederlandse autoriteiten stellen dat er geen sprake is van een steunmaatregel en voeren hiervoor verschillende argumenten aan.
9. Allereerst beroepen zij zich op een %quot%marktfalen%quot%, d.w.z. dat de markt niet de diensten verschaft die door de autoriteiten essentieel worden geacht voor de bevolking. Marktinvesteerders zijn niet bereid om in het project te investeren omdat het geen marktconform financieel rendement zou opleveren. Doordat de markt niet in het project investeert, ziet Appingedam zich genoodzaakt dit glasvezelnetwerk aan te leggen als een %quot%publieke infrastructuur%quot%. De Nederlandse autoriteiten voeren daarom aan dat de gemeente Appingedam enkel steun verleent voor de aanleg van een %quot%publieke infrastructuur%quot% die voor alle partijen openstaat op vergelijkbare voorwaarden.
10. In de tweede plaats betogen de autoriteiten dat er geen steun gemoeid is met dit project op de vier niveaus die daarbij kunnen worden onderscheiden. Er is geen sprake van een voordeel voor de stichting en zelfs wanneer dat het geval zou zijn, zou dat niet van invloed zijn op het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten. Er wordt ook geen steun verleend aan de exploitant van de actieve laag. De Commissie merkt op dat de autoriteiten evenwel geen argumenten aanvoeren om deze beweringen te staven. Voorts zijn de autoriteiten van mening dat er geen steun wordt verleend aan de dienstenaanbieders. De exploitant zou een marktconforme wholesale-prijs moeten aanrekenen aan de providers die retail-diensten aanbieden die zij reeds via bestaande infrastructuur aanboden. Indien de Commissie garanties van de gemeente zou verlangen dat de exploitant marktconforme prijzen aanrekent, zal de gemeente dit vastleggen in de overeenkomst tussen de stichting en de exploitant. Tenslotte betogen de autoriteiten dat, in tegenstelling tot de zaak ATLAS [3], het netwerk in Appingedam hoofdzakelijk zou worden gebruikt om diensten te verlenen aan huishoudens/particulieren die geen economische activiteiten verrichten. Voorzover er sprake is van steun aan ondernemingen in Appingedam, blijft deze onder de toegestane steunintensiteit die is vastgelegd in Verordening (EG) nr. 69/2001 (%quot%de minimis-steun%quot%) en bovendien valt deze onder de kaderregeling voor steun aan kleine en middelgrote ondernemingen (MKB).
11. De Nederlandse autoriteiten betogen dat indien de Commissie tot de conclusie komt dat de maatregel steun vormt, de maatregel verenigbaar is omdat deze zowel noodzakelijk als evenredig is. De maatregel is nodig omdat particuliere investeerders niet willen investeren in Appingedam, een perifeer gebied met een sociaal-economische achterstand. Voor zover er breedbanddiensten beschikbaar zijn, zijn de huidige prijzen ervan hoger dan in andere gebieden van Nederland. Aangezien alle exploitanten open toegang tot het netwerk zullen krijgen op gelijke voorwaarden, is de mededinging gewaarborgd en zal geen enkele exploitant een selectief voordeel genieten. De autoriteiten stellen ook dat de maatregel evenredig is. De stichting is niet betrokken bij de exploitatie van de actieve laag. De operator zal een niet-discriminerende, open toegang bieden en niet met dienstenaanbieders concurreren. De aanleg van het netwerk zal plaatsvinden op marktvoorwaarden.
IV. Beoordeling van de maatregel/steun
12. Op grond van het Verdrag en geconsolideerde rechtspraak is er sprake van staatssteun in de zin van artikel 87, lid 1, wanneer door overheidsbemoeienis of door met staatsmiddelen bekostigde maatregelen een voordeel wordt verleend aan de begunstigde, welke de mededinging vervalst of dreigt te vervalsen en het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten ongunstig dreigt te beïnvloeden.

13. De gemeente Appingedam zal ofwel een lening ofwel een garantie voor een lening verstrekken. Bijgevolg zijn de middelen voor de financiering van de passieve laag van dit netwerk afkomstig van de gemeente Appingedam. Deze middelen moeten daarom als staatsmiddelen worden beschouwd.
Economisch voordeel
14. De autoriteiten hebben verschillende argumenten aangevoerd als zou de maatregel geen steun behelzen, ofwel omdat deze geen voordeel meebrengt ofwel omdat deze niet van invloed is op het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten. Op deze argumenten zal hierna worden ingegaan.
15. Volgens de Nederlandse autoriteiten valt een dergelijke vorm van overheidsbemoeienis niet onder artikel 87, lid 1, EG-Verdrag, maar dient deze veeleer te worden gezien als een typische overheidstaak, aangezien algemene infrastructuur wordt aangelegd.
16. De Commissie is echter niet overtuigd dat dit project kan worden beschouwd als het verschaffen van een algemene infrastructuur. Overeenkomstig de bevindingen van de Commissie in de zaak ATLAS [4] bieden het passieve netwerk en de actieve componenten geen dienst aan eindgebruikers, maar voorzieningen voor bedrijven die breedbanddiensten aanbieden. Zoals uit de aanwezigheid van KPN en Essent in Appingedam blijkt, is het verschaffen van dit soort infrastructuur geen typische overheidstaak, maar een activiteit die gewoonlijk wordt verricht door marktpartijen die de uiteindelijke dienst aan huishoudens en bedrijven verstrekken. Het project overlapt daarmee tot op zekere hoogte marktinitiatieven of voorziet in de verstrekking van diensten die al beschikbaar zijn, hoewel de door de stichting aan te leggen infrastructuur graafwerkzaamheden en passieve elementen behelst. De Commissie is derhalve in dit stadium van mening dat het project in Appingedam onder de staatssteunregels valt en niet als algemene infrastructuur kan worden aangemerkt die tot de gewone verantwoordelijkheden van de staat jegens de bevolking behoort.
Voordeel voor de stichting
17. De stichting die eigenaar is van de passieve infrastructuur, is opgericht door de gemeente en staat onder haar toezicht. De stichting stelt de passieve laag ter beschikking van de exploitant. Dit kan als een economische activiteit worden beschouwd en de stichting kan derhalve worden aangemerkt als een onderneming in de zin van artikel 87, lid 1, EG-Verdrag. De passieve laag wordt door de gemeente gefinancierd zonder enige vergoeding van de stichting. Dit komt neer op een economisch voordeel voor de stichting in de zin van artikel 87, lid 1, EG-Verdrag.
Voordeel voor de exploitant
18. De bewering dat er geen steun wordt verleend aan de exploitant, wordt niet door de autoriteiten gestaafd.
19. De autoriteiten hebben bevestigd dat het gebruiksrecht openbaar zal worden aanbesteed. Indien dat gebeurt, kan de aanbesteding in principe het economische voordeel voor de winnende leverancier tot een minimum worden beperkt in de zin van artikel 87, lid 1, EG-Verdrag. Het valt evenwel te betwijfelen of de passieve laag op dezelfde voorwaarden zal worden aangelegd als bij een particuliere investering. Volgens de autoriteiten kon het project niet door particuliere investeerders worden uitgevoerd en waren banken evenmin bereid om geld te steken in dit project. De gemeente heeft verschillende banken gevraagd om dit project te financieren, maar met uitzondering van de Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG) hebben zij dit allemaal geweigerd. BNG is bereid de gemeente een lening te verstrekken omdat zij, aldus de gemeente, alleen de kredietwaardigheid van de begunstigde van de lening, in casu de gemeente, maar niet de aanleg van het FTTH-netwerk door de stichting of het project als zodanig heeft beoordeeld.
Voordeel voor internetaanbieders (ISP's) en andere aanbieders van elektronische communicatiediensten
20. Zelfs wanneer de toegang tot het optische netwerk via de exploitant op transparante en gelijke voorwaarden aan alle geïnteresseerde ISP's en andere exploitanten zal worden verleend, zal de tarifering van deze toegang waarschijnlijk ruim onder de onderliggende kosten liggen als gevolg van de overheidsbemoeienis en niet gebaseerd zijn op de markttarieven voor vergelijkbare wholesale-breedbanddiensten. De dienstenaanbieders zal daarom een voordeel worden verleend aangezien zij de kans krijgen om tot de markt voor snelle retail-breedbanddiensten toe te treden en bedrijfsactiviteiten te ontwikkelen tegen voorwaarden die anders niet op de markt kunnen worden verkregen.
Voordeel voor de eindgebruikers
21. Het voorgaande suggereert dat het voordeel dat aan de exploitant, dienstenaanbieders en andere aanbieders van telecommunicatiediensten wordt verleend, zich ook zou kunnen vertalen in een voordeel voor de huishoudens en ondernemingen in Appingedam. Particuliere gebruikers vallen niet onder de staatssteunregels. Echter ondernemingen in het beoogde gebied zouden wellicht kunnen profiteren van een dienstverlening die verder reikt en lager geprijsd is dan wat op louter commerciële basis zou worden aangeboden gezien de huidige aanbiedingen voor huurlijnen en satellietverbindingen. Bovendien zouden zij een voordeel kunnen genieten in vergelijking met bedrijven in andere regio's van Nederland. De autoriteiten hebben bij herhaling aangevoerd dat, indien er sprake is van steun voor ondernemingen in Appingedam, het steunniveau onder de toegestane steunintensiteit ligt, zoals bepaald bij Verordening (EG) nr. 69/2001 (%quot%de minimis-steun%quot%), en dat de maatregel bovendien onder de kaderregeling inzake overheidssteun voor kleine en middelgrote ondernemingen (KMO's) valt. De Commissie erkent dat het voordeel voor elk van de zakelijke eindgebruikers onder de drempel voor de minimis-steun zou kunnen liggen. Er kan in dit stadium echter niet worden uitgesloten dat de steun wel de in deze verordening vastgelegde plafonds overschrijdt.
Concurrentievervalsing
22. Door deze tussenkomst van de overheid worden de bestaande marktvoorwaarden in Appingedam gewijzigd doordat de gesubsidieerde toegang van de exploitant tot de wholesale-markt voor snelle breedbanddiensten alsmede de toegang van dienstenaanbieders tot de downstream-markten van onder andere retail-breedband- en retail-telecommunicatiediensten mogelijk wordt gemaakt. De bestaande exploitanten, Essent en KPN, hebben bij hun beslissingen inzake infrastructuurinvesteringen en -onderhoud, hun berekeningen gebaseerd op de veronderstelling dat andere exploitanten de kosten van nieuwe infrastructuur zouden moeten dragen of een marktprijs zouden moeten betalen voor de toegang tot wholesale-diensten, hetgeen niet langer het geval lijkt te zijn als er overheidssteun wordt verleend. Het feit dat er nieuwe infrastructuur beschikbaar komt tegen voorwaarden die op het eerste gezicht niet marktconform zijn, heeft tot gevolg dat de concurrentie wordt vervalst, ook op de downstream-markten van retail-breedband- en andere retail-elektronische communicatiediensten.
Gevolgen voor het handelsverkeer
23. Voor zover de overheidsmaatregelen gevolgen kunnen hebben voor telecommunicatiebedrijven en dienstenaanbieders in andere lidstaten, zijn deze van invloed op het handelsverkeer. De telecommunicatiemarkt staat steeds meer open voor concurrentie tussen exploitanten en dienstenaanbieders, die zich over het algemeen bezighouden met activiteiten waarvoor handelsverkeer bestaat tussen de lidstaten.
Conclusie
24. In het licht van het voorgaande is de Commissie van mening dat het met staatsmiddelen gefinancierde project een economisch voordeel verleent aan de stichting, de exploitant en de dienstenaanbieders, hetgeen zich tenminste ten dele zou kunnen vertalen in een economisch voordeel voor ondernemingen in Appingedam. Voorts is het project concurrentievervalsend en van invloed op het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten.
V. Beoordeling van de steunmaatregel: verenigbaarheid
25. Na de vaststelling dat er sprake is van staatssteun in de zin van artikel 87, lid 1, van het EG-Verdrag, dient te worden nagegaan of de maatregel verenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt kan worden geacht.
26. Wanneer staatsmiddelen enkel worden verleend ter compensatie van de verstrekking van een dienst van algemeen economisch belang (hierna: DAEB), dan hoeft hiermee geen staatssteun te zijn gemoeid. Het Hof van Justitie heeft te kennen gegeven dat de compensatie van kosten die voortvloeien uit openbare dienstverplichtingen, niet onder de werkingssfeer van artikel 87, lid 1, van het Verdrag vallen indien aan een aantal voorwaarden is voldaan. Deze voorwaarden worden beschreven in het Altmark-arrest van 24 juli 2003 [5]. De autoriteiten hebben zich evenwel niet beroepen op de voorwaarden die zijn vastgelegd in het Altmark-arrest en hebben evenmin het bestaan van een DAEB aangevoerd, zelfs niet impliciet. Er zijn geen aanwijzingen dat de overheidsmaatregel moet worden beschouwd als compensatie voor de diensten die door de begunstigde ondernemingen worden verstrekt. Daarom heeft de Commissie in dit stadium de aangemelde maatregel niet bezien tegen deze achtergrond of getoetst aan het bepaalde in artikel 86, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag.
27. De Commissie merkt op dat met het voorgenomen project wordt beoogd de ruime beschikbaarheid en het ruime gebruik van snelle breedbanddiensten te verzekeren tegen voorwaarden die meer overeenkomen met minder afgelegen gebieden die dichter bevolkt zijn en relatief meer bedrijven tellen. Voorts wordt erkend dat de bestaande kaderregelingen en richtsnoeren niet kunnen worden toegepast voor de beoordeling van steunmaatregelen die dit specifiek tot doel hebben. De Commissie is derhalve van mening dat de toetsing van de verenigbaarheid van de maatregel met de gemeenschappelijke markt rechtstreeks op artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het EG-Verdrag dient te worden gebaseerd [6].
28. In artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), EG-Verdrag wordt bepaald dat:
%quot%steunmaatregelen om de ontwikkeling van bepaalde vormen van economische bedrijvigheid of van bepaalde regionale economieën te vergemakkelijken, mits de voorwaarden waaronder het handelsverkeer plaatsvindt daardoor niet zodanig worden veranderd dat het gemeenschappelijke belang wordt geschaad, als verenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt kunnen worden beschouwd%quot%.
29. In het kader van een toetsing aan artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het EG-Verdrag houdt dit in dat de overheidsmaatregel noodzakelijk moet zijn en in verhouding dient te staan tot het beoogde doel van algemeen belang, d.w.z. de correctie van een gebrekkige marktwerking.
Noodzakelijkheid
30. De toegang tot een breedbandnetwerk is een voorziening die door zijn aard een positieve invloed kan hebben op de productiviteit en de groei van een groot aantal sectoren en activiteiten [7]. Er zijn aanwijzingen dat een grotere beschikbaarheid van breedbandnetwerken ten goede kan komen aan de regionale economische ontwikkeling en de schepping en het behoud van werkgelegenheid, alsook verbeterde gezondheids- en onderwijsvoorzieningen [8].
31. De autoriteiten stellen dat de maatregel gericht is tegen een gebrekkige marktwerking: Appingedam is een achterstandsgebied waar de netwerkeigenaren Essent en KPN niet hun netwerken willen upgraden noch toegang willen verlenen tot hun core-netwerken of %quot%dark fibre%quot% aan providers die FTTH willen aanbieden. De autoriteiten hebben ook verklaard dat Essent en KPN pas na de aankondiging van de gemeente dat zij haar eigen FTTH-initiatief zou lanceren, hun netwerken hebben geüpgraded teneinde breedbanddiensten aan te bieden.
32. Het is evenwel de vraag of er bij de situatie in Appingedam wel sprake is van een %quot%gebrekkige marktwerking%quot%. In de eerste plaats voorziet de markt, aldus de autoriteiten, niet in de FTTH-infrastructuur omdat het verwachte rendement op de investering onvoldoende was om een investering tegen marktvoorwaarden te rechtvaardigen. Dit kan worden verklaard door een lage vraag naar breedbanddiensten alsook de hoge kapitaaluitgaven voor de aanleg van de infrastructuur.
33. In de tweede plaats is, aldus de Commissie, de toegang tot een breedbandnetwerk al beschikbaar in Appingedam hoewel de diensten die thans worden verstrekt, niet geheel vergelijkbaar zijn met de diensten die met het geplande netwerk zouden kunnen worden aangeboden. KPN en Essent bieden allebei retail-breedbanddiensten aan tot 8Mbit/s en KPN biedt tot op zekere hoogte ook wholesale-toegang tot infrastructuur en diensten. Bijgevolg is er een aanzienlijke overlapping van netwerkdekking en dienstverlening, die tot de beste in de Europese Unie behoren, en daarom valt het te betwijfelen of er sprake is van een %quot%marktfalen%quot%, die met deze maatregel kan worden verholpen.
Evenredigheid
34. Om te bepalen of de maatregel verenigbaar is met de gemeenschappelijke markt, dient ook de evenredigheid van de maatregel te worden onderzocht. De maatregel dient in verhouding te staan tot het beoogde doel en mag de concurrentie niet zo zeer vervalsen dat het gemeenschappelijke belang wordt geschaad.
35. Er dient te worden erkend dat de technische kenmerken van bijvoorbeeld glasvezelaansluitnetwerken verschillen van de bestaande kabel- en telecommunicatienetwerken in Appingedam. Er kan worden aangevoerd dat de nieuwe generatie netwerken niet te vergelijken valt met de bestaande netwerken omdat zij andere en veel geavanceerdere diensten mogelijk maken dan de bestaande netwerken. Volgens degenen die zich hierop beroepen kan overheidssteun voor de volgende generatie van openbaar toegankelijke, lokale aansluitnetwerken een positief effect hebben op de economische ontwikkeling vanwege de positieve externe effecten die deze netwerken zullen hebben op innovatie en groei. Bovendien hebben de bestaande exploitanten van elektronische communicatienetwerken (nog) niet in deze infrastructuur geïnvesteerd vanwege de hoge kapitaaluitgaven en omdat hun bestaande investeringen daardoor niet meer van nut zouden zijn. Wanneer deze redenering wordt doorgetrokken, zou staatssteun voor de nieuwe generatie netwerken een gewenst middel kunnen zijn om het tempo van innovatie en economische ontwikkeling te versnellen, zelfs tegen de prijs dat in het verleden gedane investeringen mogelijk worden ondermijnd en toekomstige investeringen ontmoedigd.
36. In dit stadium valt evenwel moeilijk te bezien welke toepassingen of diensten aan particulieren en bedrijven kunnen worden aangeboden die niet met behulp van breedbanddiensten via de bestaande netwerken kunnen worden verschaft. Dit betekent dat er sprake is van een hoge substitueerbaarheid tussen enerzijds de retail en wholesale-diensten die via het geplande FTTH-netwerk worden verstrekt en anderzijds de diensten die via de bestaande netwerken worden verstrekt, waardoor de maatregel de mededinging in de nabije toekomst ernstig zou kunnen vervalsen. Dit geldt des te meer in het licht van een aantal geplande ontwikkelingen. KPN heeft aangekondigd dat zij de capaciteit van haar dienstverlening zal verhogen en Essent onderzoekt de mogelijkheid om de superbreedbandverbinding ETTH (Ethernet to the home) via haar bestaande netwerken aan te bieden, waardoor de capaciteit van haar netwerk aanzienlijk wordt vergroot. De maatregel die door de autoriteiten wordt voorzien, houdt daarom een ernstig risico in van verdringing van bestaande en toekomstige investeringen door marktpartijen als gevolg van de overheidssteun. Onder de gegeven omstandigheden is het daarom de vraag of de geplande maatregel en het gebruik als zodanig van het steuninstrument als evenredig kunnen worden beschouwd.
Conclusie
37. Op grond van het voorgaande en de informatie die in dit stadium beschikbaar is, betwijfelt de Commissie of de betwiste maatregel verenigbaar is met de gemeenschappelijke markt in overeenstemming met artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het EG-Verdrag.
VI. Besluit
38. In het licht van het voorgaande heeft de Commissie besloten de procedure van artikel 88, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag in te leiden ten aanzien van de betwiste maatregel omdat zij betwijfelt of deze verenigbaar is met de gemeenschappelijke markt in overeenstemming met artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het EG-Verdrag.
Gelet op de bovenstaande overwegingen verzoekt de Commissie Nederland in het kader van de procedure van artikel 88, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag binnen een maand vanaf de datum van ontvangst van dit schrijven zijn opmerkingen te maken en alle dienstige inlichtingen te verstrekken voor de beoordeling van de steunmaatregel. Zij verzoekt uw autoriteiten onverwijld een afschrift van deze brief aan de potentiële begunstigden van de steunmaatregel te doen toekomen.
De Commissie wijst Nederland op de schorsende werking van artikel 88, lid 3, van het EG-Verdrag. Zij verwijst naar artikel 14 van Verordening (EG) nr. 659/1999, volgens hetwelk elke onrechtmatige steun van de begunstigden kan worden teruggevorderd.
Voorts deelt de Commissie Nederland mee, dat zij de belanghebbenden door de bekendmaking van dit schrijven en van een samenvatting ervan in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie in kennis zal stellen. Tevens zal zij de belanghebbenden in de lidstaten van de EVA die partij zijn bij de EER-Overeenkomst door de bekendmaking van een mededeling in het EER-supplement van het Publicatieblad in kennis stellen, alsmede de Toezichthoudende Autoriteit van de EVA door haar een afschrift van dit schrijven toe te zenden. Alle bovengenoemde belanghebbenden zal worden verzocht hun opmerkingen te maken binnen een maand vanaf de datum van deze bekendmaking.%quot%

Council Common Position (EC) No 9/2006
adopted by the Council on 9 March 2006
with a view to adopting a Regulation (EC) No …/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of … amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation
(2006/C 179 E/01)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1],
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2],
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 [3] provided for common safety standards listed in Annex II to that Regulation with respect, in particular, to the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of aircraft, as well as persons and organisations involved in those tasks. Those harmonised safety standards applied to all aircraft operated by Community operators, whether such aircraft are registered in a Member State or in a third country.
(2) Article 4(1) of that Regulation requires the adoption of common technical requirements and administrative procedures, on the basis of Article 80(2) of the Treaty, for the fields that were not listed in Annex II to that Regulation.
(3) Article 9 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers [4] provides that the granting and validity at any time of an operating licence shall be dependent upon the possession of a valid air operator's certificate specifying the activities covered by the operating licence and complying with the criteria to be established in a prospective Regulation. It is now appropriate to establish such criteria.
(4) The Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) have adopted a set of harmonised rules for commercial air transportation by aeroplane, called Joint Aviation Requirements Commercial Air Transportation (Aeroplanes)) (JAR-OPS 1), as amended. Those rules (Amendment 8 of 1 January 2005) provide for a minimum level of safety requirements and therefore constitute a good basis for Community legislation covering the operation of aeroplanes. Changes had to be made to JAR-OPS 1 in order to bring it into conformity with Community legislation and policies, account being taken of its numerous implications in the economic and social field. That new text cannot be introduced into Community law by simple reference to JAR-OPS 1 in Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91. A new Annex containing the common rules should therefore be added to that Regulation.
(5) Air operators should be given sufficient flexibility to address unforeseen urgent operational circumstances, or operational needs of a limited duration, or to demonstrate that they can achieve an equivalent level of safety by means other than the application of the common rules set out in the Annex (hereinafter referred to as Annex III). Member States should therefore be empowered to grant exemptions or introduce variations to the common technical requirements and administrative procedures. Because such exemptions and variations could, in certain cases, undermine the common safety standards or create distortions on the market, their scope should be strictly limited and their grant should be subject to appropriate Community control. In that respect, the Commission should be empowered to take safeguard measures.
(6) There exist well identified cases where Member States should be permitted to adopt or maintain national provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements, provided commonly established procedures are complied with and until Community rules based on scientific knowledge and best practices are established.
(7) The provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 concerning the committee procedure should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [5].
(8) The provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 relating to its scope should be adapted to take account of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency [6], as well as its implementation rules established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1702/2003 of 24 September 2003 laying down implementing rules for the airworthiness and environmental certification of aircraft and related products, parts and appliances, as well as for the certification of design and production organisations [7], and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 of 20 November 2003 on the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, parts and appliances, and on the approval of organisations and personnel involved in these tasks [8].
(9) This Regulation, in particular the provisions on flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements as set out in Subpart Q of Annex III, takes into account the limits and minimum standards already established in Directive 2000/79/EC [9]. The limits set out in that Directive should always be respected for mobile workers in civil aviation. The provisions of Subpart Q of Annex III and other provisions approved pursuant to this Regulation should in no circumstances be broader and thereby provide those workers with less protection.
(10) Member States should be able to continue to apply national provisions on flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements for crew members, provided that the limits established by such national provisions are below the maximum limits and above the minimum limits laid down in Subpart Q of Annex III.
(11) Member States should be able to continue to apply national provisions on flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements for crew members in areas that are at present not covered by Subpart Q of Annex III, e.g., the maximum daily flight duty period for single pilot operations and emergency medical operations, provisions regarding the reduction of flight duty periods, or the augmentation of rest periods when crossing multiple time zones.
(12) A scientific and medical evaluation of the provisions on flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements and, as appropriate, of the provisions on cabin crews should be made within a period of three years following the entry into force of this Regulation.
(13) This Regulation should not affect the application of provisions on inspections as laid down in the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and in Directive (EC) 2004/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports [10].
(14) Arrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. Such arrangements have yet to enter into operation.
(15) Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 should therefore be amended accordingly,

"Article 8
1. The provisions in Articles 3 to 7 shall not prevent a Member State from reacting immediately to a safety problem which involves a product, person or organisation subject to this Regulation.
If the safety problem results from an inadequate level of safety provided by the common technical requirements and administrative procedures, or shortcomings in these requirements and procedures, the Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures taken and the reasons therefor.
The Commission shall decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), whether an inadequate level of safety or a shortcoming in the common technical requirements and administrative procedures justifies the continuing application of the measures adopted pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph. In such a case, the Commission shall also take the necessary steps to amend the common technical requirements and administrative procedures concerned in accordance with Article 4 or Article 11. If the Member State's measures are found not to be justified, it shall revoke the measures in question.

In such cases the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission of its intention to grant such approval, the reasons therefor and the conditions foreseen to ensure that an equivalent level of safety is achieved.
The Commission shall, within a period of three months following the notification by a Member State, initiate the procedure referred to in Article 12(2) in order to decide whether the proposed approval of the measure can be granted.

If so, the Commission shall notify its decision to approve the measure to all Member States, which shall be entitled to apply the measure. The relevant provisions of Annex III may also be amended to reflect such a measure.

Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
renewing the restrictive measures in respect of Burma/Myanmar and repealing Regulation (EC) No 798/2004
(presented by the Commission)
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
1. On 28 October 1996, the Council imposed certain restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar by Common Position 1996/653/CFSP in view of the political situation in that country. These measures were subsequently extended and amended by Common Position 2000/346/CFSP and Common Position 2003/297/CFSP, expiring on 29 April 2004. These measures were renewed by Common Position 2004/423/CFSP, strengthened by Common Position 2004/730/CFSP, amended in Common Position 2005/149/CFSP, and extended and amended by Common Position 2005/340/CFSP.
2. Certain of the restrictive measures imposed against Burma/Myanmar were implemented in the Community by Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2004.
3. In view of its continuing concern about the political and human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar, the Council has decided in its Common Position 2006/…/CFSP to maintain restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar and to consolidate and update the text.
4. In view of these changes, it is desirable to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2004 and publish a new consolidated Regulation.
Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
renewing the restrictive measures in respect of Burma/Myanmar and repealing Regulation (EC) No 798/2004
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60 and 301 thereof,
Having regard to Council Common Position 2006/…/CFSP renewing restrictive measures in respect of Burma/Myanmar[1],
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[2],
Whereas:
(1) On 28 October 1996, the Council, concerned at the absence of progress towards democratisation and at the continuing violation of human rights in Burma/Myanmar, imposed certain restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar by Common Position 1996/653/CFSP[3]. These measures were subsequently extended and amended by Common Position 2000/346/CFSP[4] and Common Position 2003/297/CFSP[5], and then renewed by Common Position 2004/423/CFSP[6], strengthened by Common Position 2004/730/CFSP[7], amended by Common Position 2005/149/CFSP[8] and extended and amended by Common Position 2005/340/CFSP[9]. Some of the restrictive measures imposed against Burma/Myanmar were implemented at Community level by Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2004[10].
(2) In view of the current political situation in Burma/Myanmar, as witnessed by:
- the failure of the military authorities to enter into substantive discussions with the democratic movement concerning a process leading to national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy;
- the failure to allow a genuine and open National Convention;
- the continuing detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, other members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and other political detainees;
- the continued harassment of the NLD and other organised political movements;
- the continuing serious violations of human rights, including the failure to take action to eradicate the use of forced labour in accordance with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation's High-Level Team report of 2001 and recommendations and proposals of subsequent ILO missions;
- and recent developments such as increasing restrictions on the operation of international organisations and non-governmental organisations,
Common Position 2006/…/CFSP provides for the maintenance of the restrictive measures against the military regime in Burma/Myanmar, those who benefit most from its misrule, and those who actively frustrate the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy.
(3) The restrictive measures provided for by Common Position 2006/…/CFSP include inter alia a ban on technical assistance, financing and financial assistance related to military activities, a ban on the export of equipment which might be used for internal repression, the freezing of funds and economic resources of members of the Government of Burma/Myanmar and of any natural or legal persons, entities or bodies associated with them, and a prohibition on making financial loans or credits available to, and on acquiring or extending a participation in, Burmese state-owned enterprises.
(4) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to ensuring their uniform application by economic operators in all Member States, Community legislation is necessary to implement them as far as the Community is concerned.
(5) For the sake of clarity, a new text containing all the relevant provisions as amended should be adopted, replacing Regulation (EC) No 798/2004, which should be repealed.
(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty concerning the
common position of the Council on the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the 7th Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)
1. BACKGROUND
Date of the transmission of the proposal to the EP and Council (document COM(2005) 119 final - 2005/0043(COD) and 2005/0044(CNS)) : | 13 April 2005 |
Date of the opinion of the Committee of Regions: | 16 November 2005 |
Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 14 December 2005 |
Date of the opinion of the European Parliament in the first reading: | 15 June 2006 |
Date of transmission of the amended proposal to the EP and Council | 28 June 2006 |
Date of adoption of the Common Position: | 25 September 2006 |
2. Commission’s position on the common position
In accordance with Article 251 of the EC Treaty, the present communication sets out the Commission’s position on the Council’s Common Position, adopted by qualified majority on 25 September 2006 concerning the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, following the political agreement reached on the 24 July 2006. Political agreement on the Euratom Framework Programme was also reached on 24 July 2006.
Broadly, the Common Position maintains the structure and content of the Framework Programme proposed by the Commission and is, in overall terms, highly consistent with the opinion of the European Parliament.
The Council has incorporated a large majority of the amendments adopted in the opinion of the European Parliament, on the first reading (15 June 2006) and accepted by the Commission in its amended proposal[1].
3. Comments on the common position
The Commission regards the Common Position as a good basis for further negotiations on the Framework Programme with a view to reaching a second reading agreement.
As regards the budget , the Council (and the European Parliament) has endorsed the overall amount of EUR 50,521 million which the Commission proposed in its amended proposal[2], following the conclusion on 17 May 2006 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. [3]
On the budget breakdown , the Common Position is broadly consistent with the Commission amended proposal and the Parliament opinion, with the exception of:
- In Cooperation
- Increased amounts for five themes : “Health”, “Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies”, “Energy”, “Environment” as well as a small increase in “Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities”;
- A reduction in the theme “Security and Space”.
- In Capacities
- A major decrease in “Research infrastructures” as well as a decrease in “Science in Society”;
- Increased amounts for “Research for the benefit of SMEs” and “Research Potential” as well as a small increase in “Activities of International Cooperation”.
Although, there is a strong correlation between the proposed activities and the proposed budget, the reduced budget for Infrastructures and for the Theme Security and Space might not allow the full implementation of the activities proposed in the common position.
As regards the structure of the programme, the Common Position maintains the various components of the programme proposed by the Commission, including the focus on the Themes and the flexible approach of the programme taking into account the seven year duration. The Commission agrees that the coherent development of policies should form a separate part in the Capacities programme. However, the Council has, in line with the Parliament, separated the theme on “Security and Space” into two themes, thus proposing ten themes. By keeping the two fields together the Commission believes significant flexibility and synergy could be achieved.
In terms of the research content , a large proportion of the amendments proposed by Parliament and accepted by the Commission in its modified proposal, are carried through into the common position. The Commission has in its modified proposal made clear that due to the reduction in the budget, the Commission did not include amendments which would mean a widening of the scope of the themes thus requiring more resources. The Commission believes that the common position essentially respects this. However, the inclusion of the “Exploratory Award Scheme” for SMEs in Capacities is not in line with this principle. The Commission believes the budget should be concentrated exclusively on the funding of projects.
The Commission endorses the strengthening of text on SMEs by proposing concrete measures in the themes, including by quantitative and qualitative analysis, which the Commission believes is a more efficient approach than artificial targets which the Commission did not take on board in the modified proposal.
Major issues for the Parliament have been the Joint Technology Initiatives, as well as the programmes Ideas and People.
- Concerning the Joint Technology Initiatives, the Common position includes the modifications of the criteria for the identification of Joint Technology Initiatives.
- Concerning Ideas, important clarifications have been included concerning the term of office, the renewal and the role of the Scientific Council, the management and the staffing arrangements; as well inclusion of the conduct of an independent review in 2010, presented to the Parliament and the Council, of the European Research Council's structures and mechanisms.
- Concerning People, a series of changes include references to the links of this programme with other parts of the Framework Programme and other community programmes, additions that make explicit the international dimension of this part of the programme, pointers to the establishment of appropriate working conditions of researchers and indications on the co-funding mode.
Finally, the criteria for the support to new research infrastructures are more detailed and the importance of regional aspects in the construction is acknowledged.
On stem cell related research , the Commission accepted, in its modified proposal, to include an article on which fields shall not be financed under the 7th Framework Programme in line with the Parliament’s amendment. Council has in its common position also included this article, and the Commission made a declaration re-confirming the practice to follow (see annex).
4. CONCLUSION
The Commission considers that the Common Position, adopted by qualified majority on 25 September 2006, presents a strong convergence with the positions of both the European Parliament and the Commission. It takes into account a large proportion of the amendments made by the European Parliament in its first reading and integrated by the Commission into its amended proposal. The Commission therefore supports the Common Position.

COM(2006) 564 final
2006/0194 (CNS)
Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010)
(presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1227}
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was established in 1986 in order to contribute to the implementation of Article 10(a) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985 which provides that "the two governments shall co-operate to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years, and shall consider the possibility of securing international support for this work" .
The objectives of the IFI are "to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland"*.
Following early contributions from the United States and other countries, the European Community, recognising that the objectives of the IFI were a reflection of those pursued by itself, wished to give practical support to the initiative. It began contributing to the IFI in 1989. EC funding now represents approximately 48 % of annual contributions to the Fund and 40 % of cumulative contributions to date. The Commission has been represented by an observer at all IFI Board meetings since the beginning of 1989.
The political background of the region has evolved over the years: in 1994, the main paramilitary groups announced cease-fires; in April 1998, the Belfast (“Good Friday”) Agreement set a political settlement for a peace process, including the devolution of powers to a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee, which were set up at the end of 1999. However, there is still a significant level of security related incidents with sectarian motivation and psychological and physical division between the main communities is on the rise. The NI Assembly is currently suspended, which illustrates the threats and uncertainties surrounding the peace process in the region.
In this context, economic and social development in support of peace and reconciliation at grassroots level is a long term process. As an instrument towards this goal, the IFI complements the action carried out by the EU Programmes for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Region of Ireland ("PEACE "I 1995-1999, "PEACE II" 2000-2006 and "PEACE III" 2007-2013).
Nevertheless, the International Fund knowing that the current level of international support cannot be maintained indefinitely, has performed, in 2005, a review of its structures and priorities in order to redefine its mission in light of the new realities and has adopted a strategic framework which will bring the life of the Fund to an end in 2010. This strategy is entitled "Sharing this Space" and launches the final phase of activities of the Fund (2006-2010). During this closing period the Fund will target the areas of greatest need and will seek to ensure that its work is made sustainable in the longer term.
In accordance with the current round of contributions**, the European Commission has also submitted an assessment of the IFI’s activities to the Budgetary Authority***. This acknowledges the IFI’s very valuable and positive actions for peace and reconciliation in the region, and thereby the fulfilment of its objectives. The report concluded that "the Commission believes that funding after 2006 should be provided on the basis of the observations made in this report, which could be reflected either in the future Council Regulation on the EC contribution to the IFI, or through other appropriate means of co-operation between the Commission and the IFI".
In light of the above assessment, it is proposed that EU contributions of € 15 million per year to the IFI continue for a further period of 4 years. The proposed new period will therefore end in 2010, which would coincide with the end of the life of the IFI.
The new Council Regulation should also reflect the observations made in the Commission report, in particular those reinforcing synergy of objectives and co-ordination with Structural Funds interventions, in particular with the new PEACE Programme and the provisions on closure.
The package of proposals for adoption include:
- a proposal for a Council Regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010);
- a Communication from the Commission on the Report on the International Fund for Ireland pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005.
2006/0194 (CNS)
Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1],
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[2],
Whereas:
(1) The International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter “the Fund”) was established in 1986 by the Agreement of 18 September 1986 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter “the Agreement”) in order to promote economic and social advance, and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland, in implementation of one of the objectives specified by the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985.
(2) The Community has provided financial contributions to the Fund from 1989. For the period 2005 to 2006 EUR 15 million was committed from the Community budget for each of the years 2005 and 2006 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 of 24 January 2005 on Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland[3]. That Regulation will expire on 31 December 2006.
(3) The assessments carried out in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 have confirmed the need for further support for activities of the Fund, while continuing reinforcing synergy of objectives and co-ordination with Structural Funds interventions, in particular with the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland (hereinafter “the PEACE programme”) set up in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds[4].
(4) The peace process in Northern Ireland requires a continuation of Community support to the Fund beyond 31 December 2006. In recognition of the special effort for the peace process, the PEACE programme has been allocated additional support from the Structural Funds for the period 2007 to 2013 pursuant to paragraph 22 of Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999[5].
(5) At its meeting in Brussels on 15 and 16 December 2005, the European Council called on the Commission to take the necessary steps with a view to continued Community support for the Fund as it enters the crucial final phase of its work up to 2010.
(6) The Community contribution to the Fund should take the form of financial contributions for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, thus terminating at the same time as the life of the Fund.
(7) In allocating the Community contribution, the Fund should give priority to projects of a cross-border or cross-community nature, in such a way as to complement the activities funded by the PEACE programme for the period 2007 to 2010.
(8) In accordance with the Agreement, all financial contributors to the Fund participate as observers at the meetings of the Board of the International Fund for Ireland.
(9) It is vital to ensure proper co-ordination between the activities of the Fund and those financed under the Community Structural Funds provided for by Article 159 of the Treaty, in particular the PEACE programme.
(10) Assistance from the Fund should be regarded as effective only in so far as it brings about sustainable economic and social improvement and is not used as a substitute for other public or private expenditure.
(11) An assessment reviewing the closure provisions of the Fund should be carried out before 1 July 2008.
(12) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of Point 38 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management[6] is inserted in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without the powers of the budgetary authority as defined by the Treaty being affected thereby.
(13) The amount of the Community contribution to the Fund should be EUR 15 million for each of the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, expressed in current values.
(14) That support will contribute to reinforcing solidarity between the Member States and between their peoples.
(15) The Treaty provides no powers other than those in Article 308 for the adoption of this Regulation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

Proposal for a
COUNCIL DECISION
Providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova
(presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1258}
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL |
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission proposes to provide macro-financial assistance to Moldova in the form of a grant of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million with a view to supporting Moldova's balance of payments and the reserve build-up. The proposed assistance will help Moldova alleviate the financial constraints on the implementation of its economic programme. It will also facilitate and encourage the authorities' efforts to implement reforms under the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The proposed macro-financial assistance will be exceptional and limited in time, will complement support from the Bretton Woods Institutions, bilateral donors and the Paris Club, and will be conditional, in particular, on progress in the implementation of the IMF-supported PRGF arrangement. This operation will take place at a time when EU-Moldova relations have entered a phase of deeper integration in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. |
120 | General context In the initial stage of its transition to market economy, Moldova implemented successfully a number of first generation reforms. Subsequently, towards the end of the nineties and in the beginning of the current decade, reforms slowed down and the government's administrative interference in the economy increased. Against this background, policy lending by the Bretton Woods Institutions was discontinued. Two EU macro-financial assistance operations for Moldova – a loan of EUR 15 million decided in 2000 and a grant of the same amount decided in 2002[1]– could therefore not be implemented. In this period, Moldova's GDP grew at an average annual growth rate of 7%. Growth has been driven by domestic demand boosted by booming remittances that have increased over time to more than 30% of GDP. By 2005, Moldova's GDP per capita had more than doubled (in dollar terms) compared to its level in 2000. Yet, at only USD 812, it is still by far the lowest in Europe. Moldova is the only country in Europe to be classified as low-income by the World Bank. Towards 2004-2005, structural reforms re-appeared on the Moldova's policy agenda, notably with the adoption by the government of the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP). The government’s commitment to reforms has been reinforced by its European aspirations, confirmed by the adoption in February 2005 of the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan. For most of 2005, the government pursued economic policy intended to demonstrate this renewed stabilisation and reform commitment. In view of the results achieved, towards the end of 2005, the authorities and the IMF resumed discussions on a new programme that could be supported by a financing arrangement with the Fund. In February 2006 an agreement was reached on the parameters of such programme and in May 2006 the IMF Board approved a three-year financing arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The approval of the arrangement was followed by an agreement with the Paris Club of Moldova's official creditors on a restructuring of accumulated arrears and current payments falling due in the period of the programme on the so-called Houston terms. Helping the government normalise Moldova's relations with the official creditors was one of the key objectives of the arrangement. The PRGF programme is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and in this way to support growth and poverty reduction, particularly in the context of continued strong inflows of remittances and substantially higher prices for imported energy. Under the programme, the authorities are committed to limit the budget deficit to 0.5% of GDP and the National Bank is aiming at increasing foreign exchange reserves to three months of imports by end-2008. The priority structural policy measures include in particular actions in the areas of foreign trade liberalisation, corporate governance, banking sector reform and tax administration. By the time of the adoption of the programme, it was assumed that the contemplated policies would translate into GDP growth of 6% in 2006 and 5% in 2007-2008, a gradual reduction of inflation to about 7% by end-2008 and current account deficits in the neighbourhood of 5% of GDP. Yet, the programme is being implemented in a particularly difficult external environment. Already in 2005, due in particular to a strong increase in oil prices, Moldova's trade and current account deficits had increased sharply. Since the beginning of 2006, Moldova is facing additional balance-of-payments shocks – a decision by Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, to increase the gas prices it charges to Moldova from USD 80 per thousand cubic meters to USD 110 in January 2006 and USD 160 in July, and a ban on Moldova's exports of wine and alcohol to Russia – that make the prospects for achieving the objectives of the PRGF programme extremely weak. The weakening of Moldova's external accounts will also complicate the achievement of the government's medium-term objectives in terms of growth and poverty reduction contained in the government's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and of the goals of the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan. The economic developments in Moldova will require, first, some adjustment of the PRGF programme and, second, additional exceptional financing, on top of the financing currently available. In the past the EU has provided on several occasions macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Moldova aimed at responding to balance-of-payments shocks. The Commission considers that the current situation justifies a further recourse to the same instrument. EU MFA would contribute to meeting Moldova's external financing requirements in 2007 and 2008. This is further warranted by deepening EU-Moldova cooperation in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Moldova is one of the EU partner countries in this context since the ENP was launched in 2004. Moldova is also, together with Ukraine, the only Eastern Neighbourhood country currently implementing an ENP Action Plan. The ENP aims at developing an increasingly close relationship between the EU and the partner countries, going beyond past levels of cooperation, at deepening political cooperation including in the area of foreign and security policy and, in the case of Moldova, in the resolution of the conflict in Transnistria, and at promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. |
130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal None |
140 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union EU-Moldova relations have entered a phase of deeper integration since the launching of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Community's assistance through the macro-financial assistance instrument would contribute to the strengthening of the bilateral relations with Moldova. It is envisaged that from 2007 onwards the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will become available to Moldova, allowing assistance also in the form of budget support. Preparation of sectoral and/or general budget support programmes in favour of Moldova is expected to start as soon as the ENPI becomes operational. However, no disbursements under ENPI budget support are anticipated in the near future. Moreover, the instrument of budget support under the ENPI, designed to support structural policies in a medium- to long-term perspective, is not well adapted to Moldova's current difficulties resulting largely from short-term balance of payment shocks. Financing under the macro-financial assistance instrument is expected to be available well before a possible budget support operation under the ENPI. MFA, as a short-term instrument, will be specifically addressing the currently pressing external financing needs of Moldova arising from a significant deterioration of the country's external economic environment. Yet, macro-financial assistance will also support in the interim period structural reforms contemplated in the EU-Moldova Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. |
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT |
Consultation of interested parties |
219 | Moldova's Finance Minister Mihail Pop requested financial assistance from the EC in May 2006. Commission services have been in contact with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and bilateral donors during the preparation of the present Commission proposal to discuss assistance needs. The Commission has consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal. Following the adoption of the Council Decision, the Commission services will negotiate with the authorities of Moldova a Memorandum of Understanding and the grant agreement to lay down in detail the implementation modalities of the assistance. |
Collection and use of expertise |
229 | There was no need for external expertise. |
230 | Impact assessment Because macro-financial assistance is a policy-based instrument, it is particularly well-suited to support the efforts of the authorities of Moldova to improve the fiscal sustainability in the short-to-medium run. Macro-financial assistance will have an immediate impact on Moldova's balance of payments and reserves and will in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities' economic programme. EC assistance will also help the authorities implement short- and medium-term policies identified in the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. |
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL |
305 | Summary of the proposed action The Community shall make available to Moldova macro-financial assistance in the form of grants of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million. The assistance will be made available in three instalments over a period of two years. The period of the implementation of the programme could be extended by one more year. The assistance will be managed by the Commission which shall agree with the authorities the specific economic policy and financial conditions attached to the payment of the grant instalments. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, will be duly taken into account. |
310 | Legal basis Article 308 of the Treaty |
329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. |
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). |
331 | The amount of the assistance corresponds broadly to one-third of the residual financing needs of Moldova for the years 2007-2008, covered by the assistance. This is deemed an appropriate level of burden sharing for the Community, given the assistance provided to Moldova by bilateral donors and creditors and the international donor community at large. The assistance will be fully consistent with the macroeconomic targets already set in Moldova's economic policy documents, such as the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies in the context of the PRGF arrangement with the IMF, approved in May 2006. It will be also consistent with longer-term policy objectives contemplated in the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approved in May 2004 and with the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan adopted in February 2005. As regards specific conditions attached to the disbursement of the grant instalments, the Commission intends to focus on a limited number of areas, including in particular public finance management. Also, the Commission may consider targeting specific sectoral policies of particular importance, identified as such in the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan. |
Choice of instruments |
341 | Proposed instruments: other. |
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). In the absence of a framework regulation for the macro-financial assistance instrument, ad hoc Council decisions under Article 308 of the Treaty are the only available legal instrument for this assistance. |
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION |
401 | Such assistance would be financed from commitment appropriations in 2007 under budget line 01 03 02 (Macroeconomic assistance), subject to final approval of the 2007 EC Budget, with payments taking place in 2007 and 2008. |

2006/0198 (ACC)
Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
on trade in certain steel products between the Community and Ukraine
(presented by the Commission)
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL |
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Community's Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Ukraine provides that trade in certain steel products must be the subject of an Agreement between the Parties. |
120 | General context The current Agreement will expire on 31 December 2006. Both Parties are willing to conclude a new Agreement for 2007 and subsequent years. However, the new Agreement will not be in force by 1 January 2007. Therefore, pending its entry into force, autonomous measures setting quotas as from 1 January 2007 have to be taken. |
130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Decision 2005/638/EC adopting the Agreement (OJ L 232, 8.9.2005, p. 42) and its implementing Council Regulation EC 1440/2005 (OJ L 232, 8.9.2005, p. 1). |
141 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. |
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT |
Consultation of interested parties |
219 | The parties were consulted on a related proposal. This Regulation actually continues a system that is in place since several years. |
Collection and use of expertise |
229 | There was no need for external expertise. |
230 | Impact assessment not applicable |
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL |
305 | Summary of the proposed action This Council Regulation sets quantitative limits as from 1 January and will last until the new agreement will enter into force. |
310 | Legal basis Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the EC. |
329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. |
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). |
331 | The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). Import of steel products covered by this Council Regulation are subject to a quota and to an import authorization. EU importers apply for the necessary import authorization to the Member States competent authorities. The competent authority checks the conformity of the documentation submitted by the applicant and verifies electronically with a central data base that the required quantities are available and then releases the import authorization. The implementing mechanism is designed to minimize the number of intervening parties. The system is thus rather light, with very limited levels involved and no involvement from the Commission services. |
332 | International agreements with the same objective and the same operational rules have been concluded since several years. The absence of request for modifications by all the parties involved may be interpreted as confirming that operators and national administrations see the system as reasonably light. |
Choice of instruments |
341 | Proposed instruments: regulation. |
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). It is the only way to set quantitative limits. |
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION |
409 | The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. |

Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
on trade in certain steel products between the Community and Ukraine
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Article 22(1) of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, and Ukraine[1] provides that trade in some steel products are to be subject to a specific Agreement on quantitative arrangements.
(2) The current bilateral Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Ukraine on trade in certain steel products signed on 29 July 2005[2] will expire on 31 December 2006.
(3) Preliminary discussions between the Parties indicate that both of them intend to conclude a new Agreement for 2007 and subsequent years.
(4) Pending the signature and entry into force of the new Agreement, quantitative limits for the year 2007 should be established.
(5) Given that the conditions that led to the fixing of the quantitative limits for 2006 remain in place, it is appropriate to set the quantitative limits for 2007 at the same level as for 2006.
(6) It is necessary to provide the means to administer this regime within the Community in such a way as to facilitate the implementation of the new Agreement by envisaging as much as possible similar provisions.
(7) It is necessary to ensure that the origin of the products in question is checked and appropriate methods of administrative cooperation are set up to this end.
(8) Products placed in a free zone or imported under the arrangements governing customs warehouses, temporary importation or inward processing (suspension system) should not be counted against the limits established for the products in question.
(9) The effective application of this Regulation calls for the introduction of a requirement for a Community import licence for the entry into free circulation in the Community of the products in question.
(10) In order to ensure that these quantitative limits are not exceeded, it is necessary to establish a management procedure whereby the competent authorities of the Member States do not issue import licences before obtaining prior confirmation from the Commission that appropriate amounts remain available within the quantitative limit in question,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. This Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007 to imports into the Community of steel products listed in Annex I originating in Ukraine.

Article 2
1. The importation into the Community of the steel products listed in Annex I originating in Ukraine shall be subject to the quantitative limits laid down in Annex V.

Date of application : After receipt of approval, by means of a notification, together with the identification number indicating Commission receipt of this summary information on the individual aid granted
Duration of scheme or individual aid award : From July 2005 to November 2010 approximately
Aim of the aid :
The individual aid will be granted for investment in a livestock breeding centre with a view to maintaining protection standards for the natural environment and to improving hygiene conditions and livestock welfare. The investment will be used to remove dangerous roofing containing asbestos and to replace it with new roofing free of that substance.
This work is primarily required because of the decision of the Namysłowski District Buildings Inspector of 2 July 2004 ordering %quot%FERMA-POL%quot% in Zalesie to remove materials containing asbestos from its premises. The decision stated that damage to asbestine tiles could result in the release of asbestos fibres into the atmosphere, so causing a threat to human health and the environment, including domestic livestock in this case.
Exposure to asbestos carries with it the risk of diseases affecting the respiratory system such as asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural lesions, etc.; this has been borne out by experiments conducted since the 1970s. In 1977 European Community experts drew up a report on the risk to public health caused by environmental exposure to asbestos dust, confirming its pathogenic effect.
The investment moreover falls within the Programme to remove asbestos and products containing asbestos used on Polish terrority, adopted by the Polish Council of Ministers on 14 May 2002, one of whose aims is to rid Poland of asbestos and the products containing it that have been in use for many years now.
The aid will be granted under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 for investment in a livestock breeding center. The eligible costs will include investment costs on property improvements
Sector(s) concerned : The aid is granted to entrepreneurs engaged in agricultural activity in the livestock production sector.

Konstruktorska 3A, 02-673 Warsaw, through the agency of the Bank Ochrony Środowiska S.A. (Bank for Environmental Protection), Al. Jana Pawła II 12, 00-950 Warsaw

- The gross grant equivalent resulting from the soft loan has been calculated in accordance with the method laid down in point 3 of Annex I to the Guidelines on national regional aid (OJ C 74, 10.3.1998, p. 9), but with one difference: income tax has not been taken into account. The gross grant equivalent amounts to PLN: 42770,54.

Note 1 Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal ("dow"), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise.
Note 2.1 The new (or amended) standard has the same scope as the superseded standard. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.
Note 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.
Note 4 The presumption of conformity given by EN 420:2003 with regard to the BHSR 1.2.1.1 and concerning the content of Cr(VI) of the glove materials is subjected to the detection limit of the test method for Cr(VI) to be 3 mg/kg or lower.

TEXT OF SUMMARY
1. PROCEDURE
Non-notified case.
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE COMMISSION IS INITIATING THE PROCEDURE
national legal basis : decision of the Management Board of SNCB/NMBS;
granting authority within Member State : Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Belge (SNCB)/Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen (NMBS);
form of aid : granting of an extension for payment of debts of EUR 63 million; granting of a recoverable advance of EUR 5 million; granting of a credit facility of EUR 15 million; conversion into a capital increase of debts of EUR 63 million and a loan of EUR 15 million; increase in additional capital of EUR 5 million through contribution in kind from TRW shares;
duration : indefinite;
beneficiary(ies) : InterFerryBoats SA/NV;
objective/purpose : restructuring aid;
budget, origin of resources used to finance the aid and amounts (per year) : granting of an extension for payment of debts of EUR 63 million; granting of a recoverable advance of EUR 5 million; granting of a credit facility of EUR 15 million; conversion into a capital increase of debts of EUR 63 million and a loan of EUR 15 million; increase in additional capital of EUR 5 million through contribution in kind from TRW shares.
3. ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURE
The decision taken by SNCB/NMBS on 7 April 2003 to grant restructuring aid to IFB is attributable to the Belgian State, since the submission of the restructuring plan to it for approval, as well as articles published in the press, indicate that it influenced the decision. On the other hand, the Commission has doubts about whether the tacit granting of extensions for payments by SNCB/NMBS since 2001 at the earliest and 19 September 2002 at the latest is attributable to the Belgian State.
SNCB/NMBS has not behaved like a creditor (as regards the extension for payment), or like an informed investor in a market economy (as regards the remaining measures) given that the return on the capital invested is below what such an investor would have accepted.
The cash aid cannot be regarded as rescue aid since its duration exceeds twelve months.
For aid to be regarded as restructuring aid compatible with the common market, a firm must be eligible within the meaning of the restructuring guidelines and the aid has to satisfy five conditions:
(1) The restructuring plan must make it possible to restore the long-term viability of the firm within a reasonable period.
(2) Measures must be taken to mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of the aid on competitors.
(3) The aid must be limited to the strict minimum needed to enable restructuring to be carried out, and the firm must make a contribution to its restructuring.
(4) The Commission must be able to satisfy itself, on the basis of regular detailed reports, that the restructuring plan is being implemented properly.
(5) The restructuring aid should be granted once only.
The Commission cannot at this stage rule out the possibility that IFB received part of the aid less than three years after it was set up. It therefore has doubts about whether IFB is eligible for the restructuring aid.
It emerges from the Commission's examination that criteria 1, 4 and 5 are met. However, the Commission has doubts about whether the measures taken to mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of the aid on competitors are sufficient, and whether IFB's own contribution is sufficient.
With regard to mitigating adverse effects on competition: the Belgian authorities have indicated that IFB has taken the following two measures to mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of the aid on competitors:
- it has virtually closed down its activities in France,
- in Belgium it has closed the Bressoux terminal and sold its shares in the terminals in Brussels and Zeebrugge.
These two measures reduced its turnover from EUR 62 million in 2002 to EUR 58 million in 2003. However, given that these measures appear to concern loss-making activities, the Commission has doubts about whether it can take them into account.
To determine whether these two measures are sufficient to mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of the aid on competitors, it is necessary to take into consideration the main developments on the two markets on which IFB operates, namely the logistics market and the freight transhipment market. Subsequently, an analysis should be made of whether the measures proposed do mitigate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of the aid on competitors.
a) The logistics market and the aid for IFB
The logistics market is in a state of flux as a result of the opening-up of the rail transport markets and the entry of railway and postal undertakings on to the market, resulting in both a large number of small specialised operators and big integrated ones.
The Commission notes that the measures proposed do not concern the logistics market. IFB succeeded in increasing its volume on this market substantially in 2004 (compared with 2003). Belgium did not make any commitment which would have limited, at least temporarily, IFB's presence on this market.
The Commission therefore considers that the facts that no measures have been proposed concerning the logistics market, that the market is in a state of flux, and that IFB has succeeded in increasing its volume substantially raise doubts about whether Belgium has limited, as far as possible, any adverse effects on competition as far as IFB's logistics activities are concerned.
b) The freight transshipment market and the aid for IFB
The two measures proposed concern the freight transshipment market. IFB has virtually ceased its operations in France, and has closed one terminal in Belgium and sold its shares in two others.
Consequently, the Belgian market is the only one on which the aid may have adverse effects on competition. IFB has less than 7 % of this market.
To limit the adverse effects of the aid on the Belgian market, IFB has closed one terminal and sold its shares in two others. The Commission notes, however, that the smallest terminal was closed, that its closure was primarily intended to reduce the losses of IFB Terminals, and that, following the capital increase, IFB will once again be operating the two terminals which it sold, since SNCB/NMBS will transfer to IFB 47 % of its shares in TRW, which has major holdings in the Brussels and Zeebrugge terminals.
Moreover, TRW also operates many other terminals in Belgium. Consequently, the capital increase through the contribution in kind from TRW shares will have the effect of increasing IFB's share of the Belgian market.
The Commission further notes that IFB has minority holdings in a large number of Belgian terminals.
The Commission therefore has doubts about whether the measures proposed by IFB to limit, as far as possible, the adverse effects of the aid on competition on the transhipment market are sufficient.
With regard to IFB's own contribution: According to the information supplied by the Belgian Government, IFB does not itself appear to have contributed to its restructuring, as required by the 1999 and 2004 guidelines. The Commission therefore has doubts about whether IFB's own contribution is sufficient.

2. DESCRIPTION DÉTAILLÉE DES MESURES DE SAUVETAGE ET DE RESTRUCTURATION
2.1. Les parties du contrat cadre concernant le sauvetage et la restructuration d'IFB
2.1.1. IFB
2.1.1.1. Description de la société
12. Inter Ferry Boats ("IFB") est une société anonyme de droit belge. La SNCB détient 89,03 % du capital social. Les autres actionnaires sont CNC Transports, une filiale à 93,8 % de la SNCF (7,41 %), ICF (2,08 %), et EWS (English Welsh and Scottish Railway — 1,22 %). IFB compte aujourd'hui 245 employés.
13. La société IFB a été créée le 1er avril 1998 par la fusion des trois sociétés suivantes: Ferry Boats Ltd., Interferry Ltd. et le département "rail" de Edmond Depaire Ltd. Avant la création d'IFB, Ferry Boats Ltd a été une entreprise contrôlée de manière conjointe par les chemins de fer britannique et les chemins de fer belge. Interferrry Ltd et Edmond Depaire Ltd ont été contrôlés par les chemins de fer belge. Il ne ressort pas clairement des documents fournis par la Belgique si IFB continue la personnalité juridique d'une des trois sociétés.
14. La société Ferry Boats Ltd. a été créée en 1923 sous le nom "Société Belgo-Anglaise des Ferry-Boats". La société Interferry a été créée en 1967 sous le nom d' "Intercontainer", et la société Edmond Depaire en 1906 comme une société privé de transport des containers.
15. IFB poursuit surtout deux types d'activités:
- Le secteur d'activité "IFB Logistics", qui commercialise les activités d'expédition d'IFB et;
- Le secteur d'activité "IFB Terminals", qui exploite des terminaux continentaux.
À ces activités, il faut ajouter les participations et filiales qu'IFB détient ou détenait en Belgique et à l'étranger.
a) L'activité IFB Logistics
16. L'activité "IFB Logistics" concerne la commercialisation par IFB, ainsi que par les sociétés dans lesquelles elle détient une participation, de:
- Activités d'expédition (y compris des services complémentaires de "transport engineering"), et
- Activités logistiques.
17. Les activités d'expédition sont les activités principales d'"IFB Logistics". Elles consistent à offrir aux clients des solutions de transport aussi complètes que possible. Pour les activités d'expédition, le transport ferroviaire, qu'il soit conventionnel ou combiné, représente pour IFB le mode de transport principal, mais IFB offre aussi le transport par voie navigable et le transport routier. Pour IFB, le transport ferroviaire est surtout un transport de "courte" ou de "moyenne" distance (de 100 à 500 km, avec IFB se présentant surtout comme partenaire des armateurs pour le développement du "carrier haulage", qui est une activité complémentaire à celle des opérateurs ferroviaires, qui se concentrent plutôt sur les transports de "longue distance").
18. Les marchandises expédiées par IFB sont des produits en vrac, des conteneurs et des produits divers (general cargo). Le tableau suivant montre le volume de fret transporté par IFB en 2003 et 2004 par rail conventionnel, rail intermodal et voies navigables. Le transport routier n'est utilisé par IFB que pour l'acheminement des unités de transport vers ou leur évacuation depuis des terminaux ferroviaires et ce uniquement dans les cas où le client a demandé une prestation porte-à-porte ou de/vers un terminal maritime.
19. Les principaux clients d'IFB Logistics sont les sociétés de fret maritime […] [1] [2] et […] ainsi que les sociétés […] [3], […], […] [4] et […]. Les produits transportés sont notamment des produits chimiques, le charbon, et les granulâts. Le tableau suivant montre les volumes transportés par IFB en 2003 et 2004.
Année | Rail conventionnel [5] | Rail intermodal | Voie navigable |
2003 | 0,672 millions de tonnes | 423583 TEU [6] | 0,385 millions de tonnes |
2004 | 1,995 millions de tonnes | 481556 TEU | 1,023 millions de tonnes |
20. Les activités d'expédition comprennent également des services complémentaires de "transport engineering", tels le stockage en magasin, la distribution, les transbordements,…, qui y sont intimement liés.
21. Dans le cadre de son système d'organisation, l'activité d'agence pour compte d'expéditeurs/transporteurs ferroviaires tiers est également rattachée à IFB Logistics. IFB est active en tant qu'agent logistique en Belgique pour un certain nombre d'entreprises étrangères.
22. Le marché de l'expédition et des activités logistiques a connu une croissance importante pendant les dernières années, qui est liée à la globalisation croissante de l'industrie, la tendance vers la sous-traitance et une spécialisation de plus en plus poussée des entreprises de production (just in time production).
23. Les barrières à l'entrée sur le marché sont réduites, et le marché connaît à la fois la présence d'un nombre importants de petits acteurs spécialisés et de grands acteurs intégrés (DHL, UPS, …). Suite à l'ouverture des marchés du transport ferroviaire et des services postaux, des entreprises ferroviaires (Deutsche Bahn, SNCB) et des entreprises postales (Deutsche Post) ont fait leur entrée sur ce marché.
24. La combinaison de la croissance du marché, de l'entrée de nouveaux acteurs importants et de la libéralisation du transport ferroviaire fait de ce marché un marché en pleine mutation et mouvement.
b) IFB Terminals
25. IFB Terminals exploite des terminaux ferroviaires (transbordement d'Unités de Transport Intermodal (UTI) du/vers le chemin de fer) continentaux.
26. L'activité principale des terminaux continentaux ("dry ports") concerne le chargement de conteneurs maritimes de camions sur des wagons. Au total, IFB exploite six terminaux continentaux avec connexion au réseau ferroviaire en Belgique, dont quatre sont situés dans le port d'Anvers et trois autres à l'intérieur de la Belgique.
27. Les terminaux continentaux dans le port d'Anvers sont "Mainhub", "Cirkeldyck", "Zomerweg" et "Schijnpoort". Le gouvernement belge souligne que ces quatre terminaux se trouvent dans une situation spécifique, car ils sont situés au port d'Anvers, au cœur même de l'activité maritime à laquelle ils sont indissociablement liés. Les UTI traités dans ces terminaux sont principalement des conteneurs maritimes qui sont d'abord déchargés des navires vers des camions dans un terminal maritime, qui n'est pas exploité par IFB. Ce n'est que par la suite que ces conteneurs sont déchargés des camions vers des wagons de chemin de fer dans un terminal continental exploité par IFB. Pour l'exportation maritime, l'ordre inverse est suivi. En 2004, les quatre terminaux continentaux d'IFB situés dans le port d'Anvers ont traité un volume de 0,4 millions TEU.
28. IFB exploite deux terminaux continentaux qui ne sont pas situés dans le port d'Anvers, à savoir le terminal de Muizen (situé près de Malines, terminal route-rail) et le terminal de Rénory (situé près de Liège, trafic route-rail-barge). Un troisième terminal, celui de Bressoux, a été fermé en 2003.
29. Le marché des terminaux est un marché plus stable que le marché de la logistique. Le nombre des terminaux exploités en Belgique reste constant. Cependant, le nombre de containeurs transportés est en augmentation, suite à la croissance de trafic dans le port d'Anvers et aux efforts de transporter d'avantage de biens par le transport combiné.
c) Les participations d'IFB
30. IFB détient ou détenait des participations dans des sociétés exploitant des terminaux maritimes et continentaux ainsi que dans des sociétés de transport. Au total, IFB détient ou détenait une trentaine de participations.
31. Participations dans les terminaux maritimes et continentaux à Dunkerque. IFB a réalisé des investissements importants dans le port de Dunkerque, où elle détenait des participations majoritaires dans Acimar (terminal pour produits d'acier, filiale à 100 % de NFTI-ou), NFTI-ou (terminal de conteneurs maritimes, participation de 60 % en 2003, réduite à 30 % depuis), Dry Port Dunkerque (DPD, un terminal ferroviaire, participation de 90 % restée inchangée depuis 2003), Short Sea Terminal Dunkirk (SSTD, chargement et déchargement de semi-remorques, participation de 50 % en 2003, réduite à 0 % depuis), et IFB France (société de holding et de services aux sociétés liées sises à Dunkerque, participation de 100 %, vendue entièrement à NFTI-ou depuis).
32. IFB France a été renommée Administration Gestion Entreprise Portuaires (AGEP). IFB a cédé la totalité de ses parts dans cette société à la société NFTI-ou.
33. En décembre 2002, une procédure de redressement judiciaire a été entamée concernant Acimar. Acimar n'exerce plus d'activités depuis le 1er septembre 2003. La totalité des actions qu'IFB possédait dans Acimar a été cédée à AGEP (voir ci-dessous).
34. IFB a réduit sa participation dans NFTI-ou, qui détient AGEP et, via AGEP, Acimar, de 60 % à 30 %. IFB a révoqué tout patronage de NFTI-ou, en dénonçant sa lettre de confort. Ainsi, IFB s'est libérée de toute obligation de se porter garante pour NFTI-ou, cette obligation étant reportée intégralement sur l'actionnaire majoritaire, le Port Autonome de Dunkerque, qui détient 70 % des parts de NFTI-ou. IFB cherche maintenant à se défaire de sa participation minoritaire dans NFTI-ou.
35. IFB avait une participation de 90 % dans DPD. En juin 2003, IFB a dénoncé sa lettre de confort; ensuite, IFB a vendu les infrastructures et des équipements de DPD au Port Autonome de Dunkerque et dissout la société DPD en juin 2004. La liquidation s'est terminée à l'été 2005.
36. IFB a vendu sa participation dans SSTD en avril 2005.
37. En conclusion, IFB a vendu toutes ses participations dans le port de Dunkerque, à l'exception de sa participation minoritaire dans NFTI-ou, pour laquelle il est à la recherche d'un acquéreur.
38. Participation dans des terminaux en Belgique. En Belgique, IFB détenait des participations dans des terminaux à Zeebrugge, Bruxelles, Mouscron, Athus, Liège et Charleroi.
39. À Zeebrugge, IFB et Hesse-Noord Natie avaient créé le groupement d'intérêt économique OCHZ, dont IFB et Hesse-Noord Natie étaient les copropriétaires à 50 %. En septembre 2004, IFB s'est retiré de OCHZ et a vendu ses droits à OCHZ.
40. À Bruxelles, IFB possédait des intérêts dans un terminal à conteneurs tri-modal, situé dans le port de Bruxelles, par le biais des sociétés Brussels Port Invest (BPI) et Brussels Terminal Intermodal (BTI). BTI a entre-temps été dissoute et mise en liquidation. Quant à BPI, IFB a cédé sa participation à une autre société étrangère au groupe SNCB.
41. À Mouscron, IFB détient une participation de 16,76 % dans la SA Dryport Mouscron Lille (DPM Li). Cette société a des capitaux propres de 530000 EUR, et a réalisé en 2004 un résultat net de 76000 EUR.
42. À Athus, IFB détient une participation de 24,89 % dans la SA Terminal Athus (Terminal Athus). Cette société a des capitaux propres de 1,7 millions EUR, et a réalisé en 2002 un résultat net de 61000 EUR (pas de données plus récentes).
43. À Liège, IFB détient une participation de 45,12 % dans Liège Logistics Intermodal. La Commission ne dispose pas de plus d'informations sur cette participation.
44. À Charleroi, IFB détient une participation de 14,28 % dans la SA Charleroi Dry Port (Charleroi DP). Cette société a des capitaux propres de 36000 EUR, et a réalisé en 2002 un résultat net de 899 EUR (pas de données plus récentes).
45. En conclusion, IFB détient aujourd'hui des participations minoritaires dans quatre terminaux en Belgique, à savoir les terminaux Mouscron, Liège, Athus, Charleroi. En plus, IFB détient une participation dans la société qui exploite ces terminaux, qui est la société TRW, à la hauteur de 0,9 %. La SNCB détient dans TRW une participation directe de 47 %.
46. En revanche, IFB a vendu ses participations dans les terminaux de Zeebrugge et Bruxelles.
47. Participations dans des entreprises de transport. IFB possède ou possédait les participations suivantes dans des sociétés de transport:
- CNC Ferry Boats intermodal, Belgique, 50 % (capitaux propres: 61000 EUR, résultat net 2004: pas connu), et sa filiale à 100 %, Rail Web. Cette société a été dissoute le 31 mars 2005.
- Affrètements Van Reeth, Belgique, 100 % (capitaux propres: 412000 EUR; résultat net en 2002: 150000 EUR).

- RKE, Belgique, 61,46 % (capitaux propres: 2,6 millions EUR, résultat net 2004: 250000 EUR).
- Coil Terminal, indirectement par RKE, car RKE détient une participation de 50 % dans Coil Terminal.
- CARRE (pas d'informations supplémentaires). Pour cette société, des négociations de vente sont en cours.
- GIE Cigogne Shuttle, Belgique (pas d'informations supplémentaires). Pour cette société, IFB prévoit le retrait d'IFB de la société.

- TRW, Belgique, 0,89 %.
48. Participation dans Haeger and Schmidt International. A travers sa filiale à 100 % Haeger and Schmidt International, IFB détient des participations dans les sociétés Best Logistics (Pologne), A van Reeth (France), KREAS et SITRA. Haeger et Schmidt réalise un chiffre d'affaires annuelles de EUR 50 millions, principalement par le transport fluvial.

2.1.1.2. Définition des marchés concernés et parts de marchés de IFB
50. La Commission a statué dans le passé sur la définition des marchés pertinents pour les activités d'expédition et les activités logistiques dans ses décisions COMP/M.3603 "UPS/Menlo" et COMP/M.3496 "TNT FORWARDING HOLDING/WILSON LOGISTICS"; elle a retenu comme marché de produit pertinent:
- Pour les activités d'expédition ou freight forwarding: "the organisation of transportation items (possibly including ancillary activities such as customs clearance, warehousing, ground services, etc.) on behalf of customers according to their needs."
- Pour les activités de logistique ou general logistic services: "the part of the supply chain process that plans, implements and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customers' requirements."
51. Ces marchés ont été définis comme des marchés nationaux, malgré une tendance vers plus d'internationalisation.
52. Selon les informations transmises par le gouvernement belge, la part de marché d'IFB Logistics sur ces deux marchés est comprise entre 2 % et 5 %, ce qui s'expliquerait par la partie relativement faible des biens qui sont transportés par le transport combiné et le transport ferroviaire.
53. Cette estimation paraît crédible, si l'on compare le chiffre d'affaires d'IFB, qui a été de EUR […] millions en 2003, aux chiffres d'affaires des autres acteurs belges sur ce marché, qui ont eu en 2003 les chiffres d'affaires suivants en Belgique:
Entreprise | Chiffre d'affaires |
Hesse-Noordnatie | 485 millions EUR |
Danzas | 176 millions EUR |
Ziegler | 129 millions EUR |
Schenker | 156 millions EUR |
54. En ce qui concerne le marché des terminaux, il y a lieu d'opérer une distinction entre les terminaux continentaux et les terminaux maritimes.
55. En ce qui concerne les terminaux continentaux, la Commission a pris position sur la définition des marchés pertinents dans ses décisions COMP M 2632 "DEUTSCHE BAHN/ECT INTERNAIONAL/UNITED DEPOTS" et IV/M 1651 "MAERSK/SEA LAND" et IV/M.831 "PO/Nedlloyd".
56. Dans la décision COMP M 2632, la Commission a défini le marché de produit en cause comme le marché "für das Erbringen von Umschlagdienstleistungen im Containergüter-Hinterlandverkehr per Binnenschiff zwischen ARA-Häfen und deutschem Niederrhein/Ruhrgebiet", le marché géographique étant "die Containerterminals entlang des Niederrheins von Nijmeggen bis Köln". En d'autres mots, tous les terminaux du bas Rhin seraient le marché pertinent. Dans les décisions IV M 1651 et IV M 831, le marché géographique d'un port est défini comme suit: "Ports or groups of ports serve a particular hinterland or are used for transshipment to smaller ports. The geographic area they generally serve determines the geographic scope related to their services." Il s'en suit que le marché de produit est le marché du transbordement du fret, et que son étendue géographique couvre le hinterland d'un port donné.
57. Pour le cas d'espèce, on arrive donc à la conclusion que le marché de produit en cause peut être défini comme le marché des services de transbordement d'UTI du/vers le transport terrestre (route — chemin de fer — barge). Le marché géographique pertinent est au minimum la région d'Anvers et ses environs, éventuellement même la région des ports ARA.
58. Á part les terminaux continentaux d'IFB, les terminaux au moins trimodaux de Hesse-Noordnatie (Noordzeeterminal, Europaterminal) et P O Ports (Seaport terminal) offrent les services de transbordement d'UTI du/vers le transport terrestre (route — chemin de fer — barge). Ces terminaux sont bien plus importants en volumes d'UTI traités que les terminaux d'IFB. En 2004, Hesse-Noordnatie a traité 4,9 millions TEU, P O Ports 0,7 millions TEU, tandis qu'IFB a traité 0,4 millions TEU. Le part de marché d'IFB est donc d'environ 6,7 %.
59. Les deux terminaux maritimes dans lesquels IFB détient des participations n'ont que des parts de marchés marginales en Belgique et en France. IFB ne détient pas de participations dans des terminaux dans d'autres pays.
2.1.2. La SNCB
60. La SNCB a été créée par la loi belge du 23 juillet 1926 créant la Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Belges [7]. Depuis le 14 octobre 1992 [8], elle est une entreprise publique autonome et société anonyme de droit public [9]. Ainsi, la SNCB est soumise aux dispositions légales et réglementaires de droit commercial national qui sont applicables aux sociétés anonymes pour tout ce qui n'est pas expressément prévu par ou en vertu du titre premier de la loi du 21 mars 1991 portant réforme de certaines entreprises publiques économiques, précitée, ou en vertu d'une loi spécifique quelconque.
61. L'État belge a réformé la structure de la SNCB au 1er janvier 2005. Elle a été transformée en trois sociétés distinctes, à savoir:
- la SNCB Holding: une société "de type holding" qui détiendra des participations dans les deux autres sociétés;
- Infrabel, le gestionnaire de l'infrastructure ferroviaire;
- la nouvelle SNCB, l'entreprise ferroviaire.
62. L'objet social de la SNCB est défini à l'art. 1bis de la loi du 23 juillet 1926, précité, inséré par la loi du 1er août 1966 [10] et modifié par l'art. 155 de la loi du 21 mars 1991, précité, comme suit:
"(1) La société a pour objet le transport de voyageurs et de marchandises par chemin de fer."
"(2) La société peut, par elle-même ou par voie de participations à des organismes existants ou a créer, belges, étrangers ou internationaux, faire toutes opérations commerciales, industrielles ou financières se rapportant directement ou indirectement, en tout ou en partie, à son objet social ou qui seraient susceptibles d'en faciliter ou d'en favoriser la réalisation ou le développement."
"(3) Est notamment considéré comme susceptible de favoriser la réalisation de l'objet social, le fait de fabriquer et de vendre des biens ou des services ayant trait directement ou indirectement à l'activité ferroviaire."
63. Cet article a toujours été interprété de manière extensive par la jurisprudence et la doctrine belge. Selon les autorités belges, les activités d'IFB sont clairement couvertes par lui.
64. Les organes de gestion de la SNCB sont le Conseil d'administration, le Comité de direction et l'Administrateur délégué. Le Conseil d'administration est composé de 10 membres, y compris l'Administrateur délégué. Les administrateurs sont nommés par le Roi, par arrêté délibéré en Conseil des Ministres. Ils sont choisis, après une procédure ouverte, en fonction de la complémentarité de leurs compétences telle que l'analyse financière et comptable, les aspects juridiques, la connaissance du secteur du transport, l'expertise en matière de mobilité, la stratégie du personnel et les relations sociales. Une fois nommés, les membres du Conseil d'administration exercent leur mandat de manière indépendante, et ne doivent pas obéir aux instructions de quiconque.
65. Les membres du Comité de direction, à l'exception de l'Administrateur délégué, nommé par le Roi, sont nommés par le Conseil d'administration, qui en détermine aussi le nombre. Le Comité de direction forme un collège.
2.2 Les difficultés financières rencontrées par IFB
66. Au cours des exercices 2001 et 2002, IFB a enregistré des pertes considérables: Selon les comptes annuels de 2002 d'IFB, les pertes cumulées au 31 décembre 2002 s'élevaient à EUR 137 millions (dont EUR 25 millions reporté de 2001), ce qui avait pour résultat des fonds propres négatifs de EUR 84 millions. A la fin de l'exercice 2001, ses fonds propres s'étaient encore élevés à EUR 28 millions.
67. Toujours selon les comptes annuels de 2002, les pertes opérationnelles de l'exercice 2002, c'est-à-dire la différence entre les dépenses courantes et les revenues courantes, s'élevaient à 13,4 millions d'EUR. Il y a lieu d'analyser d'abord les raisons pour les difficultés financières, et de décrire ensuite la réaction de l'encadrement d'IFB et de la SNCB, ainsi que la réaction des créanciers privés d'IFB.
2.2.1. Les raisons pour les difficultés financières
68. La principale raison pour les difficultés financières d'IFB a été les difficultés financières rencontrées par ses participations en France dans le port de Dunkerque, qui ont obligé IFB à faire d'importantes provisions dans ses comptes annuels de 2001 et 2002.
69. De plus, les activités "IFB Logistics" et "IFB Terminals" réalisaient de légères pertes en 2001 et 2002.
2.2.2. La réaction de l'encadrement d'IFB et de la SNCB
70. Depuis 2000, IFB n'avait plus payé toutes les factures que la SNCB lui avait envoyées pour les prestations de service de train. En 2001 et surtout en 2002, IFB a continué cette pratique. La SNCB semble avoir toléré cette pratique. Ainsi, IFB se trouvait fin janvier 2003 avec des factures impayées de la SNCB d'une valeur totale de EUR 63 millions.
71. En réaction aux difficultés financières rencontrées par IFB, tant le conseil d'administration d'IFB que son actionnaire principal, la SNCB, sont devenus de plus en plus convaincus que la survie du groupe IFB à long terme impliquait une modification structurelle du plan de la gestion de l'entreprise.
72. Le 19 septembre 2002, l'administrateur délégué d'IFB a chargé deux réviseurs de rédiger un rapport spécial afin d'évaluer la situation financière de l'entreprise. Le 24 décembre 2002, l'Assemblée Générale extraordinaire des Actionnaires ("AGE") d'IFB a pris connaissance du fait que la SNCB, suite à la réunion du Conseil d'administration qui a eu lieu le 20 décembre 2002, était disposée à souscrire une augmentation de capital à raison de maximum EUR 80 millions afin de redresser la situation financière d'IFB, dont EUR 20 millions pour répondre aux besoins d'IFB en liquidités. Les deux conseils d'administration de la SNCB et d'IFB ont donc donné leur accord de principe à deux augmentations de capital — de EUR 60 millions en convertissant des créances de la SNCB sur IFB en capital et de EUR 20 millions en mettant à la disposition d'IFB des moyens en liquide — à souscrire par la SNCB afin d'assurer la continuité de l'activité d'IFB.
73. IFB et la SNCB ont conclu le 7 avril 2003 un "contrat cadre concernant la restructuration d'IFB" afin de mettre en œuvre ces augmentations de capital. Ce contrat, qui est un contrat de droit privé, prévoit deux volets: un volet "mesures de sauvetage" et un volet "mesures de restructuration".
74. Vu ces circonstances, le Conseil d'administration d'IFB, après concertation avec son actionnaire principal, la SNCB, a décidé de convoquer une AGE, comme prévu à l'article 633 du Code belge des Sociétés en cas de pertes au moins égales à la moitié du capital social. Lors de cette assemblée, réunie le 20 mai 2003, les actionnaires d'IFB ont pris connaissance du rapport spécial du conseil d'administration d'IFB, dans lequel le contrat cadre entre la SNCB et IFB a été décrit et dans lequel il a été proposé de poursuivre les activités d'IFB moyennant la mise en œuvre d'une restructuration. Sur cette base, les actionnaires d'IFB ont marqué leur accord avec la poursuite des activités d'IFB.
2.2.3. La réaction des créanciers privés d'IFB
75. IFB a obtenu de la part des banques d'affaires privées des prêts et des garanties bancaires. Selon les informations transmises par le gouvernement belge, les difficultés financières rencontrées par IFB n'a eu le moindre impact sur les relations entre IFB et les banques: Ces banques ont tous maintenu les conditions contractuellement prévues, sans exiger des garanties complémentaires à celles d'usage ou autres cautions ou sûretés. Toujours selon le gouvernement belge, elles ont toutes été disposées à accorder de nouveaux prêts à des conditions concurrentielles.
76. Au 31 décembre 2004, IFB avait les contrats de prêt suivants auprès des banques privées:
Objet du prêt | Banque | Année | Taux | Montant (en EUR) | Situation au 31.12.2004 (en EUR) |
[…] | […] | 1997 | [entre 2 et 6 %] | 328334,97 | […] |
[…] | […] | 1999 | [entre 2 et 6 %] | 1264930,18 | […] |
[…] | […] | 1999 | [entre 2 et 6 %] | 1611307,91 | […] |
[…] | […] | 2001 | [entre 2 et 6 %] | 4945476,00 | […] |
[…] | […] | 2003 | [entre 2 et 6 %] | 2000000,00 | […] |
Total | | | | 10150049,06 | 5550066,03 |
77. Le dernier contrat de prêt a été conclu en juillet 2003, donc après la conclusion de l'accord cadre entre IFB et la SNCB et après que les banques ont appris les difficultés financières d'IFB.
78. Les garanties bancaires dont disposait IFB au 31 décembre 2004 ont été les suivants:
Bénéficiaire de la garantie bancaire | Montant (en EUR) |
Service public Fédéral FINANCES Garantie Douanes et Accises | 2401220,64 |
Service public Fédéral FINANCES Garantie Différend fiscal | 1772817,63 |
Service Public Fédéral MOBILITE ET TRANSPORT Garantie Commissionnaire de transport | 111552,12 |
Autres garanties | 44767,12 |
79. Les lignes de crédit afférentes à ces garanties ont toutes été maintenues, sans modification des conditions contractuellement prévues.
2.3. Les dispositions principales du "contrat cadre entre la SNCB et IFB concernant la restructuration d'IFB"
80. Afin d'assurer la continuité d'IFB, la SNCB et IFB ont conclu le contrat cadre mentionné ci-dessus qui stipule que l'exécution des mesures proposées se fera en deux phases: dans une première phase, une série de mesures de sauvetage seront prises à l'égard d'IFB jusqu'au moment où un plan de restructuration pourra être mis en œuvre pour IFB; dans une deuxième phase, des mesures seraient élaborées dans le cadre d'un plan de restructuration touchant IFB, les mesures de sauvetage pouvant à cette occasion être converties en capital.
81. Dans le préambule du contrat, la SNCB confirme son intention de "donner son approbation à une augmentation de capital d'IFB à souscrire par la SNCB à concurrence d'environ 60 millions EUR en convertissant les créances de la SNCB sur IFB et en mettant à la disposition d'IFB un montant supplémentaire de 20 millions EUR, dont 5 millions EUR seraient libérés immédiatement."
82. L'article 2 du contrat cadre entre la SNCB et IFB prévoit deux volets, à savoir un volet "mesures de sauvetage" et un volet "mesures de restructuration".
2.3.1. Modalités et conditions d'octroi des mesures de sauvetage
83. Le premier volet de l'article 2 prévoit trois mesures de sauvetage:
(1) l'octroi d'une avance récupérable de EUR 5 millions;
(2) l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit d'un maximum de EUR 15 millions et
(3) l'octroi d'un délai de paiement provisoire portant sur les dettes d'IFB.
84. L'article 3 du contrat cadre stipule que le taux d'intérêt sur l'avance récupérable et les sommes prélevées sur la facilité de crédit sera au moins égal au taux d'intérêt de référence appliqué par la Commission européenne pour l'aide d'État [11]. Il prévoit aussi que les intérêts sont capitalisés. Leur paiement aura lieu au même moment que le paiement des créances dues.
85. L'avance et la facilité de crédit sont mises à disposition à titre provisoire afin de répondre aux besoins financiers urgents d'IFB et seront converties en capital dans le cadre du plan de restructuration à établir.
86. En ce qui concerne en particulier l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit d'un maximum de EUR 15 millions, IFB pourra imputer les créances de la SNCB vis-à-vis d'IFB facturées à partir du 1er janvier 2003 à l'exception d'une facture du 31 janvier 2003 d'un montant de EUR 8 millions.
87. L'octroi d'un délai de paiement provisoire porte sur toutes les dettes d'IFB qui étaient facturées au 31 décembre 2002, y compris la facture du 31 janvier 2003 d'un montant de EUR 8 millions, ainsi que les dettes dont le montant était certain et liquide au 31 décembre 2002, mais qui ne sont en général pas facturées. Le total des montants dus à la SNCB s'élevait à EUR 63 millions. En plus, le montant en question doit être augmenté d'un intérêt de retard conventionnel, fixé à [entre 1 et 2] pro mille par décade indivisible [12], ou d'un taux d'intérêt légal applicable. Les intérêts sont capitalisés, et seront payé au moment du paiement de la créance principale.
88. Les intérêts dus par IFB à la SNCB pour les dettes et la facilité de crédit étaient de 2,2 millions EUR en 2002, de 3, 9 millions EUR en 2003 et de 4,7 millions EUR en 2004. Le contrat cadre prévoit que le paiement des intérêts a lieu en même temps que le paiement des créances.
89. IFB a aussi renoncé, vis-à-vis de la SNCB, à la prescription de ses dettes. L'ensemble de ces mesures, à l'exception de l'avance récupérable, a été mis en œuvre dès la signature du contrat cadre, à savoir le 7 avril 2003. En ce qui concerne le délai de paiement, il avait de facto déjà été accordé avant la conclusion du contrat cadre, et formalisé par le contrat cadre.
2.3.2. Modalités et conditions d'octroi des mesures de restructuration
90. En ce qui concerne le deuxième volet de l'article 2 du contrat cadre, il prévoit que les "mesures de restructuration" seront développées par les conseils d'administration de la SNCB et de IFB et ensuite soumis à l'État belge pour approbation.
91. L'article 4 du contrat cadre, intitulé "modalités d'octroi du volet 'mesures de restructuration", est rédigé comme suit:
"Les Parties confirment leur intention de mettre à exécution les mesures suivantes pour autant qu'elles soient conformes à un plan de restructuration approuvé par leurs deux Conseils d'administration, par l'État belge et si nécessaire par la CE, et sous réserve d'approbation par les actionnaires d'IFB:
- La conversion en capital d l'avance récupérable d'un montant de 5 millions EUR
- La conversion en capital de la partie de facilité de crédit prélevée pour un montant maximum de 15 millions EUR […]
- La conversion en capital des dettes de […] 63 millions EUR
- Eventuellement et à condition que les deux parties soient d'accord à ce sujet, une augmentation de capital supplémentaire […]"
92. Le gouvernement belge a informé la Commission dans les réunions du 12 décembre 2003 et du 16 septembre 2005 ainsi que dans ses lettres du 13 janvier 2004, du 28 janvier 2005, du 25 mars 2005 et du 30 juin 2005 sur les détails prévus pour les mesures de restructuration, qui comprennent des mesures ad hoc entamées par IFB vis-à-vis de ses filiales exploitant des terminaux en France, un plan de restructuration pour la société IFB, ainsi qu'une augmentation de capital.
93. À ce jour, aucune de ces mesures n'a été mise en œuvre.
2.3.2.1. Les mesures ad hoc entamées par IFB vis-à-vis de ses filiales exploitant des terminaux en France
94. Comme expliqué ci-dessous, IFB a poursuivi une stratégie de désinvestissement pour ses filiales françaises. Cette politique est quasiment achevée (cf. ci-dessus la description des participations); elle a été accompagnée d'une dénonciation des lettres de confort.
2.3.2.2. Le plan de restructuration
95. IFB et la SNCB ont élaboré avec le consultant McKinsey un plan de restructuration pour IFB, qui garantit la viabilité économique à longue terme d'IFB. Ce plan de restructuration prévoit deux parties:
- Restructuration de l'activité "IFB Logistics";
- Restructuration de l'activité "IFB Terminals".
96. La mise en œuvre du plan de restructuration a commencé dès 2003, et sera achevée en 2005. Le plan de restructuration prévoyait qu'IFB réalisera des bénéfices opérationnels de 0,5 millions d'EUR en 2003 et de 0,8 millions d'EUR en 2004, après avoir réalisé des pertes opérationnelles de 13,4 millions d'EUR en 2002.: Le tableau suivant montre la répartition des bénéfices et des pertes entre les différentes activités prévue pour les années 2002 à 2004:
| 2002 | 2003 | 2004 |
Filiales | […] | […] | […] |
IFB Terminals | […] | […] | […] |
IFB Logistics | […] | […] | […] |
Total | - 13,4 | 0,5 | 0,8 |
97. Les résultats réalisés en 2003 étaient inférieurs aux prévisions, le résultat d'exploitation étant de — 2,9 millions d'euros. Cela était dû notamment aux pertes des filiales (pertes de […] millions d'euros au lieu d'un bénéfice de […] millions d'euros) et aux faibles bénéfices d'IFB Logistics (bénéfice de […] millions d'euros au lieu d'un bénéfice escompté de […] millions d'euros).
98. Les résultats réalisés en 2004 étaient supérieurs aux prévisions, le résultat d'exploitation étant un bénéfice de 5,7 millions d'euros. IFB Logistics y contribuait pour […] millions d'euros, IFB Terminals pour […] millions d'euros, et les filiales pour […] millions d'euros.
99. Le plan de restructuration prévoit aussi la nécessité de nouveaux investissements d'une hauteur de […] millions d'EUR. Il y a lieu de présenter de plus près les mesures de restructuration prévues dans les différents secteurs d'activités et le besoin pour de nouveaux investissements.
a) Restructuration de l'activité logistique
100. En ce qui concerne l'activité "IFB Logistics", le plan de restructuration prévoyait un bénéfice opérationnel de […] millions d'EUR en 2003, après des pertes de […] millions d'EUR en 2002. Pour y arriver, le plan prévoyait un total de neuf mesures qui devaient permettre de réaliser des économies de […] millions d'EUR. Suite à la réduction du volume du transport conventionnel, qui devrait entraîner des pertes de […] millions d'EUR, l'amélioration totale serait donc de […] millions d'EUR. Les neuf mesures repris dans le tableau suivant:
Mesures | Bénéfice |
1.Effet de la réduction de la charge salariale | […] millions |
2.Consultance et outsourcing | […] millions |
3.Réductions de valeur et amortissement exceptionnel | […] millions |
4.Cessation des branches non rentables du North European Network | […] millions |
5.Perte de volume de trafic conventionnel | […] millions |
6.Reprise de provisions entretien wagons | […] millions |
7.Croissance de l'intermodal | […] millions |
8.Révision du contrat Railbarge (augmentation des prix et reengineering produit) | […] millions |
9.Augmentation des commissions des représentations (agent) | […] millions |
10.Réduction des frais généraux | […] millions |
101. Pour l'essentiel, les mesures de restructuration consistaient donc dans une augmentation des prix, liée à un nouveau design des produits, des reprises des provisions et des amortissements exceptionnels, une réduction des coûts salariaux et frais généraux, ainsi qu' une cessation d'activités non rentables.
102. Dans l'activité "IFB Logistics", il a donc été prévu que la restructuration s'achèverait entre mi-2003 et mi-2004.
b) Restructuration de l'activité terminal
103. La restructuration de l'activité "IFB Terminal", en revanche, devrait prendre trois ans. Il a été prévu que cette activité réduirait ses pertes opérationnelles de […] millions d'EUR en 2002 à […] millions d'EUR en 2003 et […] millions d'EUR en 2004, avant de conclure l'année 2005 avec un bénéfice opérationnel de […] millions d'EUR. Pour y arriver, le plan de restructuration prévoyait les 8 mesures suivantes:
Mesures | Bénéfice |
1.Mainhub:Réduction du personnelAdaptations informatiquesRéduction des amortissements et reprise des provisionsAugmentation du nombre des manipulations | […] millions |
2.CirkeldijckRéduction des opérations du terrainVente des actifsLocation du terminalRéduction du volumeRéduction du personnel | […] millions |

4.Dry port MuizenRéduction de coûts de personnel grâce au nouveau système de surveillanceAugmentation de volume | […] millions |
5.SchijnpoortAugmentation de volumeRéduction de coût d'exploitation | […] millions |
6.RenoryVente d'un stackerArrêt de la solidarité financière d'IFB | […] millions |
7.Bressoux: Fermeture du terminal | […] millions |
104. Les mesures les plus importantes concernent donc les terminaux Mainhub, Cirkeldijck et Zomerweg. Ils seront expliqués plus en détail dans les paragraphes qui suivent.
105. Mainhub. Le Mainhub fera, dès le deuxième semestre 2003 jusqu'à fin 2005, l'objet d'une réorganisation intégrale, qui permettra, grâce notamment à des adaptations informatiques importantes, une réduction du personnel combinée avec une augmentation du nombre des manipulations. Cela permettra une meilleure utilisation de la capacité du terminal, qui n'a été utilisé qu'à la hauteur de […] % en 2002.
106. Cirkeldijck. Dans le terminal Cirkeldijck, IFB renforcera sa coopération avec Hesse NoordNatie (HNN). HNN reprendra les opérations de terrain, tandis que IFB maintient le planning et le chargement du transport ferroviaire. […].
107. Zomerweg. Le terminal Zomerweg sera transformé de terminal bimodal en terminal trimodal, avec le transfert de tout le trafic Railbarge vers ce terminal. Dans ce contexte, le terrain et le quai seront élargis, le terrain, l'entrée et les chemins seront adaptés, et des investissements en matériel seront nécessaires.
c) Besoin d'investissement
108. La restructuration de Mainhub ainsi que la restructuration de Zomerweg impliquent la nécessité de nouveaux investissements d'une hauteur de […] millions d'EUR chacun. En même temps, la vente de la grue portique du terminal Cirkeldijck permettra de réduire ce besoin à […] millions d'EUR au total.
2.3.2.3. L'augmentation du capital
109. Par lettre du 28 janvier 2005, le gouvernement belge a informé la Commission que l'encadrement d'IFB ainsi que l'encadrement de la SNCB estiment qu'il est nécessaire d'accompagner le plan de restructuration d'une augmentation de capital d'IFB, comme l'avait prévu le contrat cadre. Le montant nécessaire, légèrement revu à la hausse par rapport aux prévisions du contrat cadre, serait de 96,5 millions EUR.
110. L'augmentation de capital se déroulera comme suit: d'abord, les dettes d'IFB vis-à-vis de la SNCB, qui s'élèvent à 78 millions EUR, et les intérêts dus sur ces dettes, qui s'élèveront à 13,5 millions EUR à la fin de l'année 2005, seront converties en capital. L'origine de ces dettes sont les mesures de sauvetage 1 et 2, donc le délai de paiement ainsi que la facilité de crédit. Ensuite, la SNCB apportera le reste, c'est-à-dire 5 millions EUR, en nature. La procédure correspond donc à la procédure prévue à l'article 4 du contrat cadre.
111. L'apport en nature consiste dans la participation de la SNCB dans la société TRW. Cette participation s'élève, comme expliqué ci-dessus, à 47 %, IFB détenant déjà une participation de 0,9 % dans la société. TRW exploite des terminaux à Anvers, Zeebrugge, Oostende, Charleroi, Liège, Bruxelles, Etge, Genk et Muizen, et offre des trains de fret pour 11 pays de l'UE.
112. Le montant de l'augmentation de capital est plus élevé que ce qui avait été prévu lors de la conclusion du contrat cadre entre IFB et la SNCB, qui prévoyait une augmentation de capital de 80 millions EUR, mais moins élevé que la proposition du consultant McKinsey, qui dans le plan de restructuration tablait sur une augmentation de capital de 120 millions EUR.
113. Le gouvernement belge estime que cette augmentation de capital laisserait à IFB, après réduction du capital pour résorber les pertes reportées, des capitaux propres de 23,9 millions EUR, ce qui présenterait une structure de capital saine avec un rapport entre le financement par fonds propres et les dettes adapté aux activités d'IFB.
114. Le taux de solvabilité, c'est-à-dire le ratio capitaux propres/passif, d'IFB avant et après l'augmentation du capital est illustré par la table suivante:
| Situation au 30.06.2005 | Augmentation proposée | Situation après l'augmentation |
Capitaux propres | - 72,6 | 96,5 | 23,9 |
Provisions et impôts différés | 14,3 | | 14,3 |
Dettes | 125,6 | - 91,5 | 34,1 |
Total du passif | 67,3 | | 72,3 |
Taux de solvabilité | | | 33 % [13] |
115. L'augmentation du capital est prévue pour le deuxième semestre 2005, après approbation par la Commission européenne et le Conseil d'Administration de la SNCB.
116. Contrairement à ce qui était prévu à l'article 4 du contrat cadre, le plan pour l'augmentation du capital n'a pas été soumis au gouvernement belge pour approbation. Le gouvernement belge estime qu'une telle approbation n'est pas nécessaire, car il s'agit d'une décision purement commerciale de la SNCB, que cette dernière peut prendre sans approbation par l'État.
2.4. Développement financier d'IFB depuis la conclusion du contrat cadre
117. La situation économique et financière d'IFB s'est améliorée substantiellement depuis la conclusion du contrat cadre en avril 2003. Ainsi, le résultat d'exploitation a connu une évolution positive de — 47,36 millions EUR en 2002 à 5,74 millions EUR en 2004. Le résultat de l'exercice avant impôts s'est amélioré de — 109,76 millions EUR en 2002 à 13,21 millions EUR en 2004.
118. Le tableau suivant donne un aperçu du développement des principaux indicateurs économiques et financiers d'IFB:

Capitaux propres | (84068) | (85277) | (83941) | (77775) | (74850) |
119. L'amélioration de la situation économique et financière est due d'un côté à la réalisation du plan de restructuration, de l'autre à la poursuite de la stratégie de désinvestissement en ce qui concerne les participations.
120. Dans le premier semestre 2005, IFB a continué à enregistrer des bénéfices: le résultat d'exploitation était de 1,6 millions EUR, le résultat avant impôt de 2,2 millions EUR.
2.4.1. La mise en œuvre du plan de restructuration
121. Pour la mise en œuvre du plan de restructuration, il faut distinguer entre les mesures qui affectent l'ensemble des activités d'IFB, et les mesures spécifiques à IFB Logistics et IFB Terminals.
2.4.1.1. Mesures qui affectent l'ensemble des activités d'IFB
122. La conclusion d'une nouvelle convention de travail au niveau de l'entreprise et la modification du règlement de travail ont permis d'atteindre un taux d'activité plus élevé (le nombre de jours à prester par an a augmenté) à des coûts inférieurs (la rémunération pour le travail de week-end et celle pour le travail d'équipe a été réduite). Les services administratifs et commerciaux ont été centralisés à Berchem, ce qui a permis de fermer l'établissement à Gand et de réduire la capacité de celui de Zeebruges.
123. Ces mesures ont contribué à limiter le personnel nécessaire et à baisser les frais généraux.
2.4.1.2. Mesures spécifiques à IFB Terminals
124. En plus des mesures prévues par le plan de restructuration deux mesures ont été prises: Pour le terminal de Cirkeldijck, le prix de manutention a été revu à la hausse. En général, les trafics ont été analysés et, par la suite, réorientés en concertation avec les clients.
125. L'ensemble des mesures, ainsi que la croissance des volumes manutentionnés, ont permis à IFB Terminals de re-devenir rentable dès 2004, avec un bénéfice avant impôts de […] EUR, après des pertes avant impôts de […] millions EUR en 2003. L'objectif fixé par le plan de restructuration a donc été plus que respecté (pour rappel: le plan de restructuration prévoyait des pertes de […] EUR.)
2.4.1.3. Mesures spécifiques à IFB Logistics
126. En plus des mesures prévues par le plan de restructuration, IFB Logistics a réalisé une analyse profonde de ses produits ferroviaires, qui a révélé l'existence de produits non rentables, qu'IFB a arrêté de produire depuis.
127. Pour d'autres produits, cette analyse a démontré la nécessité d'améliorations sur le plan technique. Ces améliorations ont été faites, notamment pour le secteur du transport intermodal des conteneurs.
128. L'ensemble des mesures a permis à IFB Logistics de re-devenir rentable dès 2003, avec un bénéfice avant impôts de […] EUR. En 2004, le résultat a encore été amélioré à […] millions EUR. IFB Logistics n'a donc pas pu atteindre l'objectif fixé par le plan de restructuration pour 2003 ([…] millions EUR), mais a pu l'atteindre en 2004 (l'objectif était de […] millions EUR).
2.5. Budget
129. Le montant prévisionnel total des mesures de sauvetage s'élève à maximum EUR 78 millions [14].
130. Le montant total de l'augmentation de capital prévu s'élève à 96,5 millions EUR, dont 78 millions EUR résulteront de la conversion des dettes existantes (63 millions) et des mesures de sauvetage (15 millions) en capital, et 13,5 millions EUR de la conversion des intérêts capitalisés en capital. 5 millions EUR supplémentaires seront apportés par la SNCB en nature, par le transfert de la participation de la SNCB dans TRW à IFB.
2.6. Mise à disposition des ressources financières et durée
131. Dans ses lettres du 28 janvier 2005 et du 25 mars 2005, le gouvernement belge explique que les mesures 2 (facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euro) et 3 (délai de payement pour les dettes existantes de 63 millions d'euro) du volet "mesures de sauvetage" ont été mises en œuvre par la SNCB et IFB à partir du 7 avril 2003. En revanche, IFB n'a pas eu besoin de l'avance récupérable prévue par la mesure 1.
132. Le contrat cadre prévoit que, sauf conversion en capital dans le cadre d'un éventuel plan de restructuration approuvé ou de toute autre mesure comparable convenue, les sommes majorées des intérêts sont remboursables douze mois après avoir été effectivement mises à la disposition d'IFB par la SNCB. L'encadrement d'IFB et de la SNCB ayant convenu du principe d'une augmentation de capital, ils considèrent que le contrat de prêt a été tacitement prolongé jusqu'à ce que l'augmentation du capital ait lieu. IFB continue en attendant d'accumuler les intérêts prévus par le contrat cadre, à savoir un intérêt de retard conventionnel, fixé à [entre 1 et 2] pro mille par décade indivisible [15], ou un taux d'intérêt légal applicable. Le taux moyen des intérêts est de [entre 3,6 et 7,2] %. La totalité des intérêts devra être payée au moment du paiement de la créance, ou sera convertie en capital social.
133. L'augmentation de capital est prévue pour le deuxième semestre 2005, après son approbation par la Commission.
3. APPRÉCIATION
3.1. Evaluation du caractère d'aide des mesures de sauvetage et de restructuration
134. Selon l'article 87, paragraphe 1, du traité, "sont incompatibles avec le marché commun, dans la mesure où elles affectent les échanges entre Etats membres, les aides accordées par les Etats ou au moyen de ressources de l'État sous quelque forme que ce soit qui faussent ou menacent de fausser la concurrence en favorisant certaines entreprises ou certaines productions".
3.1.1. Accordée par l'État ou au moyen de ressources de l'État
135. Il se pose donc d'abord la question de savoir si le soutien financier de la SNCB à IFB a été "accordées par les Etats ou au moyen de ressources de l'État". Selon la jurisprudence Stardust Marine de la CJCE [16], ce critère est rempli si d'une part il s'agit de ressources d'Etat et si d'autre part l'octroi de ceux-ci est imputable à l'État en question, à savoir la Belgique.
3.1.1.1. Ressources d'État
136. En ce qui concerne l'aspect "fonds publics", la Commission constate que la SNCB est qualifiable d'entreprise publique au sens de l'article 2 de la Directive de la Commission 2000/52/CE [17]: l'État belge détient 100 % du capital souscrit de la SNCB, et le Conseil d'administration, ainsi que l'administrateur délégué, sont nommés par le Roi, par arrêté délibéré en Conseil des Ministres. Ainsi, et le critère a) et le critère c) à l'alinéa 2 de l'article 2 de la Directive sont remplis.
137. Dans ce contexte, "… il convient de rappeler qu'il découle déjà de la jurisprudence de la Cour que l'article 87, paragraphe 1, CE englobe tous les moyens pécuniaires que les autorités publiques peuvent effectivement utiliser pour soutenir des entreprises, sans qu'il soit pertinent que ces moyens appartiennent ou non de manière permanente au patrimoine de l'État. En conséquence, même si les sommes correspondant à la mesure en cause ne sont pas de façon permanente en possession du Trésor public, le fait qu'elles restent constamment sous contrôle public, et donc à la disposition des autorités nationales compétentes, suffit pour qu'elles soient qualifiées de ressources d'État. " [18]
138. En conséquence, la Commission estime que les sommes mises à la disposition d'IFB sont à qualifier de ressources d'État.
3.1.1.2. Imputabilité
3.1.1.3. En ce qui concerne le critère de l'imputabilité des mesures à l'État concerné, l'arrêt Stardust Marine stipule que "…le seul fait qu'une entreprise publique soit sous contrôle étatique ne suffit pas pour imputer des mesures prises par celle-ci, telles que les mesures de soutien financier en cause, à l'État. Il est encore nécessaire d'examiner si les autorités publiques doivent être considérées comme ayant été impliquées, d'une manière ou d'une autre, dans l'adoption de ces mesures. …. [19]"
139. Il ressort donc de la jurisprudence de la Cour que le critère de l'imputabilité à l'État doit faire l'objet d'un examen au cas par cas par la Commission. La Cour admet qu'en règle générale, "… il sera très difficile pour un tiers, précisément à cause des relations privilégiées existant entre l'État et une entreprise publique, de démontrer dans un cas concret que des mesures d'aide prises par une telle entreprise ont effectivement été adoptées sur instruction des autorités publiques. A cet égard, il ne saurait être exigé qu'il soit démontré, sur le fondement d'une instruction précise, que les autorités publiques ont incité concrètement l'entreprise publique à prendre les mesures d'aide en cause" [20]. Pour ces motifs, selon la même jurisprudence, "…il y a lieu d'admettre que l'imputabilité à l'État d'une mesure d'aide prise par une entreprise peut être déduite d'un ensemble d'indices résultant des circonstances de l'espèce et du contexte dans lequel cette mesure est intervenue."
140. Dans le cas d'espèce, il faut distinguer, en ce qui concerne l'imputabilité, entre la période avant la conclusion du contrat cadre le 7 avril 2003 et la période après.
141. En ce qui concerne la période avant la conclusion du contrat cadre, il se pose la question de savoir si la décision de la SNCB de ne pas demander le paiement des sommes pour les prestations de service de transport à partir de 2000 est imputable à l'État belge.
142. La Commission ne dispose d'aucune information sur la question de savoir comment et pourquoi la SNCB a décidé de ne pas demander le paiement de ses factures dues. Puisque le non paiement des factures semble avoir été systématique dans la période fin 2000 jusque début 2003, la Commission a cependant des doutes qu'une telle décision aurait pu être prise par l'encadrement moyen de l'entreprise. Il semble que les auditeurs de l'entreprise ont dû le constater et alerter l'encadrement supérieur, et éventuellement aussi le commissaire du gouvernement en charge de la SNCB. La Commission exprime donc à ce stade des doutes si la décision de la SNCB de ne plus demander le paiement de ses factures à IFB à partir de fin 2000 a été imputable à l'État belge, et invite les autorités belges à lui fournir tout élément utile pour établir comment cette décision a été prise.
143. En ce qui concerne la période après la conclusion du contrat cadre, l'analyse du dossier par la Commission a relevé trois indices concrets pour une imputabilité des mesures de sauvetage et de restructuration en faveur d'IFB à l'État belge:
- La soumission du plan de restructuration à l'approbation par l'État belge
- Les articles de presse démontrant une forte influence du gouvernement belge sur la SNCB pendant l'année 2003
- L'ampleur, le contenu et les conditions du contrat cadre
a) L'approbation par les autorités publiques
144. Dans ses arrêts Van der Kooy [21], Italie/Commission [22] et Commission/France [23], la Cour a déduit l'imputabilité de l'aide du fait que l'octroi de l'aide ait été sujet à l'approbation par les autorités publiques. Dans l'arrêt Van der Kooy, cet élément suffit à lui seul pour établir l'imputabilité; dans les arrêts Italie/Commission et Commission/France, l'approbation est combinée avec d'autres éléments qui montrent l'influence des pouvoirs publics [24]. La récente décision Space Park Development GmbH, qui a été la première décision de la Commission appliquant l'arrêt Stardust Marine, a déduit l'imputabilité d'une aide également du fait que le prêt en question devait recevoir l'agrément des autorités du Land de Brême [25]. Par conséquent, la soumission d'une mesure à l'État membre pour approbation constitue un indice pour l'imputabilité.
145. Dans le présent dossier, l'article 2 du contrat cadre oblige les Conseils d'administration de la SNCB et d'IFB de soumettre le plan de restructuration pour approbation par l'État belge. Cela constitue un indice supplémentaire de l'imputabilité des décisions de la SNCB dans le présent cas à l'État belge.
146. Le gouvernement belge a informé la Commission entre-temps que, à la différence de ce qui a été prévu dans le contrat cadre, la SNCB et IFB n'ont pas soumis le plan de restructuration à l'approbation du gouvernement belge, car cela aurait violé l'autonomie commerciale de la SNCB.
147. La Commission considère que cela n'a pas pour conséquence de rendre cet indice d'imputabilité inopérant: il paraît exclu que les deux parties au contrat, la SNCB et IFB, aient inclus une telle clause dans le contrat, s'il n'y avait pas une prise d'influence du gouvernement belge dans ce sens. Dès lors, le fait que le gouvernement belge n'ait pas insisté à être formellement consulté sur la mise en œuvre de la restructuration ne suffit pas pour exclure une prise d'influence informelle de la part du gouvernement belge lors de la préparation du contrat cadre, qui contient déjà les grandes lignes du sauvetage et de la restructuration.. En tout état de cause, le fait que l'État belge ait omis d'utiliser des moyens de contrôle dont il disposait ne signifie pas que la mesure ne lui soit pas imputable.
b) Articles de presse
148. Des indices pour une intervention du gouvernement belge dans la présente affaire se trouvent aussi dans des articles de presse [26]. Ainsi, un article paru dans La libre Belgique du 19 Mai 2003 [27] cite la cellule presse de la SNCB, qui explique que la Belgique n'avait pas encore notifié les mesures de sauvetage à la Commission le 19 mai 2003, tandis que le contrat cadre avait été signé le 7 avril 2003, par le fait que "le pouvoir fédéral a[vait] son mot à dire ". Dans un article paru en mars 2003 dans www.cheminots.be, Karel Vinck, à l'époque administrateur délégué de la SNCB, est cité à propos des dossiers ABX et IFB comme suit: "Il réclame une marge de manœuvre suffisante pour le management de la société". Cela laisse sous-entendre que l'encadrement de la SNCB considérait que l'État intervenait trop dans ces affaires.
c) Ampleur, contenu, conditions du contrat cadre
149. De manière plus générale, la Commission rappelle que, selon le point 56 de l'arrêt Stardust Marine, précité, "tout autre indice indiquant, dans le cas concret, une implication des autorités publiques ou l'improbabilité d'une absence d'implication dans l'adoption d'une mesure, eu égard également à l'ampleur de celle-ci, à son contenu ou aux conditions qu'elle comporte" doit être pris en compte pour établir l'imputabilité d'une mesure à l'État membre en question. S'agissant en l'espèce d'importantes mesures de restructuration, qui devaient être conditionnées par l'approbation des autorités belges, la Commission considère que l'ampleur, le contenu et les conditions du contrat cadre constituent dans ce cas concret des indices supplémentaires d'imputabilité.
d) Conclusion
150. Par conséquent, la Commission considère, à ce stade, que le soutien financier est imputable à l'État belge en ce qui concerne la période après la conclusion du contrat cadre. Il faut donc analyser si l'aide a conféré un avantage au bénéficiaire, ou si, au contraire, la Belgique a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché.
3.1.2. Soutien financier favorisant certaines entreprises
151. S'il s'avère que la décision de la SNCB de ne plus demander le paiement de ses factures à IFB à partir de fin 2000 est imputable à la Belgique, il faudrait analyser si ce soutien aurait était accordé par un investisseur privé en économie de marché.
152. La décision de la SNCB de signer le contrat cadre avec IFB étant imputable à la Belgique, il faut ensuite analyser si la SNCB, en accordant à IFB d'abord un financement de sauvetage et ensuite à un financement de la restructuration, a favorisé IFB par rapport à d'autres entreprises. Tel n'est pas le cas si la SNCB a agi, vis-à-vis d'IFB, comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé/un créditeur avisé en économie de marché. Pour effectuer cette deuxième appréciation, il y a lieu de distinguer entre les mesures de sauvetage et les mesures de restructuration.
3.1.2.1. Le non-paiement des factures de la SNCB par IFB entre 2000 et 2003
153. En ce qui concerne le non-paiement des factures de la SNCB par IFB, il faut vérifier si un créancier avisé aurait accepté, à la place de la SNCB, qu'IFB ne paye pas ses factures, ou si un créancier avisé aurait entamé, à la place de la SNCB, une procédure en justice, pour obtenir le paiement de ses factures.
154. À ce titre, il y a d'abord lieu de relever qu'il est une pratique commerciale courante d'accorder à un client qui connaît des problèmes de liquidités momentanés, mais qui est pour le reste en bonne santé économique, un délai de paiement tacite pour ses factures, en attendant le paiement plutôt que de l'assigner tout de suite en justice.
155. Il semble que les difficultés financières de l'entreprise ne sont devenues apparentes que dans le courant de l'année 2002 (voir description de la situation financière ci-dessus). Le fait qu'IFB ait obtenu un prêt de plus de 4 millions EUR de la part de la banque commerciale […] en 2001 à un taux de marché, et que les fonds propres d'IFB étaient de 28 millions EUR à la fin de l'année 2001 pointent aussi dans cette direction.
156. Cependant, la Commission ne peut pas exclure à ce stade que la SNCB en tant que société mère d'IFB aurait du se rendre compte des problèmes d'IFB plus en amont, durant l'année 2001.
157. C'est donc au plus tôt à partir de 2001 qu'un investisseur privé aurait agi de manière plus prudente. Il est difficile de dire à partir de quand un créancier privé aurait cherché à obtenir un remboursement de ses créances ou des sécurités additionnelles; à ce stade, la Commission considère que ce moment était venu au plus tard le 19 septembre 2002, quand l'administrateur délégué d'IFB a chargé deux réviseurs de rédiger un rapport spécial sur la situation financière d'IFB.
158. Ce processus a mené au développement du contrat cadre, qui prévoit explicitement des mesures de sauvetage et de restructuration. En continuant à fournir à IFB des prestations de transport par chemin de fer, la SNCB a accordé au plus tôt courant 2001 et au plus tard depuis le 19 septembre 2002 des avantages économiques à IFB, qui doivent être considéré comme des aides d'État. En ne poursuivant pas IFB devant la justice afin d'obtenir le paiement des factures datant de 2000 et de 2001 au plus tard à partir de ce moment, la SNCB a aussi accordé un avantage à IFB en ce qui concerne le non-paiement de ces factures.
159. La SNCB a donc accordé de facto une aide à IFB au plus tôt depuis 2001, au plus tard depuis le 19 septembre 2002; cette aide n'a été que formalisée par le contrat cadre.
3.1.2.2. Les mesures de sauvetage
160. Les mesures de sauvetage ont été décrites ci-dessus dans la partie 2. Pour rappel, il s'agissait de:
- l'octroi d'un délai de paiement pour des dettes de 63 millions d'euros;
- l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros;
- l'octroi d'une avance récupérable de 5 millions d'euros.
161. Parmi ces mesures, il y a lieu de distinguer entre les actions que la SNCB a prises en tant que créancier d'IFB, à savoir l'octroi du délai de paiement pour les dettes déjà existantes de 63 millions d'euros, et les actions que la SNCB a pris en tant qu'investisseur en IFB, à savoir l'octroi d'une nouvelle facilité de crédit de 15 millions EUR et l'octroi d'une nouvelle avance récupérable de 5 millions EUR.
162. Comme l'explique l'avocat général Poiares Maduro, "le critère du créancier privé ne doit pas être confondu avec celui […] de l'investisseur privé. Tandis que l'investisseur prétend réaliser un bénéfice en intervenant auprès des entreprises concernées, le créancier cherche à obtenir le paiement des sommes qui lui sont dues par un débiteur connaissant des difficultés financières. […] Dans ce cas, le critère décisif n'est donc pas de savoir s'il existe un avantage économique, mais de savoir si cet avantage correspond à un traitement plus favorable que celui qui serait accordé, dans des conditions similaires, par un créancier privé à son entreprise débitrice" [28].
163. Il y a donc lieu d'analyser dans la suite d'abord si la Belgique a agi comme un créancier avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne l'octroi du délai de paiement, et ensuite si la Belgique a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne l'octroi de la facilité de crédit et de l'avance récupérable.
a) La SNCB a-t-elle agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier avisé en économie de marché en accordant le délai de paiement ?
164. Selon le Tribunal, il faut comparer le comportement de l'État à celui d'"un créancier privé cherchant à obtenir le paiement des sommes qui lui sont dues par un débiteur connaissant des difficultés financières" [29]. La décision à laquelle le créancier SNCB était confronté dans le cas d'espèce était donc de déterminer si un créancier avisé aurait préféré mettre IFB en faillite plutôt que de lui accorder un délai de paiement.
165. Le contrat cadre a été signé le 7 avril 2003, mais des délais de paiement pouvant constituer des aides d'État avaient été accordés dès 2001. Il faut placer l'analyse sous l'angle des faits connus de la SNCB à ce moment [30].
166. Pour l'année 2002, IFB avait enregistré des pertes d'exploitation d'EUR 47,4 millions, dont 34 millions étaient des dépréciations spécifiques déjà constatées au niveau des charges d'exploitation, et des pertes exceptionnelles de EUR 59,369 millions. Les pertes exceptionnelles étaient surtout dues à des moins-values dans un certain nombre de filiales, principalement françaises. A cause de ces pertes, IFB avait des fonds propres négatifs de EUR 84,07 millions à la fin de l'exercice 2002.
167. Dans l'hypothèse d'une faillite, la SNCB, qui détenait 89,03 % du capital social de l'IFB, n'aurait eu éventuellement accès aux résultats de la liquidation qu'après satisfaction des créanciers. De plus, ses créances découlant des factures non payées n'auraient probablement été satisfaites qu'en partie.
168. C'est d'ailleurs pour cela que, dans ses comptes annuels de 2002, la SNCB avait mis la valeur des ces titres et créances à zéro, [31] au motif que, "compte tenu de la situation financière de ce groupe [i.e. IFB] et dans l'attente d'une finalisation du plan de restructuration de ce groupe au sein du secteur fret de la SNCB, les créances commerciales et les commandes en cours que la SNCB possède [doivent être] comptabilisées comme douteuses." [32].
169. La SNCB était de loin le créancier le plus important d'IFB à ce moment: selon les comptes annuels d'IFB de 2003, IFB avait des dettes auprès des établissements de crédit de 12 millions d'euros, et des dettes vis-à-vis ses fournisseurs, donc principalement vis-à-vis de la SNCB, de 108 millions d'euros.
170. Dans l'hypothèse d'une faillite, la SNCB aurait aussi dû réintégrer 50 employés, qui avaient été détachés à IFB, au sein de l'entreprise. Dans un contexte où la SNCB essaie de réduire le nombre de ses employés, cela aurait constitué un désavantage supplémentaire pour la SNCB.
171. En conclusion, la mise en faillite d'IFB aurait engendré des coûts supplémentaires pour la SNCB, sans qu'elle ait la certitude de voir ses créances honorées.
172. Cependant, il se pose la question de savoir si l'alternative, à savoir l'octroi du délai de paiement, accompagnée du paiement des intérêts moratoires au taux légal ou au taux de marché (selon les dettes, cf. description ci-dessus), d'un engagement de ne pas invoquer la prescription des créances et de nouveaux investissements, permettait à la SNCB de raisonnablement s'attendre à ce qu'IFB une rentabilité suffisante pour rémunérer ses nouveaux investissements à un niveau acceptable pour un investisseur privé en économie de marché et pour améliorer les perspectives de satisfaction des créances antérieures à moyen ou longue terme.
173. En avril 2003, au moment de la conclusion du contrat cadre, IFB avait commencé sa restructuration, qui impliquait d'un côté une restructuration en profondeur des opérations d'IFB lui-même, d'un autre côté une stratégie de désinvestissement pour endiguer les pertes opérationnelles des filiales françaises, comme décrit ci-dessus dans la partie 2.3.2.
174. En ce qui concerne les chances pour un retour à la rentabilité économique d'IFB, force est de constater que les difficultés financières étaient notamment dues à sa stratégie d'expansion en France, et seulement dans une moindre mesure à des problèmes structurels de IFB Logistics et IFB Terminals..
175. Cependant, le contrat cadre prévoit que le délai de paiement soit accompagné d'une facilité de crédit de 15 millions EUR et d'une avance récupérable de 5 millions EUR. Afin de pouvoir raisonnablement s'attendre aux paiements des créances, la SNCB devait donc investir de capital frais. Dès lors, un investisseur privé n'aurait accordé un délai de paiement que si son investissement additionnel de 20 millions de capital frais constituait un investissement avec un rendement acceptable.
176. Le délai de paiement doit donc être analysé ensemble avec les décisions d'investissement prises par la SNCB dans le contrat cadre, car les mesures forment un ensemble au sens de la jurisprudence BP Chemicals [33].
b) La SNCB a-t-elle agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en accordant l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit et l'octroi d'une avance récupérable?
177. En ce qui concerne l'octroi de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'EUR, et l'octroi de l'avance récupérable de 5 millions d'EUR, la SNCB n'agissant pas en tant qu'investisseur n'était pas un créancier d'IFB, mais avait le libre choix d'investir cet argent dans IFB ou bien ailleurs, et était donc un investisseur.
178. Il convient donc d'analyser si la SNCB a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché. Selon la jurisprudence de la Cour, il y a lieu d'apprécier si, dans des circonstances similaires, un investisseur privé d' une taille qui puisse être comparée à celle de la SNCB aurait pu être amené à procéder aux apports de capitaux de cette importance [34].
179. La Cour a précisé que si le comportement de l' investisseur privé, auquel doit être comparée l'intervention de l'investisseur public poursuivant des objectifs de politique économique, n'est pas nécessairement celui de l'investisseur ordinaire plaçant des capitaux en vue de leur rentabilisation à plus ou moins court terme, il doit, au moins, être celui d' un holding privé ou d' un groupe privé d' entreprises poursuivant une politique structurelle, globale ou sectorielle, et guidé par des perspectives de rentabilité à plus long terme [35]. Le Tribunal a défini de manière plus précise la méthode d'évaluation à suivre par la Commission. Il a précisé que la Commission est obligée "de faire une analyse complète de tous les éléments pertinents de l'opération litigieuse et de son contexte" afin de savoir si l'État a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché [36].
180. Il faut donc établir, dans le cas d'espèce, la rentabilité de l'intervention de la SNCB, ce qui suppose de regarder si l'investissement dans IFB devait dégager une marge bénéficiaire normale.
181. La SNCB a, à travers les mesures de sauvetage, décidé de mobiliser en avril 2003 20 millions d'EUR dans la société IFB, sous forme de prêt (facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et avance récupérable de 5 millions d'euros).
182. Le contrat cadre, qui accordait les mesures de sauvetage, a été conclu le 7 avril 2003. En ce qui concerne l'investissement de 20 millions d'EUR fait à ce moment au titre de mesure de sauvetage, leur analyse doit donc être placée sous l'angle des faits connus de la SNCB à ce moment [37].
183. Généralement, pour déterminer si un taux d'intérêt pour un prêt correspond aux conditions normales du marché, la Commission établit une comparaison avec la valeur, à la même date, du taux de référence fixé pour l'État membre considéré [38]. Les prêts en espèces étant rémunérés au taux de marché et en partie même à un taux supérieur au taux de marché, il semble de prime abord ne pas y avoir un élément d'aide. Cependant, il faut constater qu'IFB était, au moment de l'octroi des prêts, une entreprise confrontée à de très graves difficultés financières. Il semble invraisemblable qu'il aurait pu obtenir, sur le marché de capital, un prêt à des conditions comparables à celles offertes par la SNCB. Une banque aurait donc très probablement demandé un taux de rémunération supérieur au taux demandé par la SNCB ou aurait même refuser d'octroyer un prêt à IFB. D'ailleurs, la décision de la SNCB d'accorder un délai de paiement sur ses créances existantes est un indice de la difficulté que devait rencontrer IFB à se refinancer ailleurs.
184. Les autorités belges considèrent que le fait qu'IFB ait obtenu en juillet 2003, donc après la conclusion du contrat cadre, un prêt sur 2 millions EUR de la part de la banque ING démontre que les banques privées ne demandaient pas une rémunération supérieure au taux de marché.
185. Cet argument n'est pas convaincant, pour deux raisons. D'abord, le montant de 2 millions EUR est très faible comparé aux engagements de la SNCB, qui prévoyaient des investissements de 20 millions EUR ainsi que la possibilité de convertir les créances de 63 millions EUR en capital. Ensuite, ING n'a accordé ce prêt qu'après que la SNCB s'était engagée de garantir la survie d'IFB, en signant le contrat cadre.
186. Dès lors, force est de constater que la SNCB, en accordant les prêts à un taux inférieur au taux qui aurait été adéquat pour la situation financière d'IFB, n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché.
187. Le gouvernement belge considère pour sa part que la SNCB a agi comme l'aurait fait toute société mère, dont une filiale est en difficulté, sans préciser davantage cet argument. La Commission observe à cet égard que la Belgique n'a pas démontré cet argument et en particulier, n'a pas démontré que le nouvel investissement était nécessaire pour pouvoir espérer en retirer un montant supérieur à l'ensemble de ses créances existantes et nouvelles.
c) Conclusion en ce qui concerne les mesures de sauvetage
188. En conclusion, la Commission considère, à ce stade, que la SNCB n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne l'octroi de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et en ce qui concerne l'octroi de l'avance récupérable de 5 millions d'euros. Puisque l'octroi du délai de paiement n'était raisonnable pour un créancier privé que si l'investissement l'était aussi, il s'ensuit que la SNCB n'a pas non plus agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne l'octroi d'un délai de paiement pour IFB.
3.1.2.3. Les mesures de restructuration
189. Les mesures de restructuration ont été décrites ci-dessus dans la partie 2. Pour rappel, il s'agissait de:
- La conversion des dettes de 63 millions d'euros pour lesquelles un délai de paiement a été octroyé en capital social.
- La conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros en capital social.
- La conversion des intérêts sur le délai de paiement capitalisés de 11 millions d'euros en capital social.
- La conversion des intérêts sur l'avance récupérable capitalisés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social.
- L'injection de 5 millions d'euros par l'apport en nature de la participation de la SNCB dans TRW.
190. En total, l'augmentation de capital sera donc de 96,5 millions d'euros. IFB ayant en ce moment des fonds propres négatifs de 72,6 millions d'euros, l'augmentation de capital lui laissera des capitaux propres de 23,8 millions d'euros.
191. Parmi ces mesures, il y a lieu de distinguer entre les actions que la SNCB a pris en tant que créancier d'IFB, à savoir la conversion des dettes existantes de 63 millions d'euros et des intérêts liés de 11 millions d'euros en capital social, et les actions que la SNCB a pris en tant qu'investisseur en IFB, à savoir la conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions EUR et des intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social et l'injection de capital frais de 5 millions EUR.
192. En ce qui concerne la conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions en capital social, il pourrait être objecté qu'au moment de la conversion, la SNCB n'était plus un investisseur, mais un créancier. Cela ignore cependant le fait qu'il était prévu dans le contrat cadre de convertir éventuellement la facilité de crédit en capital social (voir description dans la partie 2), et que la facilité de crédit n'était qu'une mesure temporaire. Dès lors, il faut considérer que la conversion de la facilité de crédit en capital social doit être comparée à un investissement.
a) La SNCB a-t-elle agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier avisé en économie de marché en convertissant ses créances de 63 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 11 millions d'euros en capital social?
193. En convertissant ses créances de 63 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 11 millions d'euros en capital social, la SNCB renonce au paiement de ses dettes. En contrepartie, elle aura droit aux dividendes qu'IFB payera à ses propriétaires, et acquiert des parts sociales.
194. Comme démontré ci-dessus, il y a lieu de considérer, à ce stade, qu'un créancier privé avisé n'aurait pas accordé le délai de paiement accordé par la SNCB, mais il aurait mis IFB en faillite et aurait essayer d'obtenir le paiement des créances dans le cadre de la procédure collective.
195. Dès lors, un créancier privé avisé n'aurait pas non plus converti ses créances en capital social d'une entreprise qui ne pouvait survivre que s'il injectait en même du capital frais. La SNCB n'a donc pas agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier privé en économie de marché en convertissant ses créances en capital social.
b) La SNCB a-t-elle agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en convertissant la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social, et en injectant des capitaux frais de 5 millions d'euros?
196. Il convient d'analyser si la SNCB a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne la conversion en capital social de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et des intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros ainsi que l'augmentation de capital d'IFB à l'hauteur de 5 millions d'EUR.
197. Selon la jurisprudence de la Cour, il y a lieu d'apprécier si, dans des circonstances similaires, un investisseur privé d' une taille qui puisse être comparée à celle de la SNCB aurait pu être amené à procéder aux apports de capitaux de cette importance [39].
198. La Cour a précisé que si le comportement de l' investisseur privé, auquel doit être comparée l'intervention de l'investisseur public poursuivant des objectifs de politique économique, n'est pas nécessairement celui de l'investisseur ordinaire plaçant des capitaux en vue de leur rentabilisation à plus ou moins court terme, il doit, au moins, être celui d' un holding privé ou d' un groupe privé d' entreprises poursuivant une politique structurelle, globale ou sectorielle, et guidé par des perspectives de rentabilité à plus long terme [40]. Le Tribunal a défini de manière plus précise la méthode d'évaluation à suivre par la Commission. Il a précisé que la Commission est obligée "de faire une analyse complète de tous les éléments pertinents de l'opération litigieuse et de son contexte" afin de savoir si l'État a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché [41].
199. Il faut donc établir, dans le cas d'espèce, la rentabilité de l'intervention de la SNCB, ce qui suppose de démontrer que l'investissement dans IFB dégagera une marge bénéficiaire normale.
200. Par sa décision de convertir la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros, qui était une mesure temporelle de sauvetage, en une augmentation de capital, la SNCB pérennisera cet investissement.
201. En décidant d'ajouter à cette augmentation de capital la somme de 5 millions d'EUR, elle a décidé de faire un investissement supplémentaire de 5 millions d'EUR.
202. La conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et des intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social et le principe de l'augmentation de capital additionnel de 5 millions d'euros ont été décidés au printemps 2005; leur analyse doit donc être placée sous l'angle des faits connus de la SNCB à ce moment [42].
203. Ces deux mesures doivent être comparées à la décision d'un investisseur privé de participer à une augmentation de capital d'IFB.
204. La Commission note d'abord l'absence d'un investisseur privé, qui aurait participé, avec la SNCB, à l'augmentation de capital d'IFB.
205. Le gouvernement belge considère que la SNCB a agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché. Pour démontrer cela, il donne l'exemple suivant: Si la SNCB avait recapitalisé IFB au 1er janvier 2004 par conversion des dettes d'IFB vis-à-vis de la SNCB (de l'ordre de 79 millions EUR à ce moment) et d'un apport supplémentaire de l'ordre de 21 millions EUR, IFB aurait disposé de fonds propres en début d'exercice d'environ 16 millions EUR. En outre, elle aurait réalisé un bénéfice d'exploitation de 5,74 millions EUR (rendement de 36 % sur fonds propres) et un bénéfice courant avant impôts de plus de 7,18 millions EUR (45 % sur fonds propres). La marge opérationnelle bénéficiaire sur le chiffre d'affaires aurait alors été de l'ordre de 7 % en 2004. Le résultat de 2004 étant fortement influencé par l'utilisation et la reprise de certaines provisions faites en 2001 et 2002 pour les pertes attendues des filiales françaises, le gouvernement belge propose de neutraliser ces événements extraordinaires, ce qui laisse une marge opérationnelle bénéficiaire sur le chiffre d'affaire de 2,9 % pour 2004. Le gouvernement belge n'a pas transmis d'estimation pour les bénéfices d'IFB pour les années suivantes.
206. La Commission considère que le développement d'IFB depuis 2003 témoigne certes de la viabilité économique d'IFB. Cependant, le test de l'investisseur privé en économie de marché vise non seulement la viabilité économique d'une entreprise, mais la rentabilité de celle-ci. Selon la Cour, "il convient d'apprécier si, dans des circonstances similaires, un associé privé se basant sur les possibilités de rentabilités prévisibles, abstraction faite de toute considération de caractère social ou de politique régionale ou sectorielle, aurait procédé à un tel apport de capital" [43]. Cette possibilité de rentabilité doit, "au moins, être celui d' un holding privé ou d' un groupe privé d' entreprises poursuivant une politique structurelle, globale ou sectorielle, et guidé par des perspectives de rentabilité à plus long terme" [44].
207. La rémunération normale s'apprécie en tenant compte notamment de la rentabilité moyenne des concurrents. A cet égard, le gouvernement belge a informé la Commission que le chiffre d'affaires et la rentabilité des concurrents d'IFB était la suivante (en millions EUR):
| Chiffres d'affaires 2003 | Bénéfice en 2003 | Bénéfice en 2003 en % | Chiffres d'affaires 2004 | Bénéfice en 2004 | Bénéfice en 2004 en % |
CEMAT | 164,1 | 1,4 | 0,9 | 176,6 | 3,9 | 2,2 |
CNC | 193,5 | - 17,0 | - 8,8 | 164,4 | - 20,6 | - 12,5 |
HUPAC | 195,2 | 5,7 | 2,9 | 225,6 | 6,0 | 2,7 |
ICF | 276,5 | 0,5 | 0,2 | 261,1 | - 3,7 | - 1,4 |
Kombiverkehr | 289,2 | 0,8 | 0,3 | n/a | n/a | n/a |
Novatrans | 109,0 | - 7,1 | - 6,5 | 102,5 | - 5,5 | - 5,4 |
208. Il faut noter que ce tableau ne donne pas le rendement pour les grands concurrents Hesse-Noordnatie, Danzas, Ziegler, et Schenker, et que la plupart des entreprises citées par le gouvernement belge ont réalisé des pertes en 2004.
209. Les chiffres fournis par le gouvernement belge ne peuvent donc pas être utilisés pour apprécier si le rendement d'IFB est un rendement normal. En absence d'un chiffre de comparaison adéquate, la Commission constate qu'un rendement de 2,9 % est un rendement très faible, car il correspond à peu près au rendement des obligations gouvernementales. Cependant, un investissement dans IFB présente un risque nettement supérieur au risque des obligations gouvernementales.
210. Dès lors, la Commission considère que le rendement d'un investissement dans IFB ne serait pas suffisant pour convaincre un investisseur avisé en économie de marché de procéder à un tel investissement. Un investisseur avisé n'aurait donc pas procédé aux investissements que la SNCB a faits dans IFB.
c) Conclusion en ce qui concerne les mesures de restructuration
211. La Commission considère donc, à ce stade, que la SNCB n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier privé en économie de marché, en convertissant les dettes de 63 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 11 millions d'euros en capital social. Elle considère que la SNCB n'a pas non plus agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne la conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros et les intérêts liés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social et en ce qui concerne l'injection de 5 millions d'euros dans IFB.
3.1.3. Distorsion de concurrence et affectation des échanges entre les Etats membres
212. La Commission doit analyser la situation du marché concerné et les parts de marché des bénéficiaires sur ce marché, ainsi que l'impact que le soutien financier aura sur la situation de concurrence [45].
213. En l'espèce, le soutien financier a été accordé à une entreprise active sur des marchés ouverts à la concurrence, qui est en situation de concurrence avec d'autres acteurs de plusieurs Etats membres, comme démontré ci-dessus dans la partie "description". Le soutien financier fausse ou menace de fausser donc la concurrence, et menace d'affecter ou affecte les échanges entre les États membres.
3.1.4. Conclusion: présence d'une aide d'État
214. En conclusion, la Commission considère, à ce stade, que la SNCB n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un créancier avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne le délai de paiement et la conversion des créances de 63 millions d'euros dues et non payées le 31 janvier 2003, et qu'elle n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur avisé en économie de marché en ce qui concerne l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros, l'octroi d'une avance récupérable de 5 millions d'euros, la conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros en capital social ainsi qu'en ce qui concerne l'injection de capitaux frais de 5 millions EUR.
3.2. Compatibilité de l'aide
215. L'art. 87 §3 lit. c du traité CE prévoit que "peuvent être considérés comme compatibles avec le marché commun les aides destinées à faciliter le développement de certaines activités ou de certaines régions économiques, quand elles n'altèrent pas les conditions des échanges dans une mesure contraire à l'intérêt commun."
216. L'aide accordée par la Belgique à travers la SNCB pourrait être compatible avec le marché commun en vertu de l'article 87 § 3 c, tel qu'interprété par la Commission dans ses lignes directrices communautaires concernant les aides d'État au sauvetage et à la restructuration d'entreprises en difficulté (ci-après: les lignes directrices) [46].
217. Afin de pouvoir bénéficier d'aides au sauvetage et d'aides à la restructuration, une entreprise doit d'abord être éligible pour l'application des lignes directrices. Pour être éligible, une entreprise ne doit pas être une entreprise nouvellement créée, et doit être une entreprise en difficulté.
218. Pas d'entreprise nouvellement créée. Le point 12 des lignes directrices de 2004 précisent à ce propos, reprenant et précisant les lignes directrices de 1999, point 7:
Aux fins des présentes lignes directrices, une entreprise nouvellement créée ne peut bénéficier d'aides au sauvetage ou à la restructuration, même si sa position financière initiale est précaire. Tel est notamment le cas lorsqu'une nouvelle entreprise naît de la liquidation d'une entreprise préexistante ou de la reprise de ses seuls actifs. Une entreprise est en principe considérée comme nouvellement créée pendant les premières trois années qui suivent son entrée en activité dans le domaine concerné.
219. Il se pose donc d'abord la question de savoir si IFB est une entreprise nouvellement créée. Comme décrit ci-dessus dans la partie 2, IFB a été créée le 1er avril 1998, par la fusion de trois autres sociétés, qui avaient été créées en 1906, 1923 et 1967 respectivement.
220. Comme expliqué ci-dessus dans la partie 3.1.2.1, le premier avantage octroyé par la SNCB à IFB était l'octroi tacite d'un délai de paiement pour les services prestés par la SNCB, mais non payé par IFB, à partir de l'année 2001 au plus tôt.
221. L'entreprise IFB a été créée le 1er avril 1998 par la fusion de trois sociétés préexistantes. A ce stade, il n'est pas clair si l'entreprise continue la personnalité juridique d'une de ces trois sociétés. Si telle était le cas, IFB serait clairement une entreprise de plus de trois ans en 2001.
222. Si IFB ne continuait pas la personnalité juridique d'une de ces sociétés, mais était une entreprise nouvellement créée le 1er avril 1998, il dépasserait l'age de trois ans le 1er avril 2001. Dans cette hypothèse, elle ne serait éligible pour des aides à la restructuration qu'à partir du 1er avril 2001.
223. La Commission exprime donc des doutes si IFB est une entreprise éligible aux aides à la restructuration, et invite les autorités belges de lui fournir tout renseignement utile afin de vérifier si IFB, vu ces considérations, est une entreprise éligible pour les aides à la restructuration.
224. Entreprise en difficulté. Il n'existe pas de définition communautaire de l'entreprise en difficulté. Les lignes directrices considèrent dans leur paragraphe 5 (version de 1999) respectivement 10 (version de 2004) qu'une société à responsabilité limitée, comme l'est IFB, qui est une société par actions, est en tout cas considérée comme en difficulté lorsque plus de la moitié de son capital souscrit a disparu et que plus du quart de ce capital a été perdu au cours des douze derniers mois. Les comptes annuels de 2002 montrent un capital souscrit de EUR 48 millions et des pertes courantes avant impôts de 50 millions EUR. Par conséquent, le capital social avait disparu quant la SNCB avait décidé en avril 2003 d'accorder des aides au sauvetage. Plus de la moitié du capital souscrit ayant disparu à ce moment, dont plus d'un quart dans les douze derniers mois, IFB est une entreprise en difficulté au sens des lignes directrices.
225. Les lignes directrices sont donc applicables. Il y a lieu d'analyser si les aides accordées par la SNCB à IFB les ont respectées. A cet égard, il y a lieu d'abord d'analyser si au moins une partie des aides ont été des aides au sauvetage compatibles avec les lignes directrices.
3.2.1. Compatibilité en tant qu'aides au sauvetage
226. Seules les mesures consistant en une aide de trésorerie pourraient être compatibles en tant qu'aides au sauvetage. Dans le présent cas, les aides de trésorerie sont l'accord d'un délai de paiement tacite au plus tôt en 2001, au plus tard le 19 septembre 2002, devenu délai de paiement exprès dès le 7 avril 2003, la facilité de crédit et l'avance récupérable.
227. Il se pose d'abord la question de savoir qu'elle version des lignes directrices est applicable. La dernière version de ces lignes directrices est entrée en vigueur le 10 octobre 2004. Elle dispose dans son point 7 "date d'application et durée":
102. La Commission appliquera les présentes lignes directrices à partir du 10 octobre 2004 et jusqu'au 9 octobre 2009.
103. Les notifications enregistrées par la Commission avant le 10 octobre 2004 seront examinées au regard des critères en vigueur au moment de la notification.
104. La Commission examinera la compatibilité avec le marché commun de toute aide au sauvetage ou à la restructuration octroyée sans son autorisation et donc en violation de l'article 88, paragraphe 3, du traité sur la base des présentes lignes directrices si l'aide, ou une partie de celle-ci, a été octroyée après leur publication au Journal officiel de l'Union européenne. Dans tous les autres cas elle fera l'examen sur la base des lignes directrices applicables au moment de l'octroi de l'aide.
228. Les aides de trésorerie ont été octroyées au plus tôt en 2001, ou courant 2002 et dans leur ensemble le 7 avril 2003, sans notification préalable à la Commission et donc en violation de l'article 88 § 3 du traité CE. L'appréciation de leur compatibilité en tant qu'aides au sauvetage, en faisant abstraction des autres mesures à considérer comme des aides à la restructuration, se fera donc sur base des lignes directrices de 1999.
229. Le paragraphe 23 des lignes directrices de 1999, qui sont d'application pour les aides au sauvetage que la SNCB a accordées à IFB éventuellement en 2001, certainement en 2002 et 2003, définit les cinq conditions pour qu'une aide au sauvetage puisse être compatible avec le marché commun. Ces cinq conditions sont les suivantes:
a) consister en des aides de trésorerie prenant la forme de garanties de crédits ou de crédits. Dans les deux cas de figures, le crédit doit être soumis à un taux au moins comparable aux taux observés pour des prêts à des entreprises saines et notamment aux taux de référence adoptés par la Commission;
b) être liées à des crédits dont la durée de remboursement qui suit le dernier versement à l'entreprise des sommes prêtées ne dépasse pas douze mois; le remboursement du prêt lié à l'aide au sauvetage peut éventuellement être couvert par l'aide à la restructuration qui serait autorisée ultérieurement par la Commission;
c) être justifiées par des raisons sociales aiguës et ne pas avoir des effets graves de débordement ("spillover") négatif dans d'autres États membres;
d) être accompagnées, lors de leur notification, d'un engagement de l'État membre de transmettre à la Commission, dans un délai de six mois à compter de l'autorisation de l'aide au sauvetage, soit un plan de restructuration, soit un plan de liquidation, soit la preuve que le prêt a été intégralement remboursé et/ou qu'il a été mis fin à la garantie;
e) se borner dans leur montant à ce qui est nécessaire pour l'exploitation de l'entreprise (par exemple, la couverture des charges salariales ou des approvisionnements courants) pendant la période pour laquelle l'aide est autorisée.
3.2.1.1. Aide consistant en une aide de trésorerie
230. Pour rappel, les mesures de sauvetage consistent en un délai de paiement pour des créances d'une valeur totale de 63 millions EUR, en une avance récupérable de 5 millions EUR, qui a été accordée, mais non pas utilisée par IFB, et en une facilité de crédit de 15 millions EUR.
231. Par conséquent, l'aide consiste en une aide de trésorerie, qui se compose d'un délai de paiement, d'une avance récupérable et d'une facilité de crédit.
3.2.1.2. Aide liée à des crédits dont la durée de remboursement qui suit le dernier versement à l'entreprise ne dépasse pas douze mois
232. La durée de remboursement prévue par le contrat cadre est de douze mois. Néanmoins, le gouvernement belge a informé la Commission que la durée a été tacitement prolongée entre les parties jusqu'au moment de l'augmentation de capital.
233. De plus, l'avantage résultant du délai de paiement a déjà été octroyé au plus tôt courant l'année 2001, au plus tard le 19 décembre 2002. La Commission considère donc que ce critère n'est pas rempli, et que les aides de trésorerie ne peuvent pas être autorisées comme des aides au sauvetage.
3.2.1.3. Conclusion
234. En conclusion, la Commission considère, à ce stade, que les aides de trésorerie que la SNCB a accordées à IFB ne sont pas compatibles avec le marché commun en vertu de l'article 87 § 3 c du traité en tant qu'aides au sauvetage. Elles pourraient néanmoins être compatibles avec le marché commun en tant qu'aides à la restructuration.
3.2.2. Compatibilité des aides à la restructuration
235. Il se pose de nouveau la question de savoir quelle version des lignes directrices est applicable. Pour rappel, la dernière version de ces lignes directrices est entrée en vigueur le 10 octobre 2004. Elle dispose dans son point 7 "date d'application et durée":
102. La Commission appliquera les présentes lignes directrices à partir du 10 octobre 2004 et jusqu'au 9 octobre 2009.
103. Les notifications enregistrées par la Commission avant le 10 octobre 2004 seront examinées au regard des critères en vigueur au moment de la notification.
104. La Commission examinera la compatibilité avec le marché commun de toute aide au sauvetage ou à la restructuration octroyée sans son autorisation et donc en violation de l'article 88, paragraphe 3, du traité sur la base des présentes lignes directrices si l'aide, ou une partie de celle-ci, a été octroyée après leur publication au Journal officiel de l'Union européenne. Dans tous les autres cas elle fera l'examen sur la base des lignes directrices applicables au moment de l'octroi de l'aide.
236. Les aides de trésorerie ont été octroyées en partie au plus tôt courant l'année 2001, au plus tard le 19 septembre 2002, et dans leur ensemble le 7 avril 2003, sans notification préalable à la Commission et donc en violation de l'article 88 § 3 du traité CE. Leur conversion en capital était prévue depuis la conclusion du contrat cadre le 7 avril 2003, mais n'a pas eu lieu jusqu'à ce jour.
237. Puisque la SNCB a mis en œuvre l'aide de trésorerie sans accord préalable de la Commission, il faut appliquer le point 104 des lignes directrices de 2004 pour déterminer les lignes directrices applicables au présent cas. L'aide de trésorerie a été accordé en partie au plus tôt courant l'année 2001, au plus tard le 19 septembre 2002, et pour le reste le 7 avril 2003, et donc avant la publication des lignes directrices de 2004 au Journal officiel. Si l'aide était limitée aux aides de trésorerie, il faudrait donc appliquer les lignes directrices de 1999, car l'octroi de l'aide aurait eu lieu avant la publication des lignes directrices de 2004.
238. Cependant, la conversion des créances en capital constitue une mesure ultérieure, qui modifie la nature des avantages antérieurement consentis à IFB. A cet égard, le contrat-cadre fait état de l'intention des parties de procéder à cette conversion, mais sous réserve notamment de l'approbation du plan de restructuration par les deux Conseils d'administration et par l'État belge, ainsi que de l'approbation par les actionnaires d'IFB. A ce stade, il n'est donc pas démontré que la mesure a été définitivement octroyée avant la publication des lignes directrices de 2004, en ce sens que l'autorité compétente s'est engagée par un acte juridiquement contraignant à accorder l'aide avant cette date [47]. Si tel n'était pas le cas, et considérant que la conversion des créances en capital n'a pas été notifiée avant le 10 octobre 2004, les lignes directrices de 2004 seraient applicables.
239. Les autorités belges ont notifié à la Commission, par lettre du 28 janvier 2005, que la SNCB devrait accorder un nouveau avantage de 5 millions EUR sous forme d'une augmentation de capital par apport en nature en 2005 ou 2006. Dans un tel cas, une aide aurait été notifiée après le 10 octobre 2004. En vertu du point 103 des lignes directrices de 2004, il faudrait alors appliquer les lignes directrices de 2004 à cette nouvelle notification.
240. La Commission est tenue de statuer sur l'ensemble des mesures qui lui ont été notifiées; elle base donc son appréciation juridique sur les lignes directrices de 2004. Cependant, elle attire l'attention du gouvernement belge et des parties tiers intéressées sur le fait que si la SNCB décide de ne pas accorder de nouveau avantage à IFB, et si la preuve était apportée que la SNCB s'était engagée à convertir ses créances en capital avant la publication des lignes directrices de 2004, la Commission devrait examiner dans sa décision finale les aides accordées par la SNCB à IFB sur la base des lignes directrices de 1999. Les doutes exprimés ci-dessous sur la base du texte de 2004 valent aussi, mutatis mutandis, pour le texte de 1999.
241. Le point 3.2.2 des lignes directrices de 2004 énonce les conditions pour l'autorisation d'une aide à la restructuration. Les conditions sont les suivantes:
- Le plan de restructuration doit permettre de rétablir dans un délai raisonnable la viabilité à long terme de l'entreprise
- Des mesures doivent être prises pour atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents.
- L'aide doit être limitée au strict minimum nécessaire pour permettre la restructuration.
- La Commission doit être mise en mesure de s'assurer du bon déroulement du plan de restructuration, au travers de rapports réguliers et détaillés.
- Les aides à la restructuration ne doivent être accordées qu'une seule fois.
3.2.2.1. Plan de restructuration
242. L'octroi des aides à la restructuration est conditionné par la mise en œuvre d'un plan de restructuration, qui doit permettre de rétablir dans un délai raisonnable la viabilité à long terme de l'entreprise, sur la base d'hypothèses réalistes concernant les conditions d'exploitation future.
243. Les paragraphes 32 à 34 des lignes directrices précisent les conditions minimales pour l'acceptation d'un plan de restructuration par la Commission. Le plan de restructuration doit notamment contenir les éléments suivants:
- Une étude de marché.
- Une description des circonstances ayant entraîné les difficultés de l'entreprise, permettant d'évaluer si les mesures proposées dans le plan sont adaptées pour permettre le retour à la viabilité de l'entreprise.
- Une description des changements prévus pour que l'entreprise puisse, une fois la restructuration achevée, couvrir tous ses coûts, y compris les coûts d'amortissement et les charges financières, et affronter la concurrence en ne comptant plus que sur ses seules forces.
244. Le gouvernement belge a présenté un plan de restructuration pour IFB en décembre 2003, et détaillé ce plan dans la suite, qui contient ces éléments et dont les détails sont décrits dont la partie 2 de la présente décision.
245. Ce plan contient une analyse des marchés de la logistique et du transbordement du fret, ainsi que la position d'IFB sur ce marché. Il décrit les raisons pour les difficultés d'IFB, qui ont leur racine notamment dans une politique d'expansion en France, qui a été mal menée, et dans une mauvaise gestion des activités "IFB Terminals" et "IFB Logistics".
246. Finalement, ce plan décrit les changements prévus pour que l'entreprise puisse, une fois la restructuration achevée, couvrir tous ses coûts en ne comptant que sur ses seules forces. Les changements prévus sont notamment la cessation des filiales françaises, ainsi qu'une restructuration des activités "IFB Logistics" et "IFB Terminals". Ces restructurations impliquent notamment une concentration sur les offres rentables, une nouvelle convention collective, et une réorganisation des terminaux.
247. La mise en œuvre de ce plan de restructuration a été terminée, avec succès, en 2005.
3.2.2.2. Viabilité économique de l'entreprise
248. Le plan de restructuration contient les mesures prévues par IFB pour retrouver sa viabilité économique. Comme décrit ci-dessus, IFB n'a pas su atteindre ses objectifs financiers en 2003. Cependant, dès l'exercice 2004, il a pu atteindre les objectifs fixés par le plan de restructuration, et a même réalisé un bénéfice supérieur à ce qui était prévu. Ce bon développement s'est poursuivi en 2005.
249. IFB a réussi à augmenter sensiblement le volume de fret transporté depuis le début du programme de restructuration (voir description ci-dessus dans la partie 2). Cela explique aussi la croissance de son chiffre d'affaires, de 58 millions d'euros en 2003 à 83 millions d'euros en 2004.
250. L'entreprise IFB a donc su démontrer sa viabilité économique à la fois dans son plan de restructuration, présenté en 2003, et dans ses résultats réalisés depuis lors.
3.2.2.3. Mesures pour atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents
251. Des mesures compensatoires doivent être prises pour atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents. A défaut, l'aide d'État devrait être considérée comme contraire à l'intérêt commun, et donc incompatible avec le marché commun.
252. Les autorités belges expliquent que, afin d'atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents, IFB a pris deux mesures:
- Le retrait de ses activités de transbordement en France.
- La fermeture du terminal de Bressoux en Belgique et la vente des participations dans les terminaux à Bruxelles et à Zeebrugge en Belgique.
253. Ces deux mesures ont eu pour conséquence une baisse de son chiffre d'affaires de 62 millions d'euros en 2002 à 58 millions d'euros en 2003. Cependant, son chiffre d'affaires en 2004 a déjà été supérieur au chiffre d'affaires de 2002, avec 83 millions d'euros.
254. La Commission attire cependant l'attention de la Belgique sur le point 40 des lignes directrices de 2004, qui dispose:
Les radiations comptables et la fermeture d'activités déficitaires qui seraient en tout état de cause nécessaires pour rétablir la viabilité ne seront pas considérées comme une réduction de la capacité ou de la présence sur le marché aux fins de l'appréciation des contreparties.
255. D'après les informations que le gouvernement belge a transmis à la Commission, il semble que le retrait du marché français, ainsi que la fermeture des terminaux en Belgique, concernaient des activités déficitaires.
256. Afin de savoir si ces deux mesures sont suffisantes pour atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents, il convient de rappeler les principaux développements des deux marchés sur lesquels IFB est actif, à savoir le marché de la logistique et le marché du transbordement du fret. Ensuite, il convient d'analyser si les mesures proposées atténuent autant que possible les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents.
a) Le marché de la logistique et les aides pour IFB
257. Comme expliqué dans la partie 2 de cette décision, le marché de la logistique est un marché en plein mutation, due à l'ouverture des marchés du transport ferroviaire et à l'entrée sur le marché des entreprises ferroviaires et postales, avec à la fois un grand nombre de petits acteurs spécialisés et de grands acteurs intégrés.
258. La Commission note que les mesures proposées ne concernent pas le marché de la logistique. Comme le montre le tableau du paragraphe 16 de la présente décision, IFB a su augmenter son volume sur ce marché de manière importante en 2004 (par rapport à 2003). La Belgique n'a présenté aucun engagement qui aurait limité, pendant la période de la restructuration, la présence d'IFB sur ce marché.
259. La Commission considère dès lors que l'absence de mesures proposées pour le marché de la logistique, ainsi que les faits que le marché est en plein mutation et qu'IFB a su augmenter son volume de manière importante, créent des doutes si la Belgique a limité, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables pour la concurrence en ce qui concerne les activités de logistique d'IFB.
b) Le marché du transbordement de fret et les aides pour IFB
260. Les deux mesures proposées concernent le marché du transbordement de fret. IFB a quasiment arrêté ses activités en France, et a clôturé un terminal en Belgique et a vendu ses participations dans deux autres terminaux.
261. Le seul marché pour lequel l'aide peut avoir des conséquences négatives pour la concurrence est donc le marché belge. Sur ce marché, IFB a moins de 7 % des parts de marchés (cf. description des marchés dans la partie 2 de cette décision).
262. Afin de limiter les effets négatifs de l'aide sur le marché belge, IFB a clôturé un terminal, et a vendu ses participations dans deux autres. La Commission note cependant d'un côté que la fermeture concernait le plus petit des terminaux, et que la fermeture servait en premier lieu à réduire les pertes d'IFB Terminals, et de l'autre côté qu'IFB exploitera de nouveau les deux terminaux qu'il a vendu après l'augmentation de capital, car la société TRW, dont la SNCB apportera 47 % des parts sociales à IFB, détient des participations importantes dans les terminaux de Bruxelles et de Zeebrugge.
263. Ensuite, la Commission note qu'IFB possède des participations minoritaires dans un nombre importants de terminaux belges.
264. Par conséquent, la Commission a des doutes sur la question de savoir si les mesures proposées par IFB pour limiter, autant que possible, les effets négatifs de l'aide pour la concurrence sur le marché du transbordement du fret sont suffisantes.
3.2.2.4. Limitation de l'aide au strict minimum et contribution du bénéficiaire
265. Afin de démonter que l'aide est limitée au strict minimum, le gouvernement belge explique que l'augmentation du capital se limite à restaurer le capital social d'IFB, qui était devenu négatif suite aux pertes enregistrées en 2001 et 2002, à une hauteur qui lui permet de retrouver la viabilité économique. Comme expliqué ci-dessus dans la partie 2, le taux de solvabilité, c'est-à-dire le ratio fonds propres/passif, d'IFB sera de 33 % après l'augmentation de capital.
266. La Belgique a communiqué à la Commission les taux de solvabilité des principaux concurrents d'IFB. Ils sont les suivants:
Sociétés de terminaux | |
ABP Ports | 59,60 |
Hesse-Noord Natie | 58,19 |
Katoennatie Terminals | 54,97 |
Schelde Container Terminal Noord | 53,33 |
Sea-Ro-Terminal | 43,75 |
RSC | 74,24 |
Moyenne | 57,35 |
| |
Sociétés de Transport | |
DHL Freight (route) | 34,60 |
ECS European Containers (route) | 14,27 |
Gefco Benelux (rail) | 39,92 |
Henri Essers (route) | 15,71 |
Rhinecontainer (barge) | 18,63 |
TRW (rail) | 20,74 |
Ziegler (route) | 20,42 |
Moyenne | 23,47 |
| |
Sociétés aux activités mixtes | |
Gosselin | 38,92 |
Hupac | 34,90 |
Moyenne | 36,91 |
| |
Moyenne générale | 39,24 |
267. La Commission prend note de la circonstance que le taux de solvabilité envisagé pour IFB est inférieur à celui des sociétés de terminaux et aussi, bien que dans une moindre mesure, à celui des sociétés ayant des activités mixtes. Cependant, ce taux est supérieur à la moyenne des taux enregistrés dans les sociétés de transport. Il est vrai également que l'augmentation du capital est inférieure de 20 millions EUR à ce que le consultant McKinsey avait préconisé dans le plan de restructuration. Toutefois, à ce stade, la Commission ne dispose pas d'éléments suffisants pour conclure de manière définitive que l'aide a été limitée au strict minimum.
268. La Commission attire l'attention du gouvernement belge sur les dispositions des points 42 et suivants des lignes directrices de 2004, qui prévoient:
Les bénéficiaires de l'aide doivent contribuer de manière importante au plan de restructuration sur leurs propres ressources, y compris par la vente d'actifs qui ne sont pas indispensables à la survie de l'entreprise, ou par un financement extérieur obtenu aux conditions du marché. Cette contribution est un signe indiquant que les marchés croient à la faisabilité du retour à la viabilité. Elle doit être réelle, c'est-à-dire effective, à l'exclusion de tous bénéfices potentiels, tels que du cash flow, et doit être la plus élevée possible.
La Commission considèrera normalement que les contributions suivantes à la restructuration seront appropriées: au moins 25 % dans le cas des petites entreprises, au moins 40 % pour les entreprises de taille moyenne et au moins 50 % pour les grandes entreprises. Dans des circonstances exceptionnelles et dans des situations de difficulté particulière qui doivent être démontrées par l'État membre, la Commission pourra accepter une contribution propre réelle moins élevée.
Pour limiter l'effet de distorsion de la concurrence, le montant de l'aide ou la forme sous laquelle elle est accordée, doit être de nature à éviter que l'entreprise ne dispose de liquidités excédentaires qu'elle pourrait consacrer à des activités agressives susceptibles de provoquer des distorsions sur le marché qui ne seraient pas liées au processus de restructuration. À cet effet, la Commission examinera le niveau du passif de l'entreprise après sa restructuration, y compris après tout report ou réduction de ses dettes, en particulier dans le cadre de son maintien en activité à la suite d'une procédure collective de droit national relative à son insolvabilité. L'aide ne doit en aucune façon servir à financer de nouveaux investissements qui ne sont pas indispensables au retour à la viabilité de l'entreprise.
269. La Commission note que d'après le plan de restructuration, IFB ne semble pas faire de contribution propre à sa restructuration. Dès lors, la Commission a des doutes si IFB contribue, comme l'exige les lignes directrices de 2004, à son aide à la restructuration de manière suffisante.
3.2.2.5. Rapport annuel et "one time, last time"
270. Le gouvernement belge a accepté de fournir à la Commission un rapport annuel pour permettre à la Commission d'évaluer si le plan de restructuration est mis en oeuvre selon les engagements pris par les autorités belges.
271. Finalement, il y a lieu de vérifier si l'aide à la restructuration a respecté le principe "One time, last time". D'après les informations fournies par les autorités belges, IFB n'a pas bénéficié d'une aide à la restructuration auparavant. La Commission n'a pas encore pris de décision par rapport à IFB auparavant. Elle considère donc que le critère "one time, last time" a été respecté.
3.3. Conclusion
272. La Commission considère, à ce stade, que l'octroi d'un délai de paiement pour les dettes existantes de 63 millions d'euros et leur conversion, ainsi que la conversion des intérêts y liés de 11 millions d'euros, en capital social constituent une aide d'État, car la SNCB n'a pas agi comme l'aurait fait un investisseur privé en économie de marché.
273. De même, l'octroi d'une avance récupérable de 5 millions d'euros et l'octroi d'une facilité de crédit de 15 millions d'euros, la conversion de la facilité de crédit de 15 millions et des intérêts y liés de 2,5 millions d'euros en capital social, ainsi que l'apport en nature de 5 millions d'euros de nouveau capital social constituent des aides d'État.
274. Dans la mesure où ces aides constituent des aides de trésorerie, elles ne peuvent pas être déclarées compatibles avec le marché commun en tant qu'aides à la restructuration, car elles ont été octroyées pour une période qui dépasse 12 mois.
275. La Commission a des doutes sur la question de savoir si l'ensemble des aides peut être déclarées compatibles avec le marché commun en tant qu'aides à la restructuration.
276. Ses doutes portent sur l'imputabilité d'une partie de l'aide à l'État belge, le caractère suffisant des mesures prises pour atténuer, autant que possible, les conséquences défavorables de l'aide pour les concurrents, ainsi que sur la limitation de l'aide au strict minimum et sur la suffisance de la contribution propre de l'entreprise IFB aux aides à la restructuration.
4. DÉCISION
La Commission a décidé de considérer, à ce stade, que les mesures de sauvetage et les mesures de restructuration en faveur d'IFB constituent des aide d'État au sens de l'article 87 (1) du traité CE.
Elle émet des doutes sur la question de savoir si ces aides peuvent être déclarées compatibles avec le marché commun en vertu des lignes directrices pour les aides à la restructuration et ouvre donc pour cette partie du dossier la procédure prévue à l'article 88 § 2 du traité CE.
Compte tenu des considérations qui précédent, la Commission invite la Belgique, dans le cadre de la procédure de l'article 88, paragraphe 2, du traité CE, à présenter ses observations et à fournir toute information utile pour l'évaluation de l'aide dans un délai d'un mois à compter de la date de réception de la présente. Elle invite vos autorités à transmettre immédiatement une copie de cette lettre au bénéficiaire potentiel de l'aide.
La Commission rappelle à la Belgique l'effet suspensif de l'article 88, paragraphe 3, du traité CE et se réfère à l'article 14 du règlement (CE) no 659/1999 du Conseil qui prévoit que toute aide illégale pourra faire l'objet d'une récupération auprès de son bénéficiaire.
Par la présente, la Commission avise la Belgique qu'elle informera les intéressés par la publication de la présente lettre et d'un résumé de celle-ci au Journal officiel de l'Union européenne. Elle informera également les intéressés dans les pays de l'AELE signataires de l'accord EEE par la publication d'une communication dans le supplément EEE du Journal officiel, ainsi que l'autorité de surveillance de l'AELE en leur envoyant une copie de la présente. Tous les intéressés susmentionnés seront invités à présenter leurs observations dans un délai d'un mois à compter de la date de cette publication."
"1. PROCEDURE
1.1. Zaak NN 9/2004
1. Bij schrijven van 12 augustus 2003, geregistreerd bij de Europese Commissie op 20 augustus 2003 (TREN/A(03)27718), hebben de Belgische autoriteiten enkele door de Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen (NMBS) en haar dochtermaatschappij Inter Ferry Boats (IFB) gesloten overeenkomsten aangemeld krachtens artikel 88, lid 3, van het EG-Verdrag. Deze aanmelding behelst reddingsmaatregelen die de NMBS heeft genomen ten gunste van IFB.
2. Op 13 oktober 2003 (D(03)17546) heeft het directoraat-generaal Energie en vervoer de Belgische autoriteiten verzocht de Commissie aanvullende inlichtingen te verstrekken. In verband hiermee heeft op 12 december 2003 een bilaterale ontmoeting met de Belgische autoriteiten plaatsgevonden. Tijdens deze ontmoeting werd een door McKinsey opgesteld herstructureringsplan voor IFB gepresenteerd.
3. De Belgische autoriteiten hebben de brief van de Commissie beantwoord met het schrijven van 7 januari 2004, dat op 13 januari 2004 (TREN/A(04)10708) bij de Commissie is geregistreerd. Uit genoemd schrijven blijkt dat de aangemelde reddingsmaatregelen reeds gedeeltelijk zijn uitgevoerd. Derhalve is de zaak geregistreerd onder nummer NN 9/2004. Op 30 april 2004 heeft nogmaals een vergadering plaatsgevonden. De Belgische autoriteiten hebben bij schrijven van 15 juni 2004, dat bij de Commissie op 21 juni 2004 is geregistreerd (TREN/A(04)23691), de aanvullende documenten toegestuurd waarom de Commissie tijdens deze vergadering had verzocht.
4. Bij schrijven van 26 januari 2005 (D(05)100339) heeft het directoraat-generaal Energie en vervoer de Belgische autoriteiten verzocht aanvullende inlichtingen te verstrekken betreffende de ontwikkeling van IFB, en met name haar herstructurering.
5. Bij schrijven van 25 maart 2005, dat bij de Commissie is geregistreerd op 30 maart 2005 (TREN/A(05)7712), hebben de Belgische autoriteiten de Commissie de aanvullende inlichtingen toegestuurd waarom zij in haar schrijven van 26 januari 2005 had verzocht.
1.2. Zaak N 55/2005
6. Bij schrijven van 28 januari 2005 (SG(2005)A1133) hebben de Belgische autoriteiten bij de Commissie het voornemen van de NMBS om het kapitaal van IFB te verhogen, aangemeld. De Belgische autoriteiten zijn van mening dat het niet om staatssteun gaat, maar hebben dit voornemen aangemeld om redenen van rechtszekerheid. De Commissie heeft deze zaak als een nieuw dossier "aangemelde staatssteunmaatregel" geregistreerd onder nummer N 55/2005.
7. Bij schrijven van 29 maart 2005 (D(05)106199) heeft het directoraat-generaal Energie en vervoer de Belgische autoriteiten verzocht aanvullende inlichtingen te verstrekken over de herstructureringsmaatregelen van IFB.
8. Bij schrijven van 28 april 2005, geregistreerd bij de Commissie op 3 mei 2005 (SG(2005)A(05)4155), hebben de Belgische autoriteiten de Commissie de aanvullende inlichtingen toegezonden waarom in de brief van 29 maart 2005 was verzocht.
9. Bij brief van 31 mei 2005 (D(05)111096) heeft het directoraat-generaal Energie en vervoer de Belgische autoriteiten verzocht aanvullende inlichtingen te verstrekken betreffende de op 28 april 2005 toegezonden informatie.
10. Bij schrijven van 30 juni 2005, dat bij de Commissie is geregistreerd op 1 juli 2005 (TREN/A(05)16598), hebben de Belgische autoriteiten de Commissie de aanvullende inlichtingen toegezonden waarom in de brief van 31 maart 2005 was verzocht.
11. Op 16 september 2005 heeft een werkvergadering plaatsgevonden tussen de Commissie en de Belgische autoriteiten. Tijdens deze vergadering heeft de Commissie de Belgische autoriteiten verzocht aanvullende inlichtingen te verstrekken. De Belgische autoriteiten hebben deze inlichtingen toegezonden per e-mail van 21 oktober 2005, die bij de Commissie is geregistreerd op 24 oktober 2005 (TREN/A(05)27067).
2. GEDETAILLEERDE BESCHRIJVING VAN DE REDDINGS- EN HERSTRUCTURERINGSMAATREGELEN
2.1. De partijen in de kaderovereenkomst betreffende de redding en herstructurering van IFB
2.1.1. IFB
2.1.1.1. Beschrijving van IFB
12. Inter Ferry Boats (IFB) is een naamloze vennootschap volgens Belgisch recht. De NMBS bezit 89,03 % van het maatschappelijk kapitaal. De overige aandeelhouders zijn CNC Transports, voor 93,8 % een dochtermaatschappij van de NMBS (7,41 %), ICF (2,08 %) en EWS (English Welsh and Scottish Railway — 1,22 %). IFB telt momenteel 245 werknemers.
13. IFB werd op 1 april 1998 opgericht door de fusie van de volgende drie bedrijven: Ferry Boats Ltd., Interferry Ltd. en de spoordivisie van Edmond Depaire Ltd. Vóór de oprichting van IFB was Ferry Boats Ltd. een onderneming die onder de gezamenlijke zeggenschap stond van de Britse spoorwegen en de Belgische spoorwegen. Interferry Ltd. en Edmond Depaire Ltd. vielen onder de zeggenschap van de Belgische spoorwegen. Uit de door België verstrekte documenten blijkt niet duidelijk of IFB de rechtspersoonlijkheid van een van de drie ondernemingen heeft voortgezet.
14. Ferry Boats Ltd. werd in 1923 opgericht onder de naam "Société Belgo-Anglaise des Ferry-Boats". Interferry is in 1967 opgericht onder de naam "Intercontainer" en de onderneming Edmond Depaire in 1906 opgericht als een particuliere onderneming voor het vervoer van containers.
15. De activiteiten van IFB zijn geconcentreerd in twee sectoren:
- de activiteitensector "IFB Logistics", voor het commerciële beheer van de expeditieactiviteiten van IFB, en
- de activiteitensector "IFB Terminals", die de inlandterminals exploiteert.
Aan deze activiteiten moeten de participaties en de dochtermaatschappijen worden toegevoegd die IFB heeft of had in België en in het buitenland.
a) De activiteit IFB Logistics
16. De activiteit "IFB Logistics" betreft het commerciële beheer door IFB, alsmede door de ondernemingen waarin zij een participatie heeft, van:
- expeditieactiviteiten (inclusief aanvullende "transport engineering"-diensten) en
- logistieke diensten.
17. De expeditieactiviteiten zijn de belangrijkste activiteiten van "IFB Logistics". Deze activiteiten bestaan erin aan de cliënten zo volledig mogelijke vervoersoplossingen aan te bieden. Wat de expeditieactiviteiten betreft, vertegenwoordigt het spoorvervoer, ongeacht of het gaat om conventioneel dan wel om gecombineerd vervoer, voor IFB de belangrijkste wijze van vervoer, maar IFB biedt ook vervoer over de binnenwateren en over de weg aan. Voor IFB is het spoorvervoer vooral vervoer over "korte" of "middellange" afstand (100 à 500 km, waarbij IFB vooral optreedt als partner van de reders voor de ontwikkeling van "carrier haulage", een activiteit welke die van de spoorwegexploitanten (die zich veeleer concentreren op langeafstandsvervoer) aanvult.
18. De door IFB verzonden goederen zijn bulkproducten, containers en diverse producten (general cargo). In onderstaande tabel wordt de hoeveelheid vracht aangegeven die door IFB in 2003 en 2004 over het conventionele spoor, het intermodale spoor en over de binnenwateren is vervoerd. Uitsluitend in gevallen waarin de cliënt heeft verzocht om dienstverlening van deur tot deur of van/naar een zeeterminal, maakt IFB gebruik van het vervoer over de weg om transporteenheden naar of vanuit spoorwegterminals te vervoeren.
19. De belangrijkste cliënten van IFB Logistics zijn de zeevrachtbedrijven […] [48] [49] en […], alsmede […] [50], […], […] [51] en […]. De producten die worden vervoerd zijn met name chemische producten, steenkool en granulaat. In onderstaande tabel zijn de door IFB in 2003 en 2004 vervoerde volumes aangegeven.
Jaar | Conventioneel spoor [52] | Intermodaal spoor | Binnenvaart |
2003 | 0,672 miljoen ton | 423583 TEU [53] | 0,385 miljoen ton |
2004 | 1,995 miljoen ton | 481556 TEU | 1,023 miljoen ton |
20. De expeditieactiviteiten omvatten ook aanvullende "transport engineering"-diensten, zoals opslag, distributie, overslag, …, die er nauw mee samenhangen.
21. In het kader van haar organisatie valt ook de activiteit van agent voor rekening van derde spoorwegexpediteurs/vervoerders onder IFB Logistics. IFB is als logistiek agent in België actief voor een aantal buitenlandse ondernemingen.
22. De markt voor expeditieactiviteiten en logistieke activiteiten heeft de voorbije jaren een aanzienlijke groei gekend, die samenhangt met de toenemende mondialisering van het bedrijfsleven, de trend naar uitbesteding en een steeds verdergaande specialisatie van de productieondernemingen (just in time production).
23. De belemmeringen voor de toegang tot de markt zijn afgenomen en op de markt zijn zowel tal van kleine gespecialiseerde actoren als grote geïntegreerde actoren (DHL, UPS, …) aanwezig. Als gevolg van de liberalisering van de spoorwegmarkt en van de markt voor postdiensten hebben spoorwegondernemingen (Deutsche Bahn, NMBS) en postondernemingen (Deutsche Post) hun intrede gedaan op die markt.
24. De combinatie van marktgroei, toetreding van belangrijke nieuwkomers en liberalisering van het spoorvervoer heeft gemaakt dat deze markt volop aan het veranderen en bewegen is.
b) IFB Terminals
25. IFB Terminals exploiteert inlandterminals (overladen van intermodale transporteenheden (ITU) van/naar het spoor).
26. De voornaamste activiteit van de inlandterminals ("dry ports") bestaat in het overladen van zeecontainers van vrachtwagens op spoorwagons. IFB exploiteert in totaal zes inlandterminals die zijn aangesloten op het Belgische spoorwegnet en waarvan er zich vier in de haven van Antwerpen en drie in het Belgische achterland bevinden.
27. De inlandterminals in de haven van Antwerpen zijn "Mainhub", "Cirkeldijck", "Zomerweg" en "Schijnpoort". De Belgische regering onderstreept dat deze vier terminals zich in een bijzondere situatie bevinden, aangezien zij gelegen zijn in de haven van Antwerpen, in het centrum van de zeevaartactiviteiten waarmee zij onlosmakelijk zijn verbonden. De ITU die in deze terminals worden behandeld, zijn hoofdzakelijk zeecontainers, die eerst van schepen naar vrachtwagens worden overgeslagen in een niet door IFB geëxploiteerde zeeterminal. Pas nadien worden deze containers van de vrachtwagens naar treinwagons overgeslagen in een door IFB geëxploiteerde inlandterminal. In geval van export over zee is de volgorde omgekeerd. In 2004 hebben de vier inlandterminals van IFB in de haven van Antwerpen 0,4 miljoen TEU behandeld.
28. IFB exploiteert twee inlandterminals die zich niet in de haven van Antwerpen bevinden, namelijk de terminal van Muizen (in de buurt van Mechelen, terminal weg-spoor) en de terminal van Rénory (in de buurt van Luik, verkeer weg-spoor-binnenschip). Een derde terminal, die van Bressoux, is in 2003 gesloten.
29. De markt voor terminals is een stabielere markt dan die voor logistiek. Het aantal in België geëxploiteerde terminals blijft constant. Het aantal vervoerde containers neemt echter toe ten gevolge van de groei van het verkeer in de haven van Antwerpen en de inspanningen om meer goederen via het gecombineerde vervoer te transporteren.
c) De participaties van IFB
30. IFB heeft of had participaties in ondernemingen die zee- en inlandterminals exploiteren, alsmede in vervoersondernemingen. IFB heeft of had in totaal een dertigtal participaties.
31. Participaties in de zee- en inlandterminals in Duinkerke. IFB heeft belangrijke investeringen gedaan in de haven van Duinkerke, waar zij meerderheidsparticipaties bezat in Acimar (terminal voor staalproducten, volle dochtermaatschappij van NFTI-ou) en NFTI-ou (terminal voor zeecontainers, participatie van 60 % in 2003, sindsdien verminderd tot 30 %), Dry Port Dunkerque (DPD, een spoorwegterminal, sinds 2003 ongewijzigd gebleven participatie van 90 %), Short Sea Terminal Dunkirk (SSTD, laden en lossen van opleggers, participatie van 50 % in 2003, sindsdien tot 0 % teruggebracht), en IFB France (holdingmaatschappij en onderneming voor dienstverlening aan in Duinkerke gevestigde verbonden ondernemingen, participatie van 100 %, sindsdien volledig verkocht aan NFTI-ou).
32. IFB France is omgedoopt tot Administration Gestion Entreprise Portuaires (AGEP). IFB heeft de totaliteit van haar aandelen in deze ondernemingen overgedragen aan NFTI-ou.
33. In december 2002 is een insolventieprocedure ingeleid tegen Acimar. Acimar is niet meer actief sinds 1 september 2003. Alle aandelen die IFB in Acimar bezat, zijn overgedragen aan AGEP (zie hierna).
34. IFB heeft haar participatie in NFTI-ou, die AGEP en, via AGEP, Acimar in haar bezit heeft, van 60 % teruggebracht tot 30 %. IFB heeft haar patronaat (door een moedermaatschappij tegenover derden aangegane verbintenis dat zij zal instaan voor de nakoming van de verplichtingen van haar dochtermaatschappij) ingetrokken door de opzegging van haar "comfort letter" (patronaatsverklaring). IFB is aldus bevrijd van elke verplichting om als garant voor NFTI-ou op te treden, aangezien deze verplichting volledig werd overgedragen aan de meerderheidsaandeelhouder, de Port Autonome de Dunkerque, die 70 % van de aandelen van NFTI-ou bezit. IFB tracht nu haar minderheidsparticipatie in NFTI-ou van de hand te doen.
35. IFB had een participatie van 90 % in DPD. In juni 2003 heeft IFB haar patronaatsverklaring opgezegd; vervolgens heeft IFB de infrastructuur en de apparatuur van DPD aan de Port Autonome de Dunkerque verkocht en DPD in juni 2004 ontbonden. De liquidatie werd afgesloten in de zomer van 2005.
36. IFB heeft haar participatie in SSTD verkocht in april 2005.
37. IFB heeft bijgevolg al haar participaties in de haven van Duinkerke verkocht, met uitzondering van haar minderheidsparticipatie in NFTI-ou, waarvoor zij een koper zoekt.
38. Participatie in terminals in België. In België had IFB participaties in de terminals van Zeebrugge, Brussel, Moeskroen, Athus, Luik en Charleroi.
39. In Zeebrugge hadden IFB en Hesse-Noord Natie het economische samenwerkingsverband OCHZ opgericht, waarvan IFB en Hesse-Noord Natie elk voor de helft mede-eigenaar waren. In september 2004 is IFB uit OCHZ gestapt en heeft zij haar rechten aan OCHZ verkocht.
40. In Brussel had IFB via Brussels Port Invest (BPI) en Brussels Terminal Intermodal (BTI) belangen in een trimodale containerterminal in de haven van Brussel. BTI is intussen ontbonden en aan een liquidatieprocedure onderworpen. Haar participatie in BPI heeft IFB overgedragen aan een andere onderneming buiten de NMBS-groep.
41. In Moeskroen heeft IFB een participatie van 16,76 % in de onderneming SA Dryport Mouscron Lille (DPM Li). Deze onderneming beschikt over een eigen kapitaal van 530000 euro en heeft in 2004 een nettoresultaat van 76000 euro gerealiseerd.
42. In Athus heeft IFB een participatie van 24,89 % in de onderneming SA Terminal Athus (Terminal Athus). Deze onderneming heeft een eigen kapitaal van 1,7 miljoen euro en heeft in 2002 een nettoresultaat van 61000 euro behaald (er zijn geen recentere gegevens beschikbaar).
43. In Luik heeft IFB een participatie van 45,12 % in Liège Logistics Intermodal. De Commissie beschikt niet over meer informatie over deze participatie.
44. In Charleroi heeft IFB een participatie van 14,28 % in de onderneming SA Charleroi Dry Port (Charleroi DP). Deze onderneming heeft een eigen kapitaal van 36000 euro en heeft in 2002 een nettoresultaat van 899 euro gerealiseerd (er zijn geen recentere gegevens beschikbaar).
45. IFB heeft op dit ogenblik bijgevolg minderheidsparticipaties in vier terminals in België, namelijk de terminals van Moeskroen, Luik, Athus en Charleroi. IFB heeft bovendien een participatie van 0,9 % in de onderneming die deze terminals exploiteert, namelijk TRW. De NMBS heeft een directe participatie van 47 % in TRW.
46. IFB heeft daarentegen haar participaties in de terminals van Zeebrugge en Brussel verkocht.
47. Participaties in vervoersondernemingen. IFB heeft of had de volgende participaties in vervoersondernemingen:
- CNC Ferry Boats intermodal, België, 50 % (eigen kapitaal: 61000 euro, nettoresultaat 2004: niet bekend) en haar volle dochtermaatschappij Rail Web. Rail Web is op 31 maart 2005 ontbonden.
- Affrètements Van Reeth, België, 100 % (eigen kapitaal: 412000 euro; nettoresultaat in 2002: 150000 euro).
- SA Unilog, België, 55 % (eigen kapitaal: 1,9 miljoen euro, nettoresultaat in 2004: 21000 euro).
- SA Unilog, Verenigd Koninkrijk, 100 % (geen andere informatie beschikbaar).
- SA Rail Infra Logistics, België, 99,93 % (eigen kapitaal: 500000 euro; nettoresultaat in 2004: 55000 euro).
- ACTS België, 12,5 % (geen andere informatie beschikbaar). Deze onderneming is op 29 maart 2005 ontbonden.
- RKE, België, 61,46 % (eigen kapitaal: 2,6 miljoen euro, nettoresultaat in 2004: 250000 euro).
- Coil Terminal, onrechtstreeks via RKE, aangezien RKE een participatie van 50 % heeft in Coil Terminal.
- CARRE (geen andere informatie beschikbaar). Er zijn onderhandelingen over de verkoop van CARRE aan de gang.
- GIE Cigogne Shuttle, België (geen andere informatie beschikbaar). IFB denkt eraan om uit deze onderneming te stappen.
- Haeger Schmidt International, Duitsland, 100 % (eigen kapitaal: 2,1 miljoen euro, nettoresultaat in 2004: niet bekend)
- Compagnie nouvelle des conteneurs Transports Nationaux et Internationaux, Frankrijk, 2 % (geen andere informatie beschikbaar).
- GIE NEN (geen andere informatie beschikbaar). GIE wordt ontbonden.
- ACTS Belgique, 13 % (geen andere informatie beschikbaar). Deze onderneming is op 5 november 2003 ontbonden.
- TRW, België, 0,89 %.
48. Participatie in Haeger and Schmidt International. Via haar volle dochtermaatschappij, Haeger and Schmidt International, heeft IFB participaties in Best Logistics (Polen), A. van Reeth (Frankrijk), KREAS en SITRA. Haeger and Schmidt heeft een jaaromzet van 50 miljoen euro, hoofdzakelijk door de binnenvaart.
49. Overzicht. In onderstaand schema wordt een algemeen overzicht gegeven van alle participaties van IFB. Het overzicht is als volgt opgebouwd:
eerste kolom: de participaties in ondernemingen die terminals exploiteren;
tweede kolom: de participaties in vervoersondernemingen;
derde kolom: de participaties in ondernemingen die diensten verrichten;
vierde kolom: de participaties in (Duitse) ondernemingen die actief zijn op het gebied van de binnenvaart (binnenschepen).

2.1.1.2. Definitie van de relevante markten en marktaandelen van IFB
50. De Commissie heeft in het verleden in haar beschikkingen COMP/M.3603 "UPS/Menlo" en COMP/M.3496 "TNT FORWARDING HOLDING/WILSON LOGISTICS" uitspraak gedaan over de definitie van de relevante markten voor expeditieactiviteiten en logistieke activiteiten; als relevante productmarkt heeft zij aangemerkt:
- voor de expeditieactiviteiten of freight forwarding: "the organisation of transportation items (possibly including ancillary activities such as customs clearance, warehousing, ground services, etc.) on behalf of customers according to their needs."
- voor de logistieke activiteiten of general logistic services: "the part of the supply chain process that plans, implements and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customers' requirements."
51. Deze markten zijn, ondanks een trend naar een sterkere internationalisering, als nationaal aangemerkt.
52. Volgens de door de Belgische regering verstrekte informatie ligt het marktaandeel van IFB Logistics op deze beide markten tussen 2 % en 5 %, wat zou kunnen worden verklaard door het betrekkelijk kleine deel van de goederen dat via gecombineerd vervoer en via het spoor wordt getransporteerd.
53. Deze raming lijkt betrouwbaar, wanneer de omzet van IFB, die in 2003 […] euro bedroeg, wordt vergeleken met de omzet van de andere Belgische actoren op die markt, die in 2003 in België de volgende omzet hebben gerealiseerd:
Onderneming | Omzet |
Hesse-Noordnatie | 485 miljoen euro |
Danzas | 176 miljoen euro |
Ziegler | 129 miljoen euro |
Schenker | 156 miljoen euro |
54. Wat de markt voor terminals betreft, moet een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen inlandterminals en zeeterminals.
55. De Commissie heeft in verband met de inlandterminals een standpunt over de definitie van de relevante markten ingenomen in haar beschikkingen COMP M 2632 "DEUTSCHE BAHN/ECT INTERNATIONAL/UNITED DEPOTS", IV/M 1651 "MAERSK/SEA LAND" en IV/M.831 "PT/Nedlloyd".
56. In haar beschikking COMP M 2632 heeft de Commissie de relevante productmarkt gedefinieerd als de markt "für das Erbringen von Umschlagdienstleistungen im Containergüter-Hinterlandverkehr per Binnenschiff zwischen ARA-Häfen und deutschem Niederrhein/Ruhrgebiet", en de geografische markt als "die Containerterminals entlang des Niederrheins von Nijmeggen bis Köln". Alle terminals van de Benedenrijn zouden met andere woorden de relevante markt zijn. In de beschikkingen IV M 1651 en IV M 831 wordt de geografische markt van een haven als volgt gedefinieerd: "Ports or groups of ports serve a particular hinterland or are used for transshipment to smaller ports. The geographic area they generally serve determines the geographic scope related to their services". Hieruit volgt dat de productmarkt de markt voor de overslag van vracht is en het geografische gebied dat erdoor wordt bestreken het achterland van een bepaalde haven.
57. In het onderhavige geval moet derhalve worden geconcludeerd dat de relevante productmarkt kan worden gedefinieerd als de markt voor diensten op het gebied van de overslag van ITU van/naar het vervoer over land (weg — spoorweg — binnenschip). De relevante geografische markt is op zijn minst de regio Antwerpen en omgeving, eventueel zelfs de regio van de ARA-havens.
58. Behalve de inlandterminals van IFB bieden ook de op zijn minst trimodale terminals van Hesse-Noordnatie (Noordzeeterminal, Europaterminal) en P O Ports (Seaport terminal) diensten op het gebied van de overslag van ITU van/naar het vervoer over land (weg — spoorweg — binnenschip) aan. Deze terminals zijn, wat het volume behandelde ITU betreft, heel wat belangrijker dan de terminals van IFB. In 2004 heeft Hesse-Noordnatie 4,9 miljoen TEU behandeld en P O Ports 0,7 miljoen TEU, terwijl IFB 0,4 miljoen TEU heeft behandeld. Het marktaandeel van IFB bedraagt derhalve ongeveer 6,7 %.
59. De twee zeeterminals waarin IFB participaties heeft, hebben in België en Frankrijk slechts marginale marktaandelen. IFB heeft geen participaties in terminals in andere landen.
2.1.2. De NMBS
60. De NMBS is opgericht bij de Belgische wet van 23 juli 1926 tot oprichting van de Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Buurtspoorwegen [54]. Sinds 14 oktober 1992 [55] is de NMBS een autonoom overheidsbedrijf en een naamloze vennootschap van publiek recht [56]. De NMBS valt bijgevolg onder de voor naamloze vennootschappen geldende wettelijke en bestuursrechtelijke bepalingen van het handelsrecht voor alle aspecten die niet uitdrukkelijk zijn geregeld bij of krachtens titel I van de wet van 21 maart 1991 houdende hervorming van sommige economische overheidsbedrijven dan wel door of krachtens een specifieke wet.
61. De Belgische staat heeft de structuur van de NMBS op 1 januari 2005 hervormd. Zij is omgevormd tot drie afzonderlijke vennootschappen, namelijk:
- NMBS Holding: een vennootschap "van het type holding" die participaties in de twee andere vennootschappen zal hebben,
- Infrabel, de infrastructuurbeheerder,
- Nieuwe NMBS, de spoorwegmaatschappij.
62. Het maatschappelijk doel van de NMBS staat omschreven in artikel 1bis van voornoemde wet van 23 juli 1926, dat in de wet van 1 augustus 1966 [57] is ingevoegd en bij artikel 155 van voornoemde wet van 21 maart 1991 als volgt is gewijzigd:
"(1) De maatschappij heeft tot doel het vervoer van reizigers en goederen per spoor."
"(2) De maatschappij kan, op eigen gezag, of door middel van deelneming in bestaande of op te richten Belgische, vreemde of internationale organismen, alle commerciële, industriële of financiële handelingen verrichten, die rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks, geheel of ten dele in verband staan met haar maatschappelijk doel, dan wel de verwezenlijking of de uitbreiding van dat doel kunnen vergemakkelijken of bevorderen."
"(3) Het feit dat er goederen of diensten worden gefabriceerd en verkocht, die rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks op de spoorwegactiviteiten betrekking hebben, is inzonderheid van aard de verwezenlijking of de uitbreiding van het maatschappelijk doel te bevorderen."
63. Dit artikel is door de Belgische jurisprudentie en rechtsleer steeds ruimer geïnterpreteerd. Volgens de Belgische autoriteiten vallen de activiteiten van IFB duidelijk onder dit artikel.
64. De beheersorganen van de NMBS zijn de raad van bestuur, het directiecomité en de gedelegeerd bestuurder. De raad van bestuur is samengesteld uit tien leden, met inbegrip van de gedelegeerd bestuurder. De bestuurders worden door de koning benoemd bij een besluit vastgesteld na overleg in de Ministerraad. Zij worden gekozen overeenkomstig de complementariteit van hun competentie inzake financiële en boekhoudkundige analyse, juridische aspecten, hun kennis van de vervoerssector, hun deskundigheid inzake mobiliteit, personeelsstrategie en sociale relaties. Nadat zij zijn benoemd oefenen de leden van de raad van bestuur hun mandaat op onafhankelijke wijze uit en aanvaarden zij van niemand instructies.
65. De leden van het directiecomité worden met uitzondering van de gedelegeerd bestuurder benoemd door de raad van bestuur, die ook het aantal leden bepaalt. Het directiecomité vormt een college.
2.2 De financiële moeilijkheden van IFB
66. Over de jaren 2001 en 2002 heeft IFB aanzienlijke verliezen geboekt: volgens de jaarrekeningen van IFB betreffende 2002 bedroeg het gecumuleerde verlies op 31 december 2002 137 miljoen euro (waarvan 25 miljoen euro overgedragen van 2001), met als resultaat negatieve eigen middelen ten belope van 84 miljoen euro. Aan het einde van het boekjaar 2001 bedroegen deze eigen middelen nog 28 miljoen euro.
67. Steeds volgens de jaarrekeningen van 2002 bedroegen de operationele verliezen in het boekjaar 2002, d.w.z. het verschil tussen de lopende uitgaven en de lopende ontvangsten, 13,4 miljoen euro. Eerst dienen de oorzaken van de financiële moeilijkheden te worden onderzocht en vervolgens moet de reactie van het management van IFB en van de NMBS, alsmede die van de particuliere schuldeisers van IFB worden beschreven.
2.2.1. De oorzaken van de financiële moeilijkheden
68. De financiële moeilijkheden waarmee IFB werd geconfronteerd bij haar participaties in Frankrijk in de haven van Duinkerke en die haar ertoe hebben verplicht belangrijke voorzieningen in haar jaarrekeningen van 2001 en 2002 op te nemen, zijn de belangrijkste oorzaak van de financiële moeilijkheden van IFB.
69. Bovendien leden de activiteiten "IFB Logistics" en "IFB Terminals" in 2001 en 2002 lichte verliezen.
2.2.2. De reactie van het management van IFB en van de NMBS
70. Sinds 2000 had IFB niet meer alle facturen betaald die de NMBS haar voor treindiensten had toegezonden. In 2001, en vooral in 2002, heeft IFB evenmin alle facturen betaald. De NMBS lijkt dat te hebben geduld. De totale waarde van de facturen van de NMBS die niet door IFB werden betaald, bedroeg eind januari 2003 63 miljoen euro.
71. Als gevolg van de financiële moeilijkheden van IFB raakten zowel de raad van bestuur van IFB als de voornaamste aandeelhouder, de NMBS, er steeds meer van overtuigd dat voor het overleven van de groep IFB op lange termijn het beheer van de onderneming structureel moest worden veranderd.
72. Op 19 september 2002 heeft de gedelegeerd bestuurder van IFB aan twee accountants de opdracht gegeven een bijzonder rapport op te stellen over de financiële toestand van de onderneming. Op 24 december 2002 heeft de bijzondere algemene vergadering der aandeelhouders (BAV) van IFB er kennis van genomen dat de NMBS, naar aanleiding van de vergadering van de raad van bestuur van 20 december 2002, bereid was in te tekenen op een kapitaalverhoging ter verbetering van de financiële toestand van IFB ten belope van maximaal 80 miljoen euro, waarvan 20 miljoen euro bestemd was om tegemoet te komen aan de behoeften van IFB aan liquide middelen. De raden van bestuur van de NMBS en IFB hebben in principe hun goedkeuring gehecht aan twee kapitaalverhogingen — van 60 miljoen euro door omzetting van vorderingen van de NMBS op IFB en van 20 miljoen euro door terbeschikkingstelling aan IFB van liquide middelen -, te onderschrijven door de NMBS om de voortzetting van de activiteiten van IFB te waarborgen.
73. IFB en de NMBS hebben op 7 april 2003 een "kaderovereenkomst m.b.t. de herstructurering van IFB" gesloten, teneinde tot genoemde kapitaalverhogingen over te gaan. Deze overeenkomst, een privaatrechtelijke overeenkomst, bestaat uit twee delen: een deel "reddingsmaatregelen" en een deel "herstructureringsmaatregelen".
74. Gezien de omstandigheden heeft de raad van bestuur van IFB na overleg met de voornaamste aandeelhouder, de NMBS, besloten een bijzondere algemene vergadering der aandeelhouders samen te roepen, zoals artikel 633 van het Belgische wetboek van vennootschappen voorschrijft wanneer het verlies minstens de helft van het maatschappelijk kapitaal bedraagt. Op deze vergadering, die op 20 mei 2003 werd gehouden, konden de aandeelhouders van IFB kennis nemen van het bijzondere rapport van de raad van bestuur van IFB, waarin de kaderovereenkomst tussen de NMBS en IFB werd besproken, en werd voorgesteld om de activiteiten van IFB na een herstructurering voort te zetten. Op basis hiervan zijn de aandeelhouders van IFB akkoord gegaan met de voortzetting van de activiteiten van IFB.
2.2.3. De reactie van de particuliere schuldeisers van IFB
75. Particuliere zakenbanken hebben IFB leningen en bankgaranties toegestaan. Volgens de door de Belgische regering verstrekte gegevens hebben de financiële moeilijkheden van IFB geen enkele invloed gehad op de relaties tussen IFB en de banken: alle banken hebben de bij overeenkomst vastgelegde voorwaarden gehandhaafd zonder andere aanvullende garanties, waarborgen of zekerheden te eisen dan de gebruikelijke. Nog volgens de Belgische regering waren alle banken bereid nieuwe leningen toe te staan tegen concurrerende voorwaarden.
76. Op 31 december 2004 had IFB de volgende leningsovereenkomsten gesloten met particuliere banken:
Doel van de lening | Bank | Jaar | % | Bedrag (in EUR) | Situatie op 31.12.2004 (in EUR) |
[…] | […] | 1997 | [tussen 2 % en 6 %] | 328334,97 | […] |
[…] | […] | 1999 | [tussen 2 % en 6 %] | 1264930,18 | […] |
[…] | […] | 1999 | [tussen 2 % en 6 %] | 1611307,91 | […] |
[…] | […] | 2001 | [tussen 2 % en 6 %] | 4945476,00 | […] |
[…] | […] | 2003 | [tussen 2 % en 6 %] | 2000000,00 | […] |
TOTAAL | | | | 10150049,06 | 5550066,03 |
77. De laatste leningsovereenkomst werd gesloten in juli 2003, dus na het sluiten van de kaderovereenkomst tussen IFB en de NMBS en nadat de banken hadden gehoord van de financiële moeilijkheden van IFB.
78. Op 31 december 2004 beschikte IFB over de volgende bankgaranties:
Begunstigde van de bankgarantie | Bedrag (in euro) |
Federale overheidsdienst FINANCIËN Garantie douane en accijnzen | 2401220,64 |
Federale overheidsdienst FINANCIËN Garantie fiscaal geschil | 1772817,63 |
Federale overheidsdienst MOBILITEIT EN VERVOER Garantie expediteur | 111552,12 |
Andere garanties | 44767,12 |
79. Alle kredietlijnen in verband met deze garanties zijn gehandhaafd zonder wijziging van de bij overeenkomst vastgestelde voorwaarden.
2.3. De belangrijkste bepalingen van de "kaderovereenkomst tussen de NMBS en IFB m.b.t. de herstructurering van IFB"
80. Om het voortbestaan van IFB te waarborgen hebben de NMBS en IFB de reeds aangehaalde kaderovereenkomst gesloten. Daarin wordt bepaald dat de voorgestelde maatregelen in twee fasen worden uitgevoerd: in een eerste fase wordt een reeks reddingsmaatregelen ten behoeve van IFB genomen totdat een herstructureringsplan voor IFB kan worden uitgevoerd; in een tweede fase zouden in het kader van een herstructureringsplan voor IFB maatregelen worden uitgewerkt en bij die gelegenheid zouden de reddingsmaatregelen in kapitaal kunnen worden omgezet.
81. In de preambule van de overeenkomst bevestigt de NMBS haar voornemen om "haar goedkeuring te hechten aan een door de NMBS te onderschrijven kapitaalverhoging van IFB ten belope van ongeveer 60 miljoen euro door omzetting van vorderingen van de NMBS op IFB en om IFB eveneens een bijkomend bedrag van 20 miljoen euro ter beschikking te stellen, waarvan 5 miljoen euro onmiddellijk zou worden vrijgegeven."
82. Artikel 2 van de kaderovereenkomst tussen de NMBS en IFB voorziet in twee pakketten maatregelen, namelijk een pakket "reddingsmaatregelen" en een pakket "herstructureringsmaatregelen".
2.3.1. Modaliteiten en voorwaarden voor de reddingsmaatregelen
83. Het eerste deel van artikel 2 voorziet in een pakket van drie reddingsmaatregelen:
(1) een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro;
(2) het toekennen van een kredietfaciliteit van maximaal 15 miljoen euro, en
(3) het verlenen van een voorlopig uitstel van betaling voor alle schulden van IFB.
84. Artikel 3 van de kaderovereenkomst bepaalt dat de rentevoet op het terugvorderbare voorschot en op de opgenomen sommen van de kredietfaciliteit ten minste gelijk moet zijn aan de door de Commissie gehanteerde referentierentevoet voor overheidssteun [58]. Het bepaalt tevens dat de rente bij het kapitaal zal worden gevoegd. De betaling ervan zal plaatsvinden op het ogenblik waarop de nog uitstaande vorderingen worden betaald.
85. Het voorschot en de kredietfaciliteit worden voorlopig ter beschikking gesteld teneinde te voldoen aan de dringende financiële behoeften van IFB. Zij zullen in het kader van het nog op te stellen herstructureringsplan in kapitaal worden omgezet.
86. Wat met name de toekenning van een kredietfaciliteit van maximaal 15 miljoen euro betreft, mag IFB de schuldvorderingen van de NMBS op IFB vanaf 1 januari 2003 in mindering brengen, met uitzondering van een factuur van 31 januari 2003 ten belope van 8 miljoen euro.
87. Het voorlopige uitstel van betaling heeft betrekking op alle schulden van IFB die op 31 december 2002 waren gefactureerd, met inbegrip van een factuur van 31 januari 2003 ten belope van 8 miljoen euro, en van de schulden waarvan het bedrag op 31 december 2002 zeker en vaststaand was maar die in regel niet werden gefactureerd. Het aan de NMBS verschuldigde bedrag beliep in totaal 63 miljoen euro. Bovendien moet het betrokken bedrag worden verhoogd met de gebruikelijke rente op achterstallige betalingen van [tussen 1 en 2] per duizend per volledige periode van tien dagen [59], of met de wettelijk vastgestelde rente. De rente wordt bij het kapitaal gevoegd en wordt betaald op het ogenblik dat de hoofdvordering wordt betaald.
88. De door IFB aan de NMBS verschuldigde rente op de schuld en de kredietfaciliteit beliep 2,2 miljoen euro in 2002, 3,9 miljoen euro in 2003 en 4,7 miljoen euro in 2004. In de kaderovereenkomst is bepaald dat de rente wordt betaald op het ogenblik dat de vorderingen worden betaald.
89. IFB heeft tegenover de NMBS ook afstand gedaan van de verjaring van haar schulden. Al deze maatregelen zijn, met uitzondering van het terugvorderbaar voorschot, ten uitvoer gelegd van bij de ondertekening van het contract op 7 april 2003. Het uitstel van betaling van zijn kant was de facto al verleend voordat de kaderovereenkomst werd gesloten en is door de kaderovereenkomst geformaliseerd.
2.3.2. Modaliteiten en voorwaarden voor de herstructureringsmaatregelen
90. Het tweede deel van artikel 2 van de kaderovereenkomst bepaalt dat door de raden van bestuur van de NMBS en IFB herstructureringsmaatregelen zullen worden uitgewerkt en dat deze vervolgens ter goedkeuring aan de Belgische overheid zullen worden voorgelegd.
91. Artikel 4 van de kaderovereenkomst betreffende de modaliteiten voor de herstructureringsmaatregelen luidt als volgt:
"Partijen bevestigen hun voornemen om — indien en voor zover deze conform zijn met een herstructureringsplan dat is goedgekeurd door hun beider raden van bestuur, door de Belgische overheid, en voor zover vereist, door de EC, en onder voorbehoud van goedkeuring door de aandeelhouders van IFB — de volgende maatregelen ten uitvoer te leggen:
- de omzetting in kapitaal van het terugvorderbaar voorschot t.b.v. 5 miljoen euro;
- de omzetting in kapitaal van het opgenomen gedeelte van de kredietfaciliteit t.b.v. maximum 15 miljoen euro […];
- de omzetting in kapitaal van de schulden […] van 63 miljoen euro;
- eventueel, en op voorwaarde dat beide partijen daarover akkoord zijn, een bijkomende kapitaalverhoging […]".
92. De Belgische regering heeft de Commissie tijdens de bijeenkomsten van 12 december 2003 en 16 september 2005, alsmede bij brief van 13 januari 2004, 28 januari 2005, 25 maart 2005 en 30 juni 2005 in kennis gesteld van de bijzonderheden betreffende de herstructureringsmaatregelen, die ad-hocmaatregelen omvatten welke door IFB zijn getroffen ten aanzien van haar dochtermaatschappijen die in Frankrijk terminals exploiteren, alsmede van een herstructureringsplan voor IFB en van een kapitaalverhoging.
93. Op dit ogenblik is nog geen van deze maatregelen ten uitvoer gelegd.
2.3.2.1. Ad-hocmaatregelen die door IFB zijn getroffen ten aanzien van haar dochtermaatschappijen die in Frankrijk terminals exploiteren
94. Zoals hiervoor is uiteengezet, heeft IFB voor haar Franse dochtermaatschappijen een strategie van desinvestering gevolgd. Dit beleid is vrijwel voltooid (zie de beschrijving van de participaties hiervoor); voorts werden de patronaatsverklaringen ingetrokken.
2.3.2.2. Het herstructureringsplan
95. IFB en de NMBS hebben met adviesbureau McKinsey een herstructureringsplan voor IFB uitgewerkt dat de economische levensvatbaarheid van IFB op de lange termijn garandeert. Dit plan bestaat uit twee delen:
- Herstructurering van de activiteit "IFB Logistics"
- Herstructurering van de activiteit "IFB Terminals"
96. Met de uitvoering van het herstructureringsplan werd een begin gemaakt in 2003 en het zal worden voltooid in 2005. In het plan was voorzien dat IFB een exploitatiewinst van 0,5 miljoen euro in 2003 en van 0,8 miljoen euro in 2004 zou behalen, na in 2002 bedrijfsverliezen van 13,4 miljoen euro te hebben geleden. Onderstaande tabel laat de voor 2002-2004 verwachte verdeling zien van de winst en het verlies tussen de verschillende activiteiten:
| 2002 | 2003 | 2004 |
Dochtermaatschappijen | […] | […] | […] |
IFB Terminals | […] | […] | […] |
IFB Logistics | […] | […] | […] |
Totaal | - 13,4 | 0,5 | 0,8 |
97. De in 2003 behaalde resultaten bleven achter bij de verwachtingen, aangezien het bedrijfsresultaat –2,9 miljoen euro beliep. Dit was voornamelijk te wijten aan de verliezen van de dochterondernemingen (verliezen van […] miljoen euro in plaats van een winst van […] miljoen euro) en aan de geringe winst van IFB Logistics (winst van […] miljoen euro in plaats van een verwachte winst van […] miljoen euro).
98. De in 2004 behaalde resultaten overtroffen de verwachtingen, aangezien het bedrijfsresultaat een winst van 5,7 miljoen euro vertoonde. Hieraan werd door IFB Logistics voor […] miljoen euro, door IFB Terminals voor […] miljoen euro en door de dochterondernemingen voor […] miljoen euro bijgedragen.
99. In het herstructureringsplan wordt tevens de noodzaak aangedragen van nieuwe investeringen ten belope van […] miljoen euro. De voor de verschillende sectoren geplande herstructureringsmaatregelen alsook de behoefte aan nieuwe investeringen dienen meer in detail te worden gepresenteerd.
a) Herstructurering van de logistieke activiteit
100. Ten aanzien van de activiteit "IFB Logistics" was in het herstructureringsplan voor 2003 een exploitatiewinst van […] miljoen euro geraamd, na een verlies van […] miljoen euro in 2002. Ter verwezenlijking hiervan bevatte het plan in totaal negen maatregelen die een besparing van […] miljoen euro mogelijk zouden maken. Door de daling van het volume aan conventioneel vervoer, die naar verwachting een verlies van […] miljoen euro met zich zal meebrengen, zou de totale verbetering dus […] miljoen euro belopen. Onderstaande tabel bevat de negen maatregelen:
Maatregelen | Besparing |
1.Vermindering van de loonkosten | […] miljoen |
2.Advies en outsourcing | […] miljoen |
3.Waardevermindering en bijzondere afschrijvingen | […] miljoen |
4.Stopzetting van niet-rendabele afdelingen van het North European Network | […] miljoen |
5.Volumedaling van het conventioneel vervoer | […] miljoen |
6.Terugneming uit voorzieningen onderhoud wagons | […] miljoen |
7.Groei van het intermodaal vervoer | […] miljoen |
8.Herziening van de Railbarge-overeenkomst (verhoging van de prijzen en verwezenlijkte re-engineering) | […] miljoen |
9.Verhoging van de provisies van de vertegenwoordigers (agent) | […] miljoen |
10.Verlaging van de algemene kosten | […] miljoen |
101. De herstructureringsmaatregelen bestonden dus in hoofdzaak uit een prijsverhoging, gekoppeld aan een nieuw design van de producten, terugneming van voorzieningen en bijzondere afschrijvingen, vermindering van de loonkosten en de algemene kosten, en stopzetting van onrendabele activiteiten.
102. Voor de activiteit "IFB Logistics" zal de herstructurering volgens de planning dus tussen medio-2003 en medio-2004 zijn voltooid.
b) Herstructurering van de terminalactiviteit
103. De herstructurering van de activiteit "IFB Terminals" daarentegen zal waarschijnlijk drie jaar in beslag nemen. Volgens de verwachtingen zullen de operationele verliezen van deze activiteit van […] miljoen euro in 2002 dalen tot […] miljoen euro in 2003 en […] miljoen euro in 2004, alvorens 2005 af te sluiten met een exploitatiewinst van […] miljoen euro. Ter verwezenlijking hiervan bevatte het plan de volgende acht maatregelen:
Maatregelen | Besparing |
1.Mainhub:PersoneelsinkrimpingComputeraanpassingenVermindering van de afschrijvingen en terugneming van de voorzieningenUitbreiding van het aantal bewerkingen | […] miljoen |
2.CirkeldijckVermindering van de operaties op het terreinVerkoop van activaVerhuring van de terminalVermindering van het volumePersoneelsinkrimping | […] miljoen |
3.ZomerwegTransfer RailbargeVergroting van het volumeUitbreidingenInvesteringen | […] miljoen |
4.Dry port MuizenVermindering van personeelskosten dankzij het nieuwe bewakingssysteemVergroting van het volume | […] miljoen |
5.SchijnpoortVergroting van het volumeVermindering van de exploitatiekosten | […] miljoen |
6.RenoryVerkoop van een stackerStopzetting financiële solidariteit van IFB | […] miljoen |
7.Bressoux: Sluiting van de terminal | […] miljoen |
104. De belangrijkste maatregelen hebben dus betrekking op de terminals Mainhub, Cirkeldijck en Zomerweg. In onderstaande paragrafen worden zij meer gedetailleerd uiteengezet.
105. Mainhub. Mainhub zal tussen medio 2003 en eind 2005 volledig worden gereorganiseerd, hetgeen — met name dankzij omvangrijke computeraanpassingen — personeelsinkrimping in combinatie met een verhoging van het aantal bewerkingen mogelijk zal maken. Daardoor kan worden gezorgd voor een betere capaciteitsbezetting van de terminal, die in 2002 slechts voor […] % is gebruikt.
106. Cirkeldijck. In de Cirkeldijck-terminal zal IFB haar samenwerking met Hesse NoordNatie (HNN) verstevigen. HNN zal de operaties op het terrein overnemen, terwijl IFB de planning en het laden van het spoorvervoer behoudt. […].
107. Zomerweg. De Zomerweg-terminal zal van bimodale terminal tot een trimodale terminal worden omgevormd, waarbij alle Railbarge-vervoer naar deze terminal wordt overgebracht. In deze context worden het terrein en het perron uitgebreid, worden het terrein, de ingang en de wegen aangepast en zullen investeringen in materieel vereist zijn.
c) Noodzaak van investeringen
108. Voor de herstructurering van Mainhub en de herstructurering van Zomerweg zijn nieuwe investeringen, elk ten belope van […] miljoen euro, vereist. Terzelfder tijd kan het benodigde bedrag door de verkoop van de portaalkraan van de Cirkeldijck-terminal worden verlaagd tot in totaal […] miljoen euro.
2.3.2.3. Kapitaalverhoging
109. Bij schrijven van 28 januari 2005 heeft de Belgische regering de Commissie ervan in kennis gesteld dat het leidinggevend personeel van zowel IFB als de NMBS van oordeel is dat het herstructureringsplan vergezeld moet gaan van een verhoging van het kapitaal van IFB, zoals in de kaderovereenkomst was vastgelegd. Het benodigde bedrag, ten opzichte van de ramingen van de kaderovereenkomst iets naar boven bijgesteld, zou 96,5 miljoen euro bedragen.
110. De kapitaalverhoging zal als volgt verlopen: eerst worden de schulden van IFB jegens de NMBS, die 78 miljoen euro belopen, en de rente over die schulden, die eind 2005 13,5 miljoen euro zal belopen, in kapitaal omgezet. De oorsprong van deze schulden ligt in reddingsmaatregelen 1 en 2, dat wil zeggen het uitstel van betaling en de kredietfaciliteit. Vervolgens zal de NMBS de rest, dat wil zeggen 5 miljoen euro, in natura inbrengen. De procedure komt dus overeen met de in artikel 4 van de kaderovereenkomst vastgelegde procedure.
111. De inbreng in natura bestaat uit de participatie van de NMBS in TRW. Deze deelneming beloopt, zoals hierboven is uiteengezet, 47 %; IFB bezit al een participatie van 0,9 % in de onderneming. TRW exploiteert terminals in Antwerpen, Zeebrugge, Oostende, Charleroi, Luik, Brussel, Etge, Genk en Muizen, en biedt vrachttreinen aan voor 11 EU-landen.
112. De kapitaalverhoging bedraagt meer dan bij het afsluiten van de kaderovereenkomst tussen IFB en de NMBS was bepaald — hierin was namelijk een kapitaalverhoging van 80 miljoen euro vastgesteld — maar minder dan het voorstel van adviesbureau McKinsey, dat in het herstructureringsplan uitging van een kapitaalverhoging van 120 miljoen euro.
113. De Belgische regering is van mening dat IFB met deze kapitaalverhoging, na de aftrek van kapitaal om de overgedragen verliezen te dekken, een eigen vermogen van 23,9 miljoen euro zou hebben, wat een gezonde kapitaalstructuur zou zijn met een aan de activiteiten van IFB aangepaste verhouding tussen de financiering met eigen vermogen en de schulden.
114. De solvabiliteitscoëfficiënt, dat wil zeggen de verhouding tussen eigen vermogen en passiva, van IFB voor en na de kapitaalverhoging wordt door onderstaande tabel verduidelijkt:
| Situatie op 30.06.2005 | Voorgestelde verhoging | Situatie na verhoging |
Eigen vermogen | - 72,6 | 96,5 | 23,9 |
Voorzieningen en belastinglatenties | 14,3 | | 14,3 |
Schulden | 125,6 | - 91,5 | 34,1 |
Totaal passiva | 67,3 | | 72,3 |
Solvabiliteits-coëfficiënt | | | 33 % [60] |
115. De kapitaalverhoging is voorzien voor het tweede halfjaar 2005, na goedkeuring door de Europese Commissie en de Raad van Bestuur van de NMBS.
116. In tegenstelling tot hetgeen in artikel 4 van de kaderovereenkomst is bepaald, is het plan voor de kapitaalverhoging niet ter goedkeuring aan de Belgische regering voorgelegd. De Belgische regering is van mening dat een dergelijke goedkeuring niet vereist is omdat het een louter commerciële beslissing van de NMBS betreft, die deze onderneming zonder goedkeuring van de staat kan nemen.
2.4. Financiële ontwikkeling van IFB sinds de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst
117. De economisch-financiële situatie van IFB is sedert de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst in april 2003 aanmerkelijk verbeterd. Zo vertoonde het bedrijfsresultaat een positieve ontwikkeling van -47,36 miljoen euro in 2002 tot 5,74 miljoen euro in 2004. Het resultaat van het boekjaar voor aftrek van belastingen steeg van -109,76 miljoen euro in 2002 naar 13,21 miljoen euro in 2004.
118. Onderstaande tabel bevat een kort overzicht van de ontwikkeling van de belangrijkste economische en financiële indicatoren van IFB:
Tabel: Economisch-financiële situatie van IFB (in 000 euro)
| 31.12.2002 (aan audit onder-worpen) | 30.09.2003 | 31.12.2003 (aan audit onder-worpen) | 30.09.2004 | 31.12.2004 (aan audit onder-worpen) |
Verkopen en verrichtingen | 65377 | 43184 | 59091 | 61369 | 85751 |
Waarvan omzet | 63669 | 42445 | 58079 | 59903 | 83343 |
Kosten van verkopen en verrichtingen | 112734 | 43781 | 62051 | 58759 | 80011 |
Bedrijfsresultaat | (47357) | (1336) | (2960) | 2610 | 5740 |
Financieel resultaat | (3034) | — | (4458) | (3247) | (3303) |
Uitzonderlijk resultaat | (59369) | — | 7342 | 6754 | 10773 |
Resultaat van het boekjaar voor aftrek van belastingen | (109760) | (1200) | (76) | 6117 | 13210 |
Cash Flow | | (101) | | | |
Eigen vermogen | (84068) | (85277) | (83941) | (77775) | (74850) |
119. De verbetering van de economisch-financiële situatie is enerzijds te danken aan de uitvoering van het herstructureringsplan en anderzijds aan de strategie van afsplitsing ten aanzien van de participaties.
120. Ook in het eerste halfjaar 2005 boekte IFB winst: het bedrijfsresultaat beliep 1,6 miljoen euro en het resultaat voor aftrek van belastingen was 2,2 miljoen euro.
2.4.1. Uitvoering van het herstructureringsplan
121. Voor de tenuitvoerlegging van het herstructureringsplan moet een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de maatregelen die gevolgen hebben voor alle activiteiten van IFB en de specifieke maatregelen voor IFB Logistics en IFB Terminals.
2.4.1.1. Maatregelen die gevolgen hebben voor alle activiteiten van IFB
122. Door de sluiting van een nieuwe arbeidsovereenkomst op het niveau van de onderneming en de wijziging van het arbeidsreglement kon een hogere participatiegraad (het aantal dagen dat per jaar moet worden gewerkt is toegenomen) tegen geringere kosten (de vergoeding voor weekendwerk en ploegenarbeid is verlaagd). De administratieve en commerciële diensten zijn centraal in Berchem ondergebracht, waardoor de vestiging in Gent kon worden gesloten en de capaciteit van die in Zeebrugge kon worden teruggebracht.
123. Deze maatregelen hebben bijgedragen tot vermindering van het benodigde personeel en verlaging van de algemene kosten.
2.4.1.2. Specifieke maatregelen voor IFB Terminals
124. Naast de in het herstructureringsplan vervatte maatregelen zijn nog twee maatregelen genomen: Voor de terminal te Cirkeldijck is de prijs voor de afhandeling naar boven bijgesteld. Meer algemeen zijn de vervoersstromen geanalyseerd en vervolgens in onderling overleg met de klanten geheroriënteerd.
125. Dankzij al deze maatregelen, en door de groei van de behandelde hoeveelheden, kon IFB Terminals al in 2004 weer winstgevend worden, met een winst voor belastingaftrek van […] euro, na een verlies na belastingaftrek van […] miljoen euro in 2003. De doelstelling die in het herstructureringsplan was vastgelegd is dus ruimschoots gehaald (ter herinnering: in het herstructureringsplan was op een verlies van […] euro gerekend.)
2.4.1.3. Specifieke maatregelen voor IFB Logistics
126. Naast de in het herstructureringsplan vervatte maatregelen heeft IFB Logistics een diepgaande analyse verricht van zijn spoorvervoerproducten; hierbij zijn onrendabele producten aangetroffen, die IFB sindsdien niet meer produceert.
127. Voor andere producten heeft deze analyse de noodzaak van verbeteringen op technisch niveau aangetoond. Deze verbeteringen zijn aangebracht, met name voor de sector intermodaal containervervoer.
128. Dankzij al deze maatregelen kon IFB Logistics al in 2003 weer winstgevend worden met een winst voor belastingaftrek van […] euro. In 2004 waren de resultaten verder verbeterd tot […] miljoen euro. IFB Logistics heeft de doelstelling die voor 2003 in het herstructureringsplan was vastgelegd ([…] miljoen euro) dat jaar niet kunnen halen, maar wel in 2004 (het streefcijfer was […] miljoen euro).
2.5. Budget
129. Het geraamde totaalbedrag van de reddingsmaatregelen beloopt maximaal 78 miljoen euro [61].
130. Het totaalbedrag van de beoogde kapitaalverhoging beloopt 96,5 miljoen euro, waarvan 78 miljoen euro zal resulteren uit de omzetting van de bestaande schulden (63 miljoen) en van de reddingsmaatregelen (15 miljoen) in kapitaal, en 13,5 miljoen euro uit de omzetting van de gekapitaliseerde rente in kapitaal. Nog eens 5 miljoen euro zal door de NMBS in natura worden ingebracht, door overdracht van de deelneming van de NMBS in TRW aan IFB.
2.6. Terbeschikkingstelling van financiële middelen en looptijd
131. In haar brieven van 28 januari en 25 maart 2005 verklaart de Belgische regering dat de maatregelen 2 (kredietlijn van 15 miljoen euro) en 3 (uitstel van betaling voor de bestaande schulden van 63 miljoen euro) van het deel "reddingsmaatregelen" met ingang van 7 april 2003 door de NMBS en IFB ten uitvoer zijn gelegd. Daarentegen had IFB het in maatregel 1 vastgelegde terug te betalen voorschot niet nodig.
132. In de kaderovereenkomst is bepaald dat, behoudens omzetting in kapitaal in het kader van een goedgekeurd eventueel herstructureringsplan of enige andere overeengekomen maatregel van vergelijkbare strekking, alle bedragen vermeerderd met rente twaalf maanden nadat zij door de NMBS ter beschikking van IFB zijn gesteld dienen te worden terugbetaald. Aangezien het leidinggevend personeel van IFB en van de NMBS had ingestemd met het principe van een kapitaalverhoging, is volgens hen de leningovereenkomst stilzwijgend verlengd totdat de kapitaalverhoging plaatsvindt. IFB accumuleert intussen de in de kaderovereenkomst vastgelegde rente, te weten de gebruikelijke rente op achterstallige betalingen van [tussen 1 en 2]‰ per volledige periode van 10 dagen [62], of een wettelijk vastgestelde rentepercentage. De gemiddelde rente bedraagt [tussen 3,6 en 7,2] %. De volledige rente moet worden betaald op het ogenblik dat de schuld wordt voldaan of wordt omgezet in maatschappelijk kapitaal.
133. De kapitaalverhoging zal in het tweede halfjaar 2005 plaatsvinden, na goedkeuring ervan door de Commissie.
3. BEOORDELING
3.1. Beoordeling van het steunkarakter van de reddings- en herstructureringsmaatregelen
134. Overeenkomstig artikel 87, lid 1, van het Verdrag "zijn steunmaatregelen van de staten of in welke vorm ook met staatsmiddelen bekostigd, die de mededinging door begunstiging van bepaalde ondernemingen of bepaalde producties vervalsen of dreigen te vervalsen, onverenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt, voorzover deze steun het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten ongunstig beïnvloedt".
3.1.1. Steunmaatregel van de staat of met staatsmiddelen bekostigd
135. Daarom rijst allereerst de vraag of het bij de financiële steun van de NMBS aan IFB om "steunmaatregelen van de staten of met staatsmiddelen bekostigd" gaat. Volgens de jurisprudentie van het Hof van Justitie in de zaak Stardust Marine [63] wordt aan dit criterium voldaan indien het om staatsmiddelen gaat en indien de beslissing om deze te verlenen aan de betrokken lidstaat, in casu België, kan worden toegerekend.
3.1.1.1. Staatsmiddelen
136. Wat het aspect "staatsmiddelen" betreft, constateert de Commissie dat de NMBS als een openbaar bedrijf in de zin van artikel 2 van Richtlijn 2000/52/EG [64] van de Commissie moet worden aangemerkt: de Belgische staat bezit 100 % van het geplaatst kapitaal van de NMBS en de Raad van Bestuur en de gedelegeerd bestuurder worden bij koninklijk besluit benoemd na overleg in de Raad van ministers. Derhalve is zowel aan criterium a) als aan criterium c) van de tweede alinea van artikel 2 van de richtlijn voldaan.
137. In dit verband "... volgt reeds uit de rechtspraak van het Hof dat artikel 87, lid 1, EG alle geldelijke middelen omvat die de overheid daadwerkelijk kan gebruiken om ondernemingen te steunen, ongeacht of deze middelen permanent deel uitmaken van het vermogen van de staat. Dus ook al zijn de bedragen die overeenkomen met de betrokken maatregel niet permanent in het bezit van de schatkist, dan nog volstaat het feit dat zij constant onder staatscontrole, en daarmee ter beschikking van de bevoegde nationale autoriteiten staan, om ze als staatsmiddelen aan te merken" [65].
138. Op grond hiervan is de Commissie van mening dat de ter beschikking van IFB gestelde bedragen als staatsmiddelen zijn aan te merken.
3.1.1.2. Toerekenbaarheid
3.1.1.3. Wat het criterium van de toerekenbaarheid van de maatregelen aan de betrokken staat betreft, bepaalt het arrest in de zaak Stardust Marine dat het feit "dat een openbaar bedrijf onder staatscontrole staat, op zich dus niet volstaat om door dit bedrijf genomen maatregelen, zoals de onderhavige financiële steunmaatregelen, aan de staat toe te rekenen. Daarnaast dient te worden nagegaan of de overheid op een of andere manier bij de vaststelling van de maatregelen was betrokken." [66]
139. Uit de jurisprudentie van het Hof blijkt dus dat het criterium van de toerekenbaarheid aan de staat van geval tot geval door de Commissie dient te worden onderzocht. Het Hof geeft toe dat het "…juist als gevolg van de bevoorrechte betrekkingen tussen de staat en openbare bedrijven voor derden" in de regel "zeer moeilijk" zal "zijn om in een concreet geval aan te tonen dat door dergelijke bedrijven genomen steunmaatregelen werkelijk in opdracht van de overheid zijn getroffen. Dienaangaande kan niet worden geëist dat op basis van een gedetailleerd onderzoek wordt aangetoond dat de overheid het openbare bedrijf er concreet toe heeft aangezet de betrokken steunmaatregelen te nemen." [67] Op deze gronden dient volgens hetzelfde arrest "... te worden aangenomen dat de toerekenbaarheid aan de staat van een door een openbaar bedrijf genomen steunmaatregel kan worden afgeleid uit een samenstel van aanwijzingen die blijken uit de omstandigheden van de zaak en de context waarin deze maatregel is genomen".
140. In het onderhavige geval moet, wat de toerekenbaarheid betreft, een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de periode vóór de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst op 7 april 2003 en de periode daarna.
141. Wat de periode vóór de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst betreft, rijst de vraag of het besluit van de NMBS om geen betaling te eisen voor de geleverde vervoerdiensten vanaf 2000 aan de Belgische staat is toe te rekenen.
142. De Commissie beschikt over geen gegevens met betrekking tot de vraag hoe en waarom de NMBS heeft besloten geen betaling van haar uitstaande facturen te eisen. Maar omdat deze facturen in de periode van eind 2000 tot begin 2003 systematisch niet blijken te zijn betaald, betwijfelt de Commissie toch of een dergelijk besluit door het middenkader van de onderneming kon worden genomen. Normaal moeten de auditors van de onderneming dit hebben geconstateerd en de bedrijfsleiding — en eventueel ook de met de NMBS belaste regeringscommissaris — hiervan in kennis hebben gesteld. De Commissie heeft in dit stadium dus vermoedens dat het besluit van de NMBS om vanaf eind 2000 geen betaling meer te eisen van haar facturen aan IFB, toerekenbaar is aan de Belgische staat en verzoekt de Belgische autoriteiten haar alle nuttige elementen te bezorgen om na te gaan hoe dit besluit tot stand is gekomen.
143. Wat de periode na de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst betreft, resulteerde de analyse van het dossier door de Commissie in drie concrete aanwijzingen voor toerekenbaarheid van de reddings- en herstructureringsmaatregelen ten behoeve van IFB aan de Belgische staat:
- Het feit dat het herstructureringsplan ter goedkeuring aan de Belgische staat is voorgelegd
- De artikelen in de pers waaruit blijkt dat de Belgische regering gedurende 2003 een sterke invloed op de NMBS had
- Omvang, inhoud en voorwaarden van de kaderovereenkomst.
a) De goedkeuring door de overheid
144. In zijn arresten Van der Kooy [68], Italië/Commissie [69] en Commissie/Frankrijk [70], beschouwde het Hof de steun als staatssteun omdat hij toegekend werd met instemming van de overheid. Terwijl dit element in het arrest Van der Kooy volstaat om de steun als dusdanig te beoordelen, wordt in de arresten Italië/Commissie en Commissie/Frankrijk de goedkeuring gecombineerd met andere elementen die de invloed van de overheid aantonen [71]. De Commissie heeft in haar recente beschikking betreffende het Space Park Development GmbH, de eerste beschikking waarbij zij zich heeft gebaseerd op het Stardust Marine-arrest, geoordeeld dat de steun moest worden aangemerkt als staatssteun, omdat voor de toekenning van de betrokken lening toelating moest worden gegeven door de overheid van de deelstaat Bremen [72]. Daarom is het feit dat een maatregel ter goedkeuring aan de lidstaat wordt voorgelegd een aanwijzing van de toerekenbaarheid aan de staat.
145. In de onderhavige zaak zijn de Raden van Bestuur van de NMBS en IFB op grond van artikel 2 van de kaderovereenkomst verplicht het herstructureringsplan ter goedkeuring voor te leggen aan de Belgische staat. Dit vormt er een extra aanwijzing voor dat de besluiten van de NMBS in onderhavig geval aan de Belgische staat toe te rekenen zijn.
146. De Belgische regering heeft de Commissie inmiddels laten weten dat, in tegenstelling tot hetgeen in de kaderovereenkomst is vastgelegd, de NMBS en IFB geen herstructureringsplan ter goedkeuring aan de Belgische regering hebben voorgelegd, aangezien dit een inbreuk op de commerciële autonomie van de NMBS zou zijn geweest.
147. Volgens de Commissie blijft de indicatie van de toerekenbaarheid desondanks in stand: het lijkt uitgesloten dat de twee partijen bij de overeenkomst, de NMBS en IFB, een dergelijke bepaling in de overeenkomst zouden hebben opgenomen indien er geen invloed in deze zin was van de Belgische regering. Het feit dat de Belgische regering er niet op heeft aangedrongen om formeel over de uitvoering van de herstructurering te worden geraadpleegd volstaat daarom niet om informele beïnvloeding door de Belgische regering bij de voorbereiding van de kaderovereenkomst, waarin de reddings- en herstructureringsmaatregelen al in grote lijnen zijn vervat, uit te sluiten. In ieder geval betekent het feit dat de Belgische staat de controlemiddelen waarover hij beschikte niet heeft gebruikt, niet dat de maatregelen niet aan hem kunnen worden toegerekend.
b) Berichten in de pers
148. Aanwijzingen voor bemoeienis van de Belgische regering in deze zaak zijn tevens in de pers te vinden [73]. Zo wordt in een artikel dat in La libre Belgique van 19 mei 2003 is verschenen [74] de persdienst van de NMBS geciteerd, waarin het feit dat België de reddingsmaatregelen op 19 mei 2003 nog niet bij de Commissie had aangemeld, terwijl de kaderovereenkomst op 7 april 2003 was ondertekend, verklaard wordt door het feit dat de federale overheid zich er nog over moet [moest] uitspreken. In een artikel dat in maart 2003 is verschenen in www.cheminots.be wordt Karel Vinck, destijds gedelegeerd bestuurder van de NMBS, met betrekking tot de dossiers ABX en IFB als volgt geciteerd: "Hij verlangt een voldoende ruime manœuvreerruimte voor het management van de onderneming". Hieruit valt op te maken dat de bedrijfsleiding van de NMBS vond dat de staat zich teveel met deze zaken bemoeide.
c) Omvang, inhoud en voorwaarden van de kaderovereenkomst
149. Meer algemeen herinnert de Commissie eraan dat, volgens punt 56 van hogervermeld arrest-Stardust Marine "elke andere aanwijzing waaruit in het concrete geval blijkt dat de overheid bij de vaststelling van een maatregel is betrokken of dat het onwaarschijnlijk is dat zij hierbij niet betrokken is, mede gelet op de omvang van deze maatregel, op de inhoud ervan of op de eraan verbonden voorwaarden" in aanmerking moet worden genomen om de toerekenbaarheid van een maatregel aan de lidstaat in kwestie vast te stellen. Aangezien het hier omvangrijke herstructureringsmaatregelen betreft, waar de goedkeuring door de Belgische autoriteiten aan vooraf moet gaan, is de Commissie van mening dat de omvang, de inhoud en de voorwaarden van de kaderovereenkomst in dit concrete geval extra aanwijzingen voor de toerekenbaarheid vormen.
d) Conclusie
150. De Commissie is in deze fase dan ook van mening dat de financiële steun voor wat de periode na de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst betreft, aan de staat is toe te rekenen. Er moet dus worden nagegaan of de steun de begunstigde een voordeel heeft opgeleverd dan wel of, integendeel, België heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
3.1.2. Financiële steun aan bepaalde ondernemingen
151. Als blijkt dat het besluit van de NMBS om vanaf eind 2000 geen betaling van haar facturen aan IFB meer te eisen, aan de Belgische staat is toe te rekenen, moet worden nagegaan of deze steun ook door een particulier investeerder in een markteconomie zou zijn verleend.
152. Aangezien het besluit van de NMBS om de kaderovereenkomst met IFB te ondertekenen aan België valt toe te rekenen, moet daarna worden nagegaan of de NMBS, door IFB eerst reddingssteun en vervolgens herstructureringssteun te verlenen, dit bedrijf ten opzichte van andere bedrijven heeft bevoordeeld. Dit is niet het geval indien de NMBS zich tegenover IFB heeft opgesteld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder/bedachtzaam kredietverlener in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. Om deze tweede beoordeling te kunnen maken, moet een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de reddingsmaatregelen en de herstructureringsmaatregelen.
3.1.2.1. Het niet betalen van de facturen van de NMBS door IFB tussen 2000 en 20033
153. Wat het niet betalen van de facturen van de NMBS door IFB betreft, moet worden nagegaan of een bedachtzaam schuldeiser in de plaats van de NMBS zou hebben aanvaard dat IFB zijn facturen niet betaalde, dan wel of een bedachtzaam schuldeiser zich in de plaats van de NMBS tot de rechter zou hebben gewend om de betaling van zijn facturen te verkrijgen.
154. In dit verband moet er allereerst op worden gewezen dat het een gangbare handelspraktijk is om aan een klant die tijdelijke liquiditeitsproblemen heeft, maar die voor het overige economisch gezond is, in afwachting van de betaling van de facturen veeleer een stilzwijgende termijn toe te kennen dan hem onmiddellijk voor het gerecht te dagen.
155. Kennelijk zijn de financiële moeilijkheden van de onderneming pas in de loop van 2002 zichtbaar geworden (zie onderstaande beschrijving van de financiële situatie). Het feit dat IFB in 2001 van de commerciële bank […] een lening van meer dan 4 miljoen euro tegen marktrente heeft gekregen, en dat het eigen vermogen van IFB eind 2001 28 miljoen euro beliep wijst eveneens in die richting.
156. Niettemin kan de Commissie in dit stadium niet uitsluiten dat de NMBS als moedermaatschappij van IFB had moeten inzien dat er in 2001 bij IFB verder stroomopwaarts problemen waren.
157. Pas op zijn vroegst vanaf 2001 had een particulier investeerder dus voorzichtiger kunnen handelen. Het valt moeilijk te zeggen vanaf wanneer een particulier schuldeiser zou hebben getracht terugbetaling van zijn vorderingen of aanvullende zekerheden te verkrijgen; momenteel is de Commissie van oordeel dat dit ogenblik uiterlijk op 19 september 2002 was aangebroken, toen de gedelegeerd bestuurder van IFB twee bedrijfsrevisoren ermee belastte een speciaal verslag over de financiële situatie van IFB op te stellen.
158. Deze gang van zaken heeft geleid tot de ontwikkeling van de kaderovereenkomst, waarin uitdrukkelijk reddings- en herstructureringsmaatregelen zijn vastgelegd. Door aan IFB diensten op het gebied van het spoorvervoer te blijven leveren heeft de NMBS op zijn vroegst in de loop van 2001 en uiterlijk sinds 19 september 2002 aan IFB economische voordelen verschaft, die als staatssteun moeten worden beschouwd. Door IFB niet uiterlijk vanaf dat ogenblik voor het gerecht te dagen ter verkrijging van de betaling van de facturen uit 2000 heeft de NMBS, ook wat het niet betalen van deze facturen betreft, IFB een voordeel verschaft.
159. De NMBS heeft derhalve op zijn vroegst sinds 2001 en uiterlijk sinds 19 september 2002 de facto steun verleend aan IFB; de kaderovereenkomst heeft deze steun alleen maar officieel gemaakt.
3.1.2.2. Reddingsmaatregelen
160. De reddingsmaatregelen zijn hierboven in deel 2 beschreven. Het ging om:
- Verlening van uitstel van betaling voor de schuld van 63 miljoen euro,
- Verlening van een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro
- Verlening van een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro
161. Hierbij moet een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de maatregelen die de NMBS heeft getroffen als schuldeiser van IFB, te weten de verlening van uitstel van betaling voor de reeds bestaande schulden ten belope van 63 miljoen euro, en de maatregelen die de NMBS heeft getroffen als investeerder in IFB, namelijk verlening van een nieuwe kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en verstrekking van een nieuw terug te betalen voorschot van 5 miljoen euro.
162. Zoals Advocaat-generaal Poiares Maduro verklaart, mag het criterium van de particuliere schuldeiser niet worden verward met dat […] van de particuliere investeerder. Waar een investeerder tracht winst te maken door zich bij de betrokken ondernemingen aan te bieden, tracht een schuldeiser van een debiteur in financiële moeilijkheden de terugbetaling te verkrijgen van aan hem verschuldigde bedragen. […] In dat geval is het doorslaggevende criterium niet of er een economisch voordeel is, maar of dit voordeel neerkomt op een behandeling die gunstiger is dan die welke onder soortgelijke omstandigheden door een particuliere schuldeiser zou worden verleend aan een onderneming die bij hem schulden heeft. [75]
163. Hieronder moet daarom worden nagegaan, eerst, of België ten aanzien van de verlening van uitstel van betaling heeft gehandeld als een bedachtzaam schuldeiser in een markteconomie, en vervolgens of België wat het verlenen van de kredietfaciliteit en het terugvorderbare voorschot betreft heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
a) Heeft de NMBS door verlening van uitstel van betaling gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam schuldeiser in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan?
164. Volgens het Gerecht moet het gedrag van de staat worden vergeleken met dat van "een particuliere schuldeiser, die betaling tracht te verkrijgen van de bedragen die hem verschuldigd zijn door een schuldenaar in financiële moeilijkheden". [76] In dit geval moest schuldeiser NMBS dus beslissen of een bedachtzaam schuldeiser IFB geen uitstel van betaling zou hebben verleend en er de voorkeur aan zou hebben gegeven het bedrijf failliet te laten gaan.
165. De kaderovereenkomst is op 7 april 2003 ondertekend, maar het uitstel van betaling dat staatssteun zou kunnen zijn werd al in 2001 verleend. De analyse moet worden gemaakt uit het oogpunt van de feiten waarvan de NMBS destijds op de hoogte was [77].
166. Voor 2002 had IFB exploitatieverliezen geleden ten belope van 47,4 miljoen euro, waarvan 34 miljoen specifieke afschrijvingen waren die reeds bij de exploitatiekosten waren geconstateerd, en uitzonderlijke verliezen van 59,369 miljoen euro. De uitzonderlijke verliezen waren met name het gevolg van de waardevermindering in een aantal, hoofdzakelijk Franse, dochterondernemingen. Ten gevolge van deze verliezen had IFB aan het eind van boekjaar 2002 een negatief eigen vermogen van 84,07 miljoen euro.
167. In geval van faillissement zou de NMBS, die 89,03 % van het aandelenkapitaal van IFB in handen had, eventueel pas tot de resultaten van de liquidatie toegang hebben gehad nadat de schuldeisers waren voldaan. Bovendien hadden haar vorderingen die uit niet-betaalde facturen voortvloeiden waarschijnlijk slechts ten dele kunnen worden voldaan.
168. Dit was overigens de reden waarom de NMBS in haar jaarrekening van 2002 de waarde van deze aandelen en schuldvorderingen op nul had gesteld, [78] omdat, gelet op de financiële situatie van deze groep [d.i. IFB] en in afwachting van de voltooiing van het herstructureringsplan van deze groep binnen de vrachtsector van de NMBS, de commerciële schuldvorderingen en de lopende bestellingen die de NMBS heeft als twijfelachtig [moeten worden] geboekt. [79]
169. De NMBS was op dat ogenblik verreweg de grootste schuldeiser van IFB: volgens de jaarrekening 2003 van IFB had deze onderneming bij kredietinstellingen schulden ten belope van 12 miljoen euro, en schulden bij haar leveranciers, dus voornamelijk bij de NMBS, ten belope van 108 miljoen euro.
170. Bij een faillissement had de NMBS tevens 50 werknemers weer in de onderneming moeten opnemen die bij IFB waren gedetacheerd. Aangezien de NMBS het aantal werknemers juist tracht te verminderen, zou dat een extra nadeel voor de NMBS hebben opgeleverd.
171. Kortom: het faillissement van IFB zou voor de NMBS tot extra kosten hebben geleid, zonder dat de onderneming de zekerheid had dat de uitstaande schulden zouden worden vereffend.
172. Niettemin is het de vraag of de NMBS met het alternatief, namelijk het verlenen van uitstel van betaling, gecombineerd met de betaling van de vertragingsrente tegen de wettelijke rentevoet of tegen de marktrentevoet (naar gelang van de schulden, zie onderstaande beschrijving), de toezegging dat geen beroep zou worden gedaan op de verjaring van de schuldvorderingen en nieuwe investeringen, redelijkerwijs kon verwachten dat IFB voldoende winstgevend zou zijn om haar nieuwe investeringen te compenseren op een voor een particuliere investeerder in een markteconomie aanvaardbaar niveau en om de vooruitzichten op vereffening van de eerdere vorderingen op middellange of lange termijn te verbeteren.
173. In april 2003, op het tijdstip waarop de kaderovereenkomst werd afgesloten, had IFB een begin gemaakt met de herstructurering, die enerzijds een diepgaande herstructurering van de operaties van IFB zelf inhield en anderzijds een afsplitsingsstrategie om de exploitatieverliezen van de Franse dochterondernemingen op te vangen, zoals in deel 2.3.2 is beschreven.
174. Wat de kansen op hernieuwde rentabiliteit van IFB betreft, moet worden geconstateerd dat de financiële moeilijkheden met name het gevolg waren van de expansiestrategie in Frankrijk en slechts in mindere mate te wijten waren aan de structurele problemen van IFB Logistics en IFB Terminals.
175. Niettemin is in de kaderovereenkomst bepaald dat het uitstel van betaling gepaard zou gaan met een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen en een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro. Daarom moest de NMBS, om redelijkerwijs te kunnen verwachten dat haar vorderingen zouden worden betaald, vers kapitaal investeren. Derhalve had een particuliere investeerder slechts uitstel van betaling verleend indien zijn aanvullende investering van 20 miljoen euro aan vers kapitaal een investering met een aanvaardbaar rendement was.
176. Het uitstel van betaling moet dan ook tezamen worden onderzocht met de door de NMBS in de kaderovereenkomst genomen investeringsbesluiten, aangezien de maatregelen, in de zin van de jurisprudentie in de zaak-BP Chemicals [80], een geheel vormen.
b) Heeft de NMBS door toekenning van een kredietfaciliteit en van een terugvorderbaar voorschot gehandeld zoals een bedachtzame investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan?
177. Wat de toekenning van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en de toekenning van het terugvorderbare voorschot van 5 miljoen euro betreft, had de NMBS, aangezien zij niet als investeerder optrad en dus geen schuldeiser van IFB was, de vrije keus om dit geld in IFB dan wel elders te investeren, en was zij dus een investeerder.
178. Derhalve moet worden nagegaan of de NMBS heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. Volgens de jurisprudentie van het Hof dient te worden beoordeeld of in soortgelijke omstandigheden een particulier investeerder die qua omvang vergelijkbaar is met de NMBS, ertoe zou kunnen worden gebracht een zo belangrijke kapitaalinbreng te doen. [81]
179. Het Hof heeft verduidelijkt dat een particulier investeerder, waarmee de deelneming van een publiek investeerder die doelstellingen van economisch beleid nastreeft, moet worden vergeleken, zich weliswaar niet noodzakelijkerwijs zal gedragen als een gewone investeerder die zijn kapitaal belegt om daaruit op min of meer korte termijn een rendement te halen, doch dat hij zich ten minste zal moeten gedragen als een particuliere holding of een particuliere groep ondernemingen met een algemene of sectoriële structuurpolitiek, die wordt geleid door het uitzicht op rendement op langere termijn [82]. Het Gerecht heeft de door de Commissie toe te passen beoordelingsmethode nauwkeuriger omschreven. Het heeft verduidelijkt dat de Commissie verplicht is "alle relevante elementen van de litigieuze transactie en haar context volledig te onderzoeken", teneinde te weten of de staat heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. [83]
180. In dit geval moet dus de rentabiliteit van het optreden van de NMBS worden vastgesteld, wat veronderstelt dat wordt nagegaan of de investering in IFB een normale winstmarge zou opleveren.
181. De NMBS heeft in april 2003, via reddingsmaatregelen, besloten 20 miljoen euro vrij te maken voor IFB in de vorm van een lening (kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro).
182. De kaderovereenkomst, waarin reddingsmaatregelen waren vastgelegd, is op 7 april 2003 gesloten. De investering van 20 miljoen euro die op dat ogenblik bij wijze van reddingsmaatregel werd gedaan, moet worden geanalyseerd uit het oogpunt van de feiten waarvan de NMBS destijds op de hoogte was [84].
183. Bij het bepalen of de rentevoet voor een lening is afgestemd op de marktomstandigheden maakt de Commissie gewoonlijk een vergelijking met de referentierente die is vastgesteld voor de desbetreffende lidstaat op de desbetreffende datum [85]. Aangezien de leningen in kwestie tegen de marktrente worden vergoed, en ten dele zelfs tegen een hogere rentevoet dan de marktrente, lijkt deze op het eerste gezicht geen steunelement te bevatten. Niettemin moet worden geconstateerd dat IFB op het tijdstip waarop de leningen werden toegekend een onderneming met ernstige financiële moeilijkheden was. Het lijkt onwaarschijnlijk dat het bedrijf op de kapitaalmarkt een lening had kunnen krijgen tegen vergelijkbare voorwaarden als de door de NMBS geboden voorwaarden. Een bank had dus zeer waarschijnlijk een hogere rente verlangd dan de door de NMBS gevraagde rente of had zelfs geweigerd IFB een lening te geven. Het besluit van de NMBS om voor de bestaande schuldvorderingen uitstel van betaling te verlenen is trouwens een aanwijzing voor de moeilijkheden die IFB heeft moeten ondervinden om zich elders te herfinancieren.
184. De Belgische autoriteiten zijn van mening dat het feit dat IFB in juli 2003, dus na de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst, een lening van 2 miljoen euro van de ING-bank heeft gekregen, aantoont dat particuliere banken geen vergoeding vroegen die hoger was dan de marktrentevoet.
185. Dit argument is om twee redenen niet overtuigend. Ten eerste is het bedrag van 2 miljoen euro zeer laag in vergelijking met de verbintenissen van de NMBS, die voorzagen in investeringen ten belope van 20 miljoen euro plus de mogelijkheid om de schuld van 63 miljoen euro om te zetten in kapitaal. Voorts heeft ING deze lening pas toegestaan nadat de NMBS, door de kaderovereenkomst te ondertekenen, zich ertoe verbonden had het voortbestaan van IFB te garanderen.
186. Geconstateerd moet daarom worden dat de NMBS door de toekenning van leningen tegen een lagere rente dan die welke voor de financiële situatie van IFB adequaat zou zijn geweest, niet heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
187. De Belgische regering van haar kant is van mening dat de NMBS heeft gehandeld zoals iedere moedermaatschappij, waarvan een dochteronderneming in moeilijkheden verkeert, zou hebben gedaan, zonder dit standpunt nader toe te lichten. De Commissie merkt op dit punt op dat België dit standpunt niet heeft onderbouwd en met name niet heeft aangetoond dat de nieuwe investering noodzakelijk was om te kunnen verwachten er een hoger bedrag dan al haar bestaande en nieuwe vorderingen aan over te houden.
c) Conclusie ten aanzien van de reddingsmaatregelen
188. Bij wijze van conclusie is de Commissie in dit stadium van oordeel dat de NMBS, wat de toekenning van een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en de toekenning van een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro betreft, niet heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. Aangezien de verlening van uitstel van betaling voor een particuliere schuldeiser slechts redelijk was indien de investering dit eveneens was, volgt hieruit dat de NMBS, wat de verlening van uitstel van betaling aan IFB betreft, evenmin heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
3.1.2.3. Herstructureringsmaatregelen
189. De herstructureringsmaatregelen zijn in deel 2 hierboven beschreven. Ter herinnering zij erop gewezen dat het gaat om:
- de omzetting van de schulden ten bedrage van 63 miljoen euro waarvoor uitstel van betaling is toegestaan, in maatschappelijk kapitaal;
- de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal;
- de omzetting van de gekapitaliseerde rente in verband met het uitstel van betaling ten bedrage van 11 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal;
- de omzetting van de gekapitaliseerde rente op het terugvorderbare voorschot van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal;
- de injectie van 5 miljoen euro door de inbreng in natura van de participatie van de NMBS in TRW.
190. De kapitaalverhoging zal dus in totaal 96,5 miljoen euro bedragen. Daar IFB op dit ogenblik een negatief eigen vermogen van 72,6 miljoen euro heeft, zal het bedrijf door de kapitaalverhoging beschikken over 23,8 miljoen euro eigen kapitaal.
191. Bij deze maatregelen moet een onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de maatregelen die de NMBS als schuldeiser van IFB heeft genomen, namelijk de omzetting van de bestaande schulden van 63 miljoen euro en van de bijbehorende rente van 11 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal, en de maatregelen die de NMBS als investeerder in IFB heeft genomen, namelijk de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en van de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal en de injectie van vers kapitaal van 5 miljoen euro.
192. Wat betreft de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal, zou kunnen worden aangevoerd dat de NMBS op het moment van de omzetting geen investeerder meer was, maar schuldeiser. Daarmee wordt echter het feit genegeerd dat in de kaderovereenkomst was bepaald dat de kredietfaciliteit eventueel in maatschappelijk kapitaal zou worden omgezet (zie de beschrijving in deel 2) en dat de kredietfaciliteit slechts een tijdelijke maatregel was. Bijgevolg moet worden aangenomen dat de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit in maatschappelijk kapitaal te vergelijken is met een investering.
a) Heeft de NMBS gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam schuldeiser in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan, door haar schuldvorderingen van 63 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 11 miljoen euro om te zetten in maatschappelijk kapitaal?
193. Door haar schuldvorderingen van 63 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 11 miljoen euro om te zetten in maatschappelijk kapitaal, ziet de NMBS af van de terugbetaling van deze schulden. Daartegenover staat dat zij recht zal hebben op de dividenden die IFB aan zijn eigenaars zal uitkeren, en dat zij aandelen verwerft.
194. Zoals hierboven is aangetoond, dient in dit stadium te worden aangenomen dat een bedachtzaam particulier schuldeiser het door de NMBS toegekende uitstel van betaling niet zou hebben toegekend, maar het faillissement van IFB zou hebben aangevraagd en zou hebben getracht de betaling van de schuldvorderingen in het kader van de collectieve procedure te verkrijgen.
195. Bijgevolg zou een bedachtzaam particulier schuldeiser zijn vorderingen ook niet hebben omgezet in maatschappelijk kapitaal van een onderneming die slechts kon overleven indien hij tegelijkertijd ook vers kapitaal zou verstrekken. De NMBS heeft dus, door haar vorderingen in maatschappelijk kapitaal om te zetten, niet gehandeld zoals een particuliere schuldeiser in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
b) Heeft de NMBS gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan, door de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro om te zetten in maatschappelijk kapitaal en door 5 miljoen euro vers kapitaal te verstrekken?
196. Er moet worden nagegaan of de NMBS heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan wat betreft de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en van de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal, alsmede de kapitaalverhoging van IFB ten bedrage van 5 miljoen euro.
197. Volgens de jurisprudentie van het Hof dient te worden beoordeeld of in soortgelijke omstandigheden een particuliere investeerder die qua omvang vergelijkbaar is met de NMBS, ertoe zou kunnen worden gebracht een zo belangrijke kapitaalinbreng te doen [86].
198. Het Hof heeft verduidelijkt dat een particuliere investeerder, waarmee de deelneming van een publieke investeerder die doelstellingen van economisch beleid nastreeft, moet worden vergeleken, zich weliswaar niet noodzakelijkerwijs zal gedragen als een gewone investeerder die zijn kapitaal belegt om daaruit op min of meer korte termijn een rendement te halen, doch dat hij zich ten minste zal moeten gedragen als een particuliere holding of een particuliere groep ondernemingen met een algemene of sectoriële structuurpolitiek, die wordt geleid door het uitzicht op rendement op langere termijn [87]. Het Gerecht heeft de door de Commissie toe te passen beoordelingsmethode nauwkeuriger omschreven. Het heeft verduidelijkt dat de Commissie verplicht is "een volledig onderzoek uit te voeren van alle relevante elementen van de litigieuze transactie en haar context", teneinde te weten of de staat heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. [88]
199. In dit geval moet dus de rentabiliteit van het optreden van de NMBS worden vastgesteld, wat veronderstelt dat wordt aangetoond dat de investering in IFB een normale winstmarge zal opleveren.
200. Door haar beslissing om de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro, die een tijdelijke reddingsmaatregel was, in een kapitaalverhoging om te zetten, zal de NMBS deze investering een duurzaam karakter geven.
201. Met haar beslissing aan deze kapitaalverhoging het bedrag van 5 miljoen euro toe te voegen, heeft zij een aanvullende investering van 5 miljoen verricht.
202. Over de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en van de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal en het beginsel van de aanvullende kapitaalverhoging van 5 miljoen euro is in het voorjaar 2005 een beslissing genomen; bij het onderzoek ervan moet dus worden uitgegaan van de feiten waarvan de NMBS op dat ogenblik kennis had. [89]
203. Deze twee maatregelen moeten worden vergeleken met de beslissing van een particuliere investeerder om deel te nemen in een kapitaalverhoging van IFB.
204. De Commissie neemt in de eerste plaats nota van de afwezigheid van een particuliere investeerder die, met de NMBS, zou hebben deelgenomen in de kapitaalverhoging van IFB.
205. De Belgische regering is van oordeel dat de NMBS heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan. Om dat aan te tonen, geeft zij het volgende voorbeeld: indien de NMBS op 1 januari 2004 nieuw kapitaal aan IFB had verstrekt door omzetting van de schulden van IFB ten aanzien van de NMBS (ca. 79 miljoen euro op dat ogenblik) en een aanvullende inbreng van ca. 21 miljoen euro, had IFB aan het begin van het boekjaar over ongeveer 16 miljoen euro eigen vermogen beschikt. Bovendien zou het bedrijf een bedrijfswinst van 5,74 miljoen euro (rendement van 36 % op eigen vermogen) en een lopende winst vóór belasting van meer dan 7,18 miljoen euro (45 % op eigen kapitaal) hebben gemaakt. De operationele winstmarge op de omzet zou dan ca. 7 % hebben bedragen in 2004. Aangezien het resultaat over 2004 sterk is beïnvloed door het gebruik en de overname van bepaalde in 2001 en 2002 gemaakte voorzieningen voor de verwachte verliezen van de Franse dochtermaatschappijen, stelt de Belgische regering voor deze buitengewone gebeurtenissen te neutraliseren, waardoor voor 2004 een operationele winstmarge op de omzet van 2,9 % overblijft. De Belgische regering heeft geen raming van de winst van IFB voor de volgende jaren verstrekt.
206. De Commissie is van oordeel dat de ontwikkeling van IFB sinds 2003 zeker aantoont dat het bedrijf economisch levensvatbaar is. De toets van de particuliere investeerder in een markteconomie heeft echter niet alleen betrekking op de economische levensvatbaarheid van een onderneming, maar ook op haar rentabiliteit. Volgens het Hof "moet worden beoordeeld of een particuliere aandeelhouder in gelijkaardige omstandigheden, op grond van de te verwachten rentabiliteit en afgezien van elke overweging van sociale aard of van regionaal of sectorieel beleid, een dergelijke kapitaalinbreng zou hebben gedaan" [90]. Deze mogelijkheid van rentabiliteit moet ten minste gelijk zijn aan die van "een particuliere holding of een particuliere groep ondernemingen met een algemene of sectoriële structuurpolitiek, die wordt geleid door het uitzicht op rendement op langere termijn". [91]
207. Bij de beoordeling van de normale vergoeding wordt met name rekening gehouden met de gemiddelde rentabiliteit van de concurrenten. In dit verband heeft de Belgische regering de Commissie meegedeeld dat de omzet en de rentabiliteit van de concurrenten van IFB als volgt waren (in miljoenen euro's):
| Omzet 2003 | Winst 2003 | Winst 2003 in % | Omzet 2004 | Winst 2004 | Winst 2004 in % |
CEMAT | 164,1 | 1,4 | 0,9 | 176,6 | 3,9 | 2,2 |
CNC | 193,5 | - 17,0 | - 8,8 | 164,4 | - 20,6 | - 12,5 |
HUPAC | 195,2 | 5,7 | 2,9 | 225,6 | 6,0 | 2,7 |
ICF | 276,5 | 0,5 | 0,2 | 261,1 | - 3,7 | - 1,4 |
Kombiverkehr | 289,2 | 0,8 | 0,3 | n.v.t. | n.v.t. | n.v.t. |
Novatrans | 109,0 | - 7,1 | - 6,5 | 102,5 | - 5,5 | - 5,4 |
208. Hierbij zij opgemerkt dat in deze tabel niet het rendement van de grote concurrenten Hesse-Noordnatie, Danzas, Ziegler, en Schenker wordt weergegeven en dat de meeste van de door de Belgische regering vermelde ondernemingen in 2004 verlies hebben geleden.
209. De door de Belgische regering verstrekte cijfers kunnen dus niet worden gebruikt om te beoordelen of het rendement van IFB een normaal rendement is. Bij gebrek aan een adequaat vergelijkingscijfer constateert de Commissie dat een rendement van 2,9 % een zeer laag rendement is, want het komt min of meer overeen met het rendement van overheidsobligaties. Aan een investering in IFB is echter een duidelijk hoger risico verbonden dan aan overheidsobligaties.
210. Bijgevolg is de Commissie van oordeel dat het rendement van een investering in IFB niet voldoende zou zijn om een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie ertoe over te halen een dergelijke investering te doen. Een bedachtzaam investeerder zou dus niet de investeringen hebben gedaan die de NMBS in IFB heeft gedaan.
c) Conclusie wat de herstructureringsmaatregelen betreft
211. De Commissie is bijgevolg in dit stadium van oordeel dat de NMBS niet heeft gehandeld zoals een particuliere schuldeiser in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan, door de schulden van 63 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 11 miljoen om te zetten in maatschappelijk kapitaal. Zij is van oordeel dat de NMBS evenmin heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan wat betreft de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal en wat betreft de injectie van 5 miljoen euro in IFB.
3.1.3 Vervalsing van de mededinging en ongunstige beïnvloeding van het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten
212. De Commissie moet een analyse maken van de situatie op de desbetreffende markt en van het marktaandeel van de begunstigde ondernemingen op deze markt, alsmede van het effect dat de financiële steun zal hebben op de concurrentiesituatie [92].
213. In dit geval is de financiële steun toegekend aan een onderneming die actief is op voor mededinging opengestelde markten en die zich met andere marktdeelnemers uit diverse lidstaten in een concurrentiesituatie bevindt, zoals hierboven in het deel "beschrijving" is aangetoond. De financiële steun vervalst dus de mededinging of dreigt die te vervalsen en beïnvloedt ongunstig het handelsverkeer tussen de lidstaten of dreigt dit ongunstig te beïnvloeden.
3.1.4. Conclusie: aanwezigheid van staatssteun
214. Bij wijze van conclusie is de Commissie in dit stadium van oordeel dat de NMBS niet heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam schuldeiser in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan wat betreft het uitstel van betaling en de omzetting van de op 31 januari 2003 vervallen en niet betaalde schuldvorderingen ten bedrage van 63 miljoen euro, en dat zij niet heeft gehandeld zoals een bedachtzaam investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan wat betreft de toekenning van een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro, de toekenning van een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro, de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal, alsmede wat betreft de injectie van vers kapitaal ten bedrage van 5 miljoen euro.
3.2. Verenigbaarheid van de steun
215. In artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het EG-Verdrag is het volgende bepaald: "met de gemeenschappelijke markt zijn verenigbaar: steunmaatregelen om de ontwikkeling van bepaalde vormen van economische bedrijvigheid of van bepaalde regionale economieën te vergemakkelijken, mits de voorwaarden waaronder het handelsverkeer plaatsvindt daardoor niet zodanig worden veranderd dat het gemeenschappelijk belang wordt geschaad".
216. De door België via de NMBS toegekende steun zou met de gemeenschappelijke markt verenigbaar kunnen zijn op grond van artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), zoals door de Commissie geïnterpreteerd in haar Communautaire richtsnoeren voor reddings- en herstructureringssteun aan ondernemingen in moeilijkheden (hierna: de richtsnoeren) [93].
217. Om reddings- en herstructureringssteun te kunnen ontvangen, moet een onderneming om te beginnen in aanmerking komen voor de toepassing van de richtsnoeren. Om daarvoor in aanmerking te komen, mag de onderneming geen nieuw opgerichte onderneming zijn en moet het een onderneming in moeilijkheden zijn.
218. Geen nieuw opgerichte onderneming. In punt 12 van de richtsnoeren van 2004 wordt in dit verband het volgende bepaald (waarbij de richtsnoeren van 1999, punt 7, worden overgenomen en verduidelijkt):
Voor de toepassing van de onderhavige richtsnoeren komt een pas opgerichte onderneming niet voor reddings- of herstructureringssteun in aanmerking, zelfs niet wanneer haar aanvankelijke financiële positie onzeker is. Dit geldt bijvoorbeeld voor ondernemingen die uit de liquidatie van een bestaande onderneming ontstaan of die de activa van een dergelijke onderneming overnemen. Een onderneming wordt in beginsel als een nieuw opgerichte onderneming beschouwd gedurende de eerste drie jaar na de aanvang van activiteiten in de betrokken sector.
219. Om te beginnen rijst dus de vraag of IFB een nieuw opgerichte onderneming is. Zoals hierboven in deel 2 is beschreven, is IFB op 1 april 1998 opgericht door de fusie van drie andere maatschappijen, die respectievelijk in 1906, 1923 en 1967 waren opgericht.
220. Zoals hierboven in punt 3.1.2.1 is uitgelegd, was het eerste voordeel dat door de NMBS aan IFB werd toegekend, de stilzwijgende toekenning, ten vroegste vanaf 2001, van een uitstel van betaling voor de door de NMBS geleverde, maar door IFB niet betaalde diensten.
221. De onderneming IFB is op 1 april 1998 opgericht door de fusie van drie bestaande maatschappijen. In dit stadium is het niet duidelijk of de onderneming de rechtspersoonlijkheid van een van deze drie maatschappijen voortzet. Indien dit het geval zou zijn, zou IFB in 2001 duidelijk een onderneming van meer dan drie jaar oud zijn.
222. Indien IFB de rechtspersoonlijkheid van een van deze maatschappijen niet zou voortzetten, maar een op 1 april 1998 nieuw opgerichte onderneming zou zijn, zou zij op 1 april 2001 drie jaar oud zijn. In deze veronderstelling zou zij pas vanaf 1 april 2001 in aanmerking komen voor herstructureringssteun.
223. De Commissie uit dus twijfels over de vraag of IFB een onderneming is die in aanmerking komt voor herstructureringssteun, en verzoekt de Belgische autoriteiten haar alle nuttige informatie te verstrekken zodat zij kan nagaan of IFB in het licht van deze overwegingen een onderneming is die in aanmerking komt voor herstructureringssteun.
224. Onderneming in moeilijkheden Er is geen communautaire definitie van een onderneming in moeilijkheden. In de richtsnoeren wordt in punt 5 (versie van 1999), respectievelijk punt 10 (versie van 2004) aangenomen dat een vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid, zoals de maatschappij IFB, die een vennootschap op aandelen is, in elk geval als onderneming in moeilijkheden wordt beschouwd wanneer meer dan de helft van het maatschappelijk kapitaal verdwenen is en meer dan een kwart van dit kapitaal verloren is gegaan gedurende de afgelopen twaalf maanden. De jaarrekening over 2002 geeft een maatschappelijk kapitaal van 48 miljoen euro te zien en lopende verliezen vóór belasting van 50 miljoen euro. Bijgevolg was het maatschappelijk kapitaal verdwenen toen de NMBS in april 2003 besloot reddingssteun toe te kennen. Aangezien op dat ogenblik meer dan de helft van het maatschappelijk kapitaal verdwenen was, waarvan meer dan een kwart in de laatste twaalf maanden, is IFB een onderneming in moeilijkheden in de zin van de richtsnoeren.
225. De richtsnoeren zijn dus van toepassing. Er moet worden onderzocht of zij bij de toekenning van steun door de NMBS aan IFB zijn nageleefd. In dit verband moet in de eerste plaats worden onderzocht of het bij ten minste een deel van de steun ging om met de richtsnoeren verenigbare reddingssteun.
3.2.1. Verenigbaarheid als reddingssteun
226. Alleen maatregelen die bestaan in kassteun, zouden als reddingssteun verenigbaar kunnen zijn. In het onderhavige geval bestaat de kassteun in de toekenning van een stilzwijgend uitstel van betaling, ten vroegste in 2001, ten laatste op 19 september 2002, dat op 7 april 2003 uitdrukkelijk uitstel van betaling is geworden, de kredietfaciliteit en het terugvorderbare voorschot.
227. In de eerste plaats rijst de vraag welke versie van de richtsnoeren van toepassing is. De recentste versie van deze richtsnoeren is op 10 oktober 2004 in werking getreden. Daarin wordt in punt 7 "Datum van toepassing en duur" bepaald:
102. De Commissie zal deze richtsnoeren toepassen met ingang van 10 oktober 2004 tot 9 oktober 2009.
103. Aanmeldingen die door de Commissie vóór 10 oktober 2004 zijn geregistreerd, zullen worden getoetst aan de criteria die gelden op het tijdstip van de aanmelding.
104. De Commissie zal onderzoeken of reddings- of herstructureringssteun die zonder haar toestemming — en dus in strijd met artikel 88, lid 3, van het Verdrag — is toegekend, verenigbaar is met de gemeenschappelijke markt op basis van de onderhavige richtsnoeren wanneer die steun geheel of gedeeltelijk na de bekendmaking van deze richtsnoeren in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie is toegekend. In alle overige gevallen zal zij het onderzoek verrichten op basis van de op het tijdstip van de toekenning van de steun geldende richtsnoeren.
228. De kassteun is ten vroegste in 2001 of in de loop van 2002 en in zijn geheel op 7 april 2003 toegekend zonder voorafgaande kennisgeving aan de Commissie en dus in strijd met artikel 88, lid 3, van het EG-Verdrag. De vraag of hij als reddingssteun verenigbaar is, waarbij de andere, als herstructureringssteun aan te merken maatregelen buiten beschouwing worden gelaten, zal dus worden beoordeeld op basis van de richtsnoeren van 1999.
229. In punt 23 van de richtsnoeren van 1999, die van toepassing zijn op de reddingssteun die de NMBS mogelijkerwijs in 2001, zeker in 2002 en 2003, aan IFB heeft toegekend, worden de vijf voorwaarden bepaald waaraan reddingssteun moet voldoen om met de gemeenschappelijke markt verenigbaar te zijn. Deze vijf voorwaarden zijn:
a) bestaan in kassteun in de vorm van leninggaranties of leningen. In beide gevallen moet de rente op zijn minst vergelijkbaar zijn met de rentepercentages die gelden voor leningen aan gezonde ondernemingen en met name aan de referentiepercentages die door de Commissie zijn vastgesteld;
b) gekoppeld zijn aan leningen die over een periode van ten hoogste twaalf maanden na de laatste storting aan de onderneming moeten worden terugbetaald; eventueel kan de terugbetaling van de lening die in het kader van de reddingssteun is verstrekt, worden gedekt door herstructureringssteun die in een later stadium door de Commissie is goedgekeurd;
c) worden gerechtvaardigd door dringende sociale omstandigheden en geen ernstig "spill-over"-effect naar andere lidstaten hebben;
d) bij de aanmelding ervan gepaard gaan met een toezegging van de lidstaat, de Commissie binnen zes maanden na de goedkeuring van de reddingssteun, ofwel een herstructureringsplan, ofwel een liquidatieplan voor te leggen, dan wel aan te tonen dat de lening volledig is afgelost en/of dat de garantie is ingetrokken;
e) zich wat het bedrag betreft beperken tot hetgeen noodzakelijk is voor de exploitatie van de onderneming gedurende de periode waarvoor de steun is goedgekeurd (bijvoorbeeld dekking van de loonkosten, lopende leveringen).
3.2.1.1. Steun die bestaat in kassteun
230. Er zij aan herinnerd dat de reddingsmaatregelen bestaan in een uitstel van betaling voor schuldvorderingen voor een totaal bedrag van 63 miljoen euro, een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro, dat is toegekend, maar niet door IFB is gebruikt, en een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro.
231. Bijgevolg bestaat de steun in kassteun, die bestaat uit een uitstel van betaling, een terugvorderbaar voorschot en een kredietfaciliteit.
3.2.1.2. Steun die gekoppeld is aan leningen die over een periode van ten hoogste twaalf maanden na de laatste storting aan de onderneming moeten worden terugbetaald
232. De in de kaderovereenkomst vastgestelde terugbetalingsperiode is twaalf maanden. De Belgische regering heeft de Commissie echter meegedeeld dat deze periode stilzwijgend is verlengd tot het tijdstip waarop de kapitaalverhoging plaatsvindt.
233. Bovendien is het voordeel dat voortvloeit uit het uitstel van betaling, reeds ten vroegste in de loop van 2001, ten laatste op 19 december 2002, toegekend. De Commissie is bijgevolg van oordeel dat aan dit criterium niet wordt voldaan en dat de kassteun niet als reddingssteun kan worden goedgekeurd.
3.2.1.3. Conclusie
234. Bij wijze van conclusie is de Commissie in dit stadium van oordeel dat de kassteun die de NMBS aan IFB heeft toegekend, als reddingssteun niet met de gemeenschappelijke markt verenigbaar is op grond van artikel 87, lid 3, onder c), van het Verdrag. Hij zou als herstructureringssteun echter wel met de gemeenschappelijke markt verenigbaar kunnen zijn.
3.2.2. Verenigbaarheid van de herstructureringssteun
235. Opnieuw rijst de vraag welke versie van de richtsnoeren van toepassing is. Er zij aan herinnerd dat de recentste versie van deze richtsnoeren op 10 oktober 2004 in werking is getreden. Daarin wordt in punt 7 "Datum van toepassing en duur" bepaald:
102. De Commissie zal deze richtsnoeren toepassen met ingang van 10 oktober 2004 tot 9 oktober 2009.
103. Aanmeldingen die door de Commissie vóór 10 oktober 2004 zijn geregistreerd, zullen worden getoetst aan de criteria die gelden op het tijdstip van de aanmelding.
104. De Commissie zal onderzoeken of reddings- of herstructureringssteun die zonder haar toestemming — en dus in strijd met artikel 88, lid 3, van het Verdrag — is toegekend, verenigbaar is met de gemeenschappelijke markt op basis van de onderhavige richtsnoeren wanneer die steun geheel of gedeeltelijk na de bekendmaking van deze richtsnoeren in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie is toegekend. In alle overige gevallen zal zij het onderzoek verrichten op basis van de op het tijdstip van de toekenning van de steun geldende richtsnoeren.
236. De kassteun is gedeeltelijk ten vroegste in de loop van 2001, ten laatste op 19 september 2002, en in zijn geheel op 7 april 2003 toegekend zonder voorafgaande kennisgeving aan de Commissie en dus in strijd met artikel 88, lid 3, van het EG-Verdrag. De omzetting ervan in kapitaal was gepland sinds de sluiting van de kaderovereenkomst op 7 april 2003, maar heeft tot op heden niet plaatsgevonden.
237. Aangezien de NMBS de kassteun zonder voorafgaande goedkeuring van de Commissie heeft verleend, moet punt 104 van de richtsnoeren van 2004 worden toegepast om te bepalen welke richtsnoeren op dit geval van toepassing zijn. De kassteun is gedeeltelijk ten vroegste in de loop van 2001, ten laatste op 19 september 2002, en voor de rest op 7 april 2003 toegekend, dat wil zeggen vóór de publicatie van de richtsnoeren van 2004 in het Publicatieblad. Indien de steun beperkt zou blijven tot kassteun, zouden dus de richtsnoeren van 1999 moeten worden toegepast, want de toekenning van de steun zou vóór de publicatie van de richtsnoeren van 2004 hebben plaatsgevonden.
238. De omzetting van de vorderingen in kapitaal is echter een latere maatregel, waardoor de aard van de voordien aan IFB toegekende voordelen wordt gewijzigd. In dit verband wordt in de kaderovereenkomst melding gemaakt van het voornemen van de partijen om over te gaan tot deze omzetting, evenwel onder voorbehoud van met name de goedkeuring van het herstructureringsplan door beide raden van bestuur en door de Belgische staat, alsmede onder voorbehoud van goedkeuring door de aandeelhouders van IFB. In dit stadium is dus niet aangetoond dat de maatregel definitief is toegekend vóór de publicatie van de richtsnoeren van 2004, in die zin dat de bevoegde autoriteit zich er door een juridisch bindend document toe heeft verbonden de steun vóór die datum toe te kennen [94]. Indien dit niet het geval was, en aangezien de omzetting van de vorderingen in kapitaal niet vóór 10 oktober 2004 ter kennis is gebracht, zouden de richtsnoeren van 2004 van toepassing zijn.
239. De Belgische autoriteiten hebben de Commissie er per brief van 28 januari 2005 van in kennis gesteld dat de NMBS in 2005 of 2006 een nieuw voordeel van 5 miljoen euro zou toekennen in de vorm van een kapitaalverhoging door inbreng in natura. In dat geval zou na 10 oktober 2004 kennisgeving zijn gedaan van steun. Krachtens punt 103 van de richtsnoeren van 2004 zouden dan de richtsnoeren van 2004 op die nieuwe kennisgeving moeten worden toegepast.
240. De Commissie moet zich uitspreken over alle maatregelen waarvan haar kennisgeving is gedaan; zij baseert dus haar juridische beoordeling op de richtsnoeren van 2004. Zij vestigt echter de aandacht van de Belgische regering en van belanghebbende derden op het feit dat, indien de NMBS besluit geen nieuw voordeel aan IFB toe te kennen, en indien het bewijs zou worden geleverd dat de NMBS zich ertoe verbonden had haar vorderingen vóór de publicatie van de richtsnoeren van 2004 in kapitaal om te zetten, de Commissie de door de NMBS aan IFB toegekende steun in haar eindbesluit zou moeten onderzoeken op basis van de richtsnoeren van 1999. De hierna op basis van de tekst van 2004 geuite twijfels gelden, mutatis mutandis, ook voor de tekst van 1999.
241. In punt 3.2.2 van de richtsnoeren van 2004 worden de voorwaarden voor de goedkeuring van herstructureringssteun omschreven. De voorwaarden zijn als volgt:
- Het herstructureringsplan dient binnen een redelijk tijdsbestek de levensvatbaarheid op lange termijn van de onderneming te herstellen.
- Er moeten maatregelen worden genomen om de nadelige gevolgen voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken.
- De steun moet worden beperkt tot het strikt noodzakelijke minimum om de herstructurering mogelijk te maken.
- De Commissie moet in staat worden gesteld zich aan de hand van regelmatige en gedetailleerde verslagen ervan te vergewissen dat het herstructureringsplan naar behoren wordt uitgevoerd.
- Er mag slechts eenmaal herstructureringssteun worden toegekend.
3.2.2.1. Herstructureringsplan
242. Voor de toekenning van herstructureringssteun geldt als voorwaarde dat een herstructureringsplan ten uitvoer wordt gelegd dat binnen een redelijk tijdsbestek de levensvatbaarheid op lange termijn van de onderneming dient te herstellen op grond van realistische veronderstellingen betreffende de toekomstige bedrijfsomstandigheden.
243. In de punten 32 tot en met 34 van de richtsnoeren worden de minimumvoorwaarden voor de goedkeuring van een herstructureringsplan door de Commissie bepaald. Het herstructureringsplan moet met name de volgende elementen bevatten:
- een marktstudie;
- een beschrijving van de omstandigheden die tot de moeilijkheden van de onderneming hebben geleid, zodat kan worden beoordeeld of de in het plan voorgestelde maatregelen passend zijn om de levensvatbaarheid van de onderneming te herstellen;
- een beschrijving van de voorgenomen veranderingen die ervoor moeten zorgen dat de onderneming, wanneer de herstructurering voltooid is, in staat is alle kosten, met inbegrip van aflossingen en financiële lasten, te dekken, en op eigen kracht op de markt te concurreren.
244. De Belgische regering heeft in december 2003 een herstructureringsplan voor IFB voorgelegd en heeft dit plan naderhand gedetailleerd. Het bevat de genoemde elementen en wordt in detail beschreven in deel 2 van deze beschikking.
245. Dit plan bevat een analyse van de logistiekmarkt en van de overslagmarkt, alsmede van de positie van IFB op die markten. In het plan worden de oorzaken van de moeilijkheden van IFB beschreven. Ze vinden met name hun oorsprong in een slecht aangepakt expansiebeleid in Frankrijk en in het slechte beheer van de activiteiten "IFB Terminals" en "IFB Logistics".
246. Ten slotte worden in dit plan de voorgenomen veranderingen beschreven die ervoor moeten zorgen dat de onderneming, wanneer de herstructurering voltooid is, in staat is op eigen kracht al haar kosten te dekken. De voorgenomen veranderingen zijn met name de opheffing van de Franse dochterondernemingen, alsmede een herstructurering van de activiteiten "IFB Logistics" en "IFB Terminals". Deze herstructureringen impliceren met name concentratie op rentabele onderdelen van het aanbod, een nieuwe collectieve overeenkomst en een reorganisatie van de terminals.
247. De tenuitvoerlegging van dit herstructureringsplan is in 2005 met succes voltooid.
3.2.2.2. Economische levensvatbaarheid van de onderneming
248. Het herstructureringsplan bevat de door IFB geplande maatregelen om zijn economische levensvatbaarheid te herstellen. Zoals hierboven werd beschreven, heeft IFB in 2003 zijn financiële doelstellingen niet kunnen verwezenlijken. Vanaf het boekjaar 2004 heeft de onderneming echter de in het herstructureringsplan geformuleerde doelstellingen kunnen bereiken en heeft zij zelfs een hogere winst gerealiseerd dan werd beoogd. Deze goede ontwikkeling heeft zich in 2005 voortgezet.
249. IFB is erin geslaagd om het vervoerde vrachtvolume sinds de aanvang van het herstructureringsprogramma aanzienlijk te vergroten (zie de beschrijving hierboven in deel 2). Dat verklaart ook de groei van zijn omzet van 58 miljoen euro in 2003 tot 83 miljoen euro in 2004.
250. De onderneming IFB heeft dus haar economische levensvatbaarheid kunnen aantonen, zowel in haar herstructureringsplan, dat in 2003 is voorgelegd, als in de sindsdien geboekte resultaten.
3.2.2.3. Maatregelen om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken
251. Er moeten compenserende maatregelen worden genomen om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken. Anders zou de staatssteun als "in strijd met het gemeenschappelijk belang" en derhalve als onverenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt moeten worden beschouwd.
252. De Belgische autoriteiten leggen uit dat IFB twee maatregelen heeft genomen om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken:
- de stopzetting van zijn overslagactiviteiten in Frankrijk;
- de sluiting van de terminal van Bressoux in België en de verkoop van de participaties in de terminals in Brussel en Zeebrugge in België.
253. Als gevolg van deze twee maatregelen is de omzet van IFB gedaald van 62 miljoen euro in 2002 tot 58 miljoen euro in 2003. In 2004 echter lag de omzet van de onderneming met 83 miljoen euro reeds boven die van 2002.
254. De Commissie vestigt evenwel de aandacht van België op punt 40 van de richtsnoeren van 2004, waarin het volgende staat:
Afschrijvingen en sluiting van verliesgevende activiteiten die in ieder geval nodig zijn om de levensvatbaarheid te herstellen, worden bij de beoordeling van de compenserende maatregelen niet als inkrimping van capaciteit of aanwezigheid op de markt beschouwd.
255. Volgens de informatie die de Belgische regering aan de Commissie heeft verstrekt, lijken de terugtrekking uit de Franse markt en de sluiting van de terminals in België betrekking te hebben op verliesgevende activiteiten.
256. Teneinde uit te maken of deze twee maatregelen toereikend zijn om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken, dient te worden herinnerd aan de voornaamste ontwikkelingen van de twee markten waarop IFB actief is, namelijk de logistiekmarkt en de overslagmarkt. Vervolgens moet worden onderzocht of de voorgestelde maatregelen de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk beperken.
a) De logistiekmarkt en de steun voor IFB
257. Zoals in deel 2 van deze beschikking werd uitgelegd, is de logistiekmarkt een markt in volle verandering als gevolg van de openstelling van de markten van het spoorwegvervoer en het betreden van de markt door spoorweg- en postbedrijven, met tegelijkertijd een groot aantal kleine gespecialiseerde spelers en grote geïntegreerde spelers.
258. De Commissie stelt vast dat de voorgestelde maatregelen geen betrekking hebben op de logistiekmarkt. Zoals uit de tabel in punt 16 van deze beschikking blijkt, heeft IFB zijn volume op deze markt in 2004 aanzienlijk weten te verhogen (in vergelijking met 2003). België heeft geen enkele verbintenis voorgelegd waardoor de aanwezigheid van IFB op deze markt tijdens de herstructureringsperiode zou zijn beperkt.
259. De Commissie is bijgevolg van oordeel dat de afwezigheid van voorgestelde maatregelen voor de logistiekmarkt, alsmede de feiten dat de markt in volle verandering is en dat IFB zijn volume aanzienlijk heeft weten te verhogen, twijfels doen rijzen over de vraag of België de nadelige gevolgen voor de concurrentie zoveel mogelijk heeft beperkt wat de logistiekactiviteiten van IFB betreft.
b) De overslagmarkt en de steun voor IFB
260. De twee voorgestelde maatregelen hebben betrekking op de overslagmarkt. IFB heeft zijn activiteiten in Frankrijk zo goed als stopgezet, en heeft een terminal in België gesloten en zijn participaties in twee andere terminals verkocht.
261. De enige markt waarvoor de steun negatieve gevolgen voor de concurrentie kan hebben, is dus de Belgische markt. Op deze markt heeft IFB een marktaandeel van minder dan 7 % (zie de beschrijving van de markten in deel 2 van deze beschikking).
262. Om de negatieve gevolgen van de steun op de Belgische markt te beperken, heeft IFB een terminal gesloten en zijn participaties in twee andere terminals verkocht. De Commissie stelt echter enerzijds vast dat de sluiting de kleinste van deze terminals betrof en in de eerste plaats diende om de verliezen van IFB Terminals te verminderen, en anderzijds dat IFB opnieuw de twee terminals zal exploiteren die de onderneming na de kapitaalverhoging heeft verkocht, want de maatschappij TRW, waarvan de NMBS 47 % van de aandelen in IFB zal inbrengen, bezit aanzienlijke participaties in de terminals van Brussel en Zeebrugge.
263. Vervolgens stelt de Commissie vast dat IFB minderheidsparticipaties in een aantal belangrijke Belgische terminals bezit.
264. Bijgevolg heeft de Commissie twijfels over de vraag of de door IFB voorgestelde maatregelen om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrentie op de overslagmarkt zoveel mogelijk te beperken, toereikend zijn.
3.2.2.4. Beperking van de steun tot het strikte minimum en bijdrage van de begunstigde onderneming
265. Teneinde aan te tonen dat de steun tot het strikte minimum beperkt blijft, legt de Belgische regering uit dat de kapitaalverhoging ertoe beperkt blijft het maatschappelijk kapitaal van IFB, dat als gevolg van de in 2001 en 2002 geboekte verliezen negatief was geworden, in zoverre te herstellen dat de onderneming haar economische levensvatbaarheid kan terugvinden. Zoals hierboven in deel 2 is uitgelegd, zal de solvabiliteitsratio, d.w.z. de verhouding eigen vermogen/passiva, van IFB na de kapitaalverhoging 33 % bedragen.
266. België heeft de Commissie de solvabiliteitsratio's van de voornaamste concurrenten van IFB meegedeeld. Deze zijn als volgt:
Terminalexploitanten | |
ABP Ports | 59,60 |
Hesse-Noord Natie | 58,19 |
Katoennatie Terminals | 54,97 |
Schelde Container Terminal Noord | 53,33 |
Sea-Ro-Terminal | 43,75 |
RSC | 74,24 |
Gemiddelde | 57,35 |
| |
Transportondernemingen | |
DHL Freight (weg) | 34,60 |
ECS European Containers (weg) | 14,27 |
Gefco Benelux (spoor) | 39,92 |
Henri Essers (weg) | 15,71 |
Rhinecontainer (binnenvaart) | 18,63 |
TRW (spoor) | 20,74 |
Ziegler (weg) | 20,42 |
Gemiddelde | 23,47 |
| |
Ondernemingen met gemengde activiteiten | |
Gosselin | 38,92 |
Hupac | 34,90 |
Gemiddelde | 36,91 |
| |
Algemeen gemiddelde | 39,24 |
267. De Commissie neemt er nota van dat de voor IFB beoogde solvabiliteitsratio lager is dan die van de terminalexploitanten en ook, ofschoon in mindere mate, lager dan die van de ondernemingen met gemengde activiteiten. Het cijfer is echter wel hoger dan het gemiddelde van de solvabiliteitsratio's voor de transportondernemingen. Voorts ligt de kapitaalverhoging ook 20 miljoen euro onder het bedrag dat de consultant McKinsey in het herstructureringsplan had aanbevolen. De Commissie beschikt evenwel in dit stadium niet over voldoende elementen om definitief te concluderen dat de steun tot het strikte minimum is beperkt.
268. De Commissie vestigt de aandacht van de Belgische regering op de bepalingen van punt 42 en volgende van de richtsnoeren van 2004, die luiden als volgt:
Van de steun ontvangende ondernemingen wordt verwacht dat zij uit eigen middelen, zo nodig door de verkoop van activa die voor het voortbestaan van de onderneming niet onontbeerlijk zijn of door externe financiering tegen marktvoorwaarden, een belangrijke bijdrage aan het herstructureringsplan leveren. Deze bijdrage is een teken dat de markten er vertrouwen in hebben dat een herstel van de levensvatbaarheid haalbaar is. Zij moet reëel — dus actueel — zijn, onder uitsluiting van alle voor de toekomst verwachte winst en kasstromen, en zij moet zo hoog mogelijk zijn.
In de regel beschouwt de Commissie de volgende bijdragen aan de herstructurering als passend: minstens 25 % in het geval van kleine ondernemingen, minstens 40 % in het geval van middelgrote en minstens 50 % in het geval van grote ondernemingen. In uitzonderlijke omstandigheden en in geval van een door de lidstaat aan te tonen bijzondere noodsituatie kan de Commissie een lagere bijdrage accepteren.
Om de mededingingsverstorende effecten te beperken, moet de omvang van de steun of de vorm waarin hij wordt verleend zodanig zijn dat de onderneming niet de beschikking krijgt over extra kasmiddelen die kunnen worden gebruikt voor agressieve, marktverstorende activiteiten welke met het herstructureringsproces geen verband houden. Daartoe onderzoekt de Commissie de omvang van de passiva van de onderneming na de herstructurering, evenals de situatie na uitstel van betaling of vermindering van haar schulden, met name in het kader van de voortzetting van haar activiteiten na een collectieve insolventieprocedure volgens het nationale recht. De steun mag noch geheel noch gedeeltelijk worden gebruikt voor de financiering van nieuwe investeringen die voor het herstel van de levensvatbaarheid van de onderneming niet onmisbaar zijn.
269. De Commissie stelt vast dat IFB volgens het herstructureringsplan geen eigen bijdrage tot zijn herstructurering lijkt te leveren. De Commissie heeft dan ook twijfels over de vraag of IFB, zoals in de richtsnoeren van 2004 wordt geëist, op voldoende wijze aan zijn herstructureringssteun bijdraagt.
3.2.2.5. Jaarverslag en "one time, last time"
270. De Belgische regering heeft ermee ingestemd een jaarverslag bij de Commissie in te dienen zodat de Commissie kan beoordelen of het herstructureringsplan ten uitvoer wordt gelegd overeenkomstig de door de Belgische autoriteiten aangegane verbintenissen.
271. Ten slotte dient te worden nagegaan of in verband met de herstructureringssteun het beginsel "one time, last time" is nageleefd. Volgens de door de Belgische autoriteiten verstrekte informatie heeft IFB voordien geen herstructureringssteun ontvangen. De Commissie heeft voordien geen besluit betreffende IFB genomen. Zij is dus van oordeel dat aan het criterium "one time, last time" is voldaan.
3.3. CONCLUSIE
272. De Commissie is in dit stadium van oordeel dat de toekenning van een uitstel van betaling voor de bestaande schulden van 63 miljoen euro en de omzetting daarvan en van de bijbehorende rente van 11 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal staatssteun vormen, omdat de NMBS niet heeft gehandeld zoals een particuliere investeerder in een markteconomie zou hebben gedaan.
273. Vormen evenzo staatssteun de toekenning van een terugvorderbaar voorschot van 5 miljoen euro en de toekenning van een kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro, de omzetting van de kredietfaciliteit van 15 miljoen euro en van de bijbehorende rente van 2,5 miljoen euro in maatschappelijk kapitaal, alsmede de inbreng in natura van 5 miljoen euro nieuw maatschappelijk kapitaal.
274. In zoverre deze steun kassteun vormt, kan hij als herstructureringssteun niet verenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt worden verklaard, omdat hij voor een periode van langer dan 12 maanden is toegekend.
275. De Commissie heeft twijfels over de vraag of de steun in zijn geheel als herstructureringssteun verenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt kan worden verklaard.
276. Haar twijfels hebben betrekking op de toerekenbaarheid van een deel van de steun aan de Belgische staat, de toereikendheid van de maatregelen die zijn genomen om de nadelige gevolgen van de steun voor de concurrenten zoveel mogelijk te beperken, alsmede op de beperking van de steun tot het strikte minimum en op de toereikendheid van de eigen bijdrage van de onderneming IFB aan de herstructureringssteun.
4. BESCHIKKING
De Commissie heeft besloten de reddingsmaatregelen en de herstructureringsmaatregelen ten gunste van IFB in dit stadium te beschouwen als staatssteun als bedoeld in artikel 87, lid 1, van het EG-Verdrag.
Zij uit twijfels over de vraag of deze steun op grond van de richtsnoeren voor herstructureringssteun verenigbaar met de gemeenschappelijke markt kan worden verklaard, en leidt bijgevolg voor dit deel van de zaak de bij artikel 88, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag vastgestelde procedure in.
Gelet op de bovenstaande overwegingen verzoekt de Commissie België in het kader van de procedure van artikel 88, lid 2, van het EG-Verdrag binnen een maand vanaf de datum van ontvangst van dit schrijven zijn opmerkingen te maken en alle dienstige inlichtingen te verstrekken voor de beoordeling van de steunmaatregel. Zij verzoekt uw autoriteiten onverwijld een afschrift van deze brief aan de potentiële begunstigde van de steunmaatregel te doen toekomen.
De Commissie wijst België op de schorsende werking van artikel 88, lid 3, van het EG-Verdrag. Zij verwijst naar artikel 14 van Verordening (EG) nr. 659/1999, volgens hetwelk elke onrechtmatige steun van de begunstigde kan worden teruggevorderd.
Voorts deelt de Commissie België mee, dat zij de belanghebbenden door de bekendmaking van dit schrijven en van een samenvatting ervan in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie in kennis zal stellen. Tevens zal zij de belanghebbenden in de lidstaten van de EVA die partij zijn bij de EER-Overeenkomst door de bekendmaking van een mededeling in het EER-Supplement van het Publicatieblad in kennis stellen, alsmede de Toezichthoudende Autoriteit van de EVA door haar een afschrift van dit schrijven toe te zenden. Alle bovengenoemde belanghebbenden zal worden verzocht hun opmerkingen te maken binnen een maand vanaf de datum van deze bekendmaking."

Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003
(2006/C 210/02)
(Text with EEA relevance)
INTRODUCTION
1. Pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003 [1], the Commission may, by decision, impose fines on undertakings or associations of undertakings where, either intentionally or negligently, they infringe Article 81 or 82 of the Treaty.
2. In exercising its power to impose such fines, the Commission enjoys a wide margin of discretion [2] within the limits set by Regulation No 1/2003. First, the Commission must have regard both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement. Second, the fine imposed may not exceed the limits specified in Article 23(2), second and third subparagraphs, of Regulation No 1/2003.
3. In order to ensure the transparency and impartiality of its decisions, the Commission published on 14 January 1998 guidelines on the method of setting fines [3]. After more than eight years of implementation, the Commission has acquired sufficient experience to develop further and refine its policy on fines.
4. The Commission's power to impose fines on undertakings or associations of undertakings which, intentionally or negligently, infringe Article 81 or 82 of the Treaty is one of the means conferred on it in order for it to carry out the task of supervision entrusted to it by the Treaty. That task not only includes the duty to investigate and sanction individual infringements, but it also encompasses the duty to pursue a general policy designed to apply, in competition matters, the principles laid down by the Treaty and to steer the conduct of undertakings in the light of those principles [4]. For this purpose, the Commission must ensure that its action has the necessary deterrent effect [5]. Accordingly, when the Commission discovers that Article 81 or 82 of the Treaty has been infringed, it may be necessary to impose a fine on those who have acted in breach of the law. Fines should have a sufficiently deterrent effect, not only in order to sanction the undertakings concerned (specific deterrence) but also in order to deter other undertakings from engaging in, or continuing, behaviour that is contrary to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty (general deterrence).
5. In order to achieve these objectives, it is appropriate for the Commission to refer to the value of the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates as a basis for setting the fine. The duration of the infringement should also play a significant role in the setting of the appropriate amount of the fine. It necessarily has an impact on the potential consequences of the infringement on the market. It is therefore considered important that the fine should also reflect the number of years during which an undertaking participated in the infringement.
6. The combination of the value of sales to which the infringement relates and of the duration of the infringement is regarded as providing an appropriate proxy to reflect the economic importance of the infringement as well as the relative weight of each undertaking in the infringement. Reference to these factors provides a good indication of the order of magnitude of the fine and should not be regarded as the basis for an automatic and arithmetical calculation method.
7. It is also considered appropriate to include in the fine a specific amount irrespective of the duration of the infringement, in order to deter companies from even entering into illegal practices.
8. The sections below set out the principles which will guide the Commission when it sets fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003.
METHOD FOR THE SETTING OF FINES
9. Without prejudice to point 37 below, the Commission will use the following two-step methodology when setting the fine to be imposed on undertakings or associations of undertakings.
10. First, the Commission will determine a basic amount for each undertaking or association of undertakings (see Section 1 below).
11. Second, it may adjust that basic amount upwards or downwards (see Section 2 below).
1. Basic amount of the fine
12. The basic amount will be set by reference to the value of sales and applying the following methodology.
A. Calculation of the value of sales
13. In determining the basic amount of the fine to be imposed, the Commission will take the value of the undertaking's sales of goods or services to which the infringement directly or indirectly [6] relates in the relevant geographic area within the EEA. It will normally take the sales made by the undertaking during the last full business year of its participation in the infringement (hereafter "value of sales").
14. Where the infringement by an association of undertakings relates to the activities of its members, the value of sales will generally correspond to the sum of the value of sales by its members.
15. In determining the value of sales by an undertaking, the Commission will take that undertaking's best available figures.
16. Where the figures made available by an undertaking are incomplete or not reliable, the Commission may determine the value of its sales on the basis of the partial figures it has obtained and/or any other information which it regards as relevant and appropriate.
17. The value of sales will be determined before VAT and other taxes directly related to the sales.
18. Where the geographic scope of an infringement extends beyond the EEA (e.g. worldwide cartels), the relevant sales of the undertakings within the EEA may not properly reflect the weight of each undertaking in the infringement. This may be the case in particular with worldwide market-sharing arrangements.
In such circumstances, in order to reflect both the aggregate size of the relevant sales within the EEA and the relative weight of each undertaking in the infringement, the Commission may assess the total value of the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates in the relevant geographic area (wider than the EEA), may determine the share of the sales of each undertaking party to the infringement on that market and may apply this share to the aggregate sales within the EEA of the undertakings concerned. The result will be taken as the value of sales for the purpose of setting the basic amount of the fine.
B. Determination of the basic amount of the fine
19. The basic amount of the fine will be related to a proportion of the value of sales, depending on the degree of gravity of the infringement, multiplied by the number of years of infringement.
20. The assessment of gravity will be made on a case-by-case basis for all types of infringement, taking account of all the relevant circumstances of the case.
21. As a general rule, the proportion of the value of sales taken into account will be set at a level of up to 30 % of the value of sales.
22. In order to decide whether the proportion of the value of sales to be considered in a given case should be at the lower end or at the higher end of that scale, the Commission will have regard to a number of factors, such as the nature of the infringement, the combined market share of all the undertakings concerned, the geographic scope of the infringement and whether or not the infringement has been implemented.
23. Horizontal price-fixing, market-sharing and output-limitation agreements [7], which are usually secret, are, by their very nature, among the most harmful restrictions of competition. As a matter of policy, they will be heavily fined. Therefore, the proportion of the value of sales taken into account for such infringements will generally be set at the higher end of the scale.
24. In order to take fully into account the duration of the participation of each undertaking in the infringement, the amount determined on the basis of the value of sales (see points 20 to 23 above) will be multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement. Periods of less than six months will be counted as half a year; periods longer than six months but shorter than one year will be counted as a full year.
25. In addition, irrespective of the duration of the undertaking's participation in the infringement, the Commission will include in the basic amount a sum of between 15 % and 25 % of the value of sales as defined in Section A above in order to deter undertakings from even entering into horizontal price-fixing, market-sharing and output-limitation agreements. The Commission may also apply such an additional amount in the case of other infringements. For the purpose of deciding the proportion of the value of sales to be considered in a given case, the Commission will have regard to a number of factors, in particular those referred in point 22.
26. Where the value of sales by undertakings participating in the infringement is similar but not identical, the Commission may set for each of them an identical basic amount. Moreover, in determining the basic amount of the fine, the Commission will use rounded figures.
2. Adjustments to the basic amount
27. In setting the fine, the Commission may take into account circumstances that result in an increase or decrease in the basic amount as determined in Section 1 above. It will do so on the basis of an overall assessment which takes account of all the relevant circumstances.
A. Aggravating circumstances
28. The basic amount may be increased where the Commission finds that there are aggravating circumstances, such as:
- where an undertaking continues or repeats the same or a similar infringement after the Commission or a national competition authority has made a finding that the undertaking infringed Article 81 or 82: the basic amount will be increased by up to 100 % for each such infringement established;
- refusal to cooperate with or obstruction of the Commission in carrying out its investigations;
- role of leader in, or instigator of, the infringement; the Commission will also pay particular attention to any steps taken to coerce other undertakings to participate in the infringement and/or any retaliatory measures taken against other undertakings with a view to enforcing the practices constituting the infringement.
B. Mitigating circumstances
29. The basic amount may be reduced where the Commission finds that mitigating circumstances exist, such as:
- where the undertaking concerned provides evidence that it terminated the infringement as soon as the Commission intervened: this will not apply to secret agreements or practices (in particular, cartels);
- where the undertaking provides evidence that the infringement has been committed as a result of negligence;
- where the undertaking provides evidence that its involvement in the infringement is substantially limited and thus demonstrates that, during the period in which it was party to the offending agreement, it actually avoided applying it by adopting competitive conduct in the market: the mere fact that an undertaking participated in an infringement for a shorter duration than others will not be regarded as a mitigating circumstance since this will already be reflected in the basic amount;
- where the undertaking concerned has effectively cooperated with the Commission outside the scope of the Leniency Notice and beyond its legal obligation to do so;
- where the anti-competitive conduct of the undertaking has been authorized or encouraged by public authorities or by legislation. [8]
C. Specific increase for deterrence
30. The Commission will pay particular attention to the need to ensure that fines have a sufficiently deterrent effect; to that end, it may increase the fine to be imposed on undertakings which have a particularly large turnover beyond the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates.
31. The Commission will also take into account the need to increase the fine in order to exceed the amount of gains improperly made as a result of the infringement where it is possible to estimate that amount.
D. Legal maximum
32. The final amount of the fine shall not, in any event, exceed 10 % of the total turnover in the preceding business year of the undertaking or association of undertakings participating in the infringement, as laid down in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003.
33. Where an infringement by an association of undertakings relates to the activities of its members, the fine shall not exceed 10 % of the sum of the total turnover of each member active on the market affected by that infringement.
E. Leniency Notice
34. The Commission will apply the leniency rules in line with the conditions set out in the applicable notice.
F. Ability to pay
35. In exceptional cases, the Commission may, upon request, take account of the undertaking's inability to pay in a specific social and economic context. It will not base any reduction granted for this reason in the fine on the mere finding of an adverse or loss-making financial situation. A reduction could be granted solely on the basis of objective evidence that imposition of the fine as provided for in these Guidelines would irretrievably jeopardise the economic viability of the undertaking concerned and cause its assets to lose all their value.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
36. The Commission may, in certain cases, impose a symbolic fine. The justification for imposing such a fine should be given in its decision. 37. Although these Guidelines present the general methodology for the setting of fines, the particularities of a given case or the need to achieve deterrence in a particular case may justify departing from such methodology or from the limits specified in point 21.
38. These Guidelines will be applied in all cases where a statement of objections is notified after their date of publication in the Official Journal, regardless of whether the fine is imposed pursuant to Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 or Article 15(2) of Regulation 17/62 [9].

Note 1 Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal ("dow"), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise.
Note 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive.
Note:
- Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to the Directive 98/34/EC [2] of the European Parliament and Council amended by the Directive 98/48/EC [3].
- Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.
- This list replaces all the previous lists published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Commission ensures the updating of this list.

Objective of aid | Aid to SMEs | Yes This R%amp%D project is developing knowledge and technology in the field of the practical application of biological test media. The manufacture of medicines and food is subject to increasingly high quality and hygiene requirements (including HAACP). Intrusive measuring for this purpose involves contact with the product. The equipment used has to be cleaned after testing. Achieving the requisite sterility demands investment in increasingly expensive appliances. This project seeks a possible alternative through R%amp%D in the field of disposable containers with built-in data-acquisition and -transmission capacities. During manufacturing the process parameters need to be measured online and transmitted to a central process-operating system. The physical components to be developed need to be small and cheap, hence the project. Delft university is responsible for providing the scientific know-how and for developing the strips to which the sensors are attached. |

Reference has been made to the Court of Justice of the European Communities by order of the Ufficio del Giudice di Pace di Monselice (Italy) of 12 July 2005, received at the Court Registry on 12 August 2005, for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings between LIDL Italia Srl and Comune di Arcole (VR) on the following questions:
1. Must Directive 2000/13/EC [1] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs be interpreted as meaning, in respect of pre-packaged foodstuffs under Article 1 thereof, that the obligations provided for therein, and in particular those in Articles 2, 3 and 12, are imposed only on the producer of the pre-packaged food product?
2. If the answer to the first question is affirmative, must Articles 2, 3 and 12 of Directive 2000/13/EC be interpreted as precluding the possibility that a mere distributor, located within a Member State, of a foodstuff pre-packaged (as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2000/13/EC) by a trader in another Member State, may be held liable for an infringement alleged by a public authority involving a discrepancy between the value (in this case percentage of alcohol content) stated on the label by the producer of the pre-packaged foodstuff, and may thus be penalised, even if that distributor simply markets the foodstuff in the form in which it is delivered by the producer of the food product itself?

Removal from the register of Case C-58/05 [1]
(2006/C 60/67)
Language of the case: Swedish
By order of 22 November 2005, the President of the Court of Justice of the European Communities has ordered the removal from the register of Case C-58/05: Commission of the European Communities
Action brought on 13 February 2006 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Hellenic Republic
An action against the Hellenic Republic was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 February 2006 by the Commission of the European Communities, represented by Amparo Alcover San Pedro and Minas Konstantinidis, of its Legal Service, acting as Agents, with an address for service in Luxembourg.
The Commission claims that the Court should:
1. declare that, by failing to adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Commission Directive 2003/73/EC [1] of 24 July 2003 amending Annex III to Directive 1999/94/EC, and in any event by failing to inform the Commission thereof, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive;
2. order the Hellenic Republic to pay the costs.
Pleas in law and main arguments
The period prescribed for transposing the directive into national law expired on 25 July 2004.

Action brought on 14 February 2006 — Commission v Elliniki Etairia Epikhirimatikis Protovoulias — Hellenic Ventures S.A. — and five other defendants
Parties
Applicant: Commission of the European Communities (represented by: M. Patakia and by S. Khatzigiannis, lawyer)
Defendant: Elliniki Etairia Epikhirimatikis Protovoulias — Hellenic Ventures S.A., Konstantinos Katsigiannis, Panagiotis Chronopoulos, Minas Patsouris, Nikolaos Poulakos and Robert Ceurvorst Form of order sought
The applicant claims that the Court should:
- order the defendant company, jointly with the second to the sixth defendants, to repay to the Commission the entire amount of the advance received by the first defendant from the Community, that is, ECU (now EURO) 70000, together with interest, calculated as laid down in the contract, amounting, until 12 February 2006, to a sum of ECU (now EURO) 103423,54, that is, a total of ECU (now EURO) 171939,18, as well as interest, again in accordance with the terms of the contract, of 1.5 % per month, that is, an amount of ECU (now EURO) 34.52 per day for the period from 1 January 2006 until full discharge of the sum due by the defendants;
- order the defendants jointly to pay the Commission's costs, including the fees of the Commission's lawyers.
Pleas in law and main arguments
The European Community, represented by the European Commission, concluded with the first defendant company, in which the other defendants are shareholders and members of its Board or directors, a contract entitled %quot%Seed Fund 601%quot%, in the context of the Pilot action to create and develop seed-capital funds. [1]
Under that contract the Commission undertook to provide to the first defendant financial support in the form of a repayable advance of a maximum amount of ECU 350000. That advance was intended to cover a maximum limit of 50 % of the operating costs which the first defendant would incur in the context of its activities as the Fund for start-up business capital in Greece. In that context, the Commission paid to the first defendant the first annual advance of ECU 70000.
By letter of 16 June 1994, the Commission informed the defendant that it was rescinding the contract and asked it to repay, with interest, the amount of ECU 70000. By letter of 19 September 1994 the Commission explained that that decision was taken as a result of the defendant's refusal to submit to a detailed inspection by the auditors of the Commission's financial control service, in breach of Article 8(1) of the contract. The Commission had decided that such an audit was indispensable in view of the findings of a Commission official who had carried out an on-the-spot inspection and had expressed serious doubts as to whether the investments which the first defendant company was supposed to have funded corresponded to the tender specifications.
Although the first defendant was repeatedly called upon to repay the amount demanded, it failed to do so.
By its action the Commission seeks payment of the above amount owed to it together with the interest due.

Action brought on 6 February 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Ireland
Parties
Applicant: Commission of the European Communities (represented by: F. Simonetti and X. Lewis, Agents, F. Louis, avocat and C. O'Daly, Solicitor)
Defendant: Ireland
The applicant claims that the Court should:
- declare that, by not adopting, in conformity with Articles 2(1) and 4(2), (3) and (4) of the EIA Directive, all measures to ensure that, before consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment that belong to the categories of projects covered by Annex II Class 1(a), (b), (c) and (f) are made subject to a requirement for development consent and to an assessment with regard to their effects in accordance with Articles 5 to 10 of the EIA Directive, Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the said Directive; and
- order Ireland to pay the costs.
Pleas in law and main arguments
The use of uniform, unqualified size thresholds
The Commission considers the Irish transposing legislation is deficient as it does not provide, in respect of project categories covered by Annex II Class 1(a), (b) and (c) of the Environmental Impact Assessment (the EIA Directive), for effective measures to achieve the results required by Articles 2(1), 4(2) and 4(3) of the EIA Directive.
Article 4(2) permits Member States to determine, by either a case-by-case examination or by %quot%thresholds or criteria set by the Member State%quot%, the necessity of an EIA for projects listed in Annex II. Whatever the means of determination implemented by the Member State, this means must satisfy Article 4(3), i.e., take into account the selection criteria listed in Annex III. These selection criteria include, for example, the project size, cumulation with other projects, its location, the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area and its impact on landscapes of historical, cultural or archaeological significance.
In its transposing legislation regarding projects falling under Annex II Class 1(a), (b) and (c), Ireland has, however, relied on a uniform, unqualified size threshold without any possibility of assessing any other project characteristics.
Intensive fish farming
With regard to trial fish farms, the transposing legislation would appear to allow for the possibility of an EIA %quot%if the Minister considers that the proposed aquaculture is likely to have significant effects on the environment.%quot% This legislation, however, does not contain any reference to the selection criteria set out in Annex III of the EIA Directive. Thus, the Minister is under no express obligation to take account of the proposed location of such a trial fish farm or of any of the other selection criteria, for the purposes of determining if an EIA is necessary.
The Commission notes that Ireland acknowledges the need to make express provision for the Annex III selection criteria with regard to fish farm projects. However, as far as the Commission is aware, no amending legislation has been enacted or communicated to the Commission.

Referring court
Hoge Raad der Nederlanden
Parties to the main proceedings
Applicant: Staatssecretaris van Financiën
Defendant: Orange European Smallcap Fund NV
Question(s) referred
1. Must Article 56 EC, in conjunction with Article 58(1) EC, be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition in Article 56 EC is incompatible with a rule in a Member State under which — for the reasons set out in at the end of section 5.2.1 of this judgment — a concession to be granted to a fiscal investment enterprise on account of taxation at source deducted in another Member State from dividends received by the fiscal investment enterprise is restricted:
(a) to the amount which a natural person resident in the Netherlands could have had credited on the basis of a tax treaty concluded with the other Member State;
(b) where and to the extent to which the shareholders of the fiscal investment enterprise are not natural persons resident in the Netherlands or bodies subject to Netherlands corporation tax?
2. If the answer to Question 1 is wholly or partly in the affirmative:
(a) Does %quot%direct investment%quot% in Article 57(1) EC also include the holding of a block of shares in a company if the holder of the shares holds them only as an investment and the size of the block does not put the holder in a position to exercise a decisive influence over the management or control of the company?
(b) Under Article 56 EC, is any restriction of the movement of capital connected with the levying of tax that would be impermissible if it related to cross-border movement of capital within the EC similarly impermissible in the case of the same movement of capital — in otherwise similar circumstances — to and from third countries?
(c) If the answer to Question 2(b) is in the negative, must Article 56 EC then be interpreted as meaning that a restriction by a Member State of a tax concession granted to a fiscal investment enterprise with regard to taxation at source of a dividend received from a third country, that restriction being based on the fact that not all shareholders of the fiscal investment enterprise have their place of residence in the Member State concerned, is incompatible with that article?
3. Is the answer to the above questions affected by whether:
(a) the tax deducted in another country from the dividend received from that country is higher than the tax on the payment of that dividend to foreign shareholders in the Member State of establishment of the fiscal investment enterprise;
(b) the shareholders of the fiscal investment enterprise who have their place of residence outside the Member State of establishment of the fiscal investment enterprise are resident or established in a country with which the above-mentioned Member State has a treaty providing for reciprocal credit of taxation of dividends at source;
(c) the shareholders of the fiscal investment enterprise who have their place of residence outside the Member State of establishment of the fiscal investment enterprise are resident or established in another country of the EC?

On 22 November 2006, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 [1] by which the undertaking CIE Management II Limited (%quot%CIEM%quot%, Guenersey), general partner and manager of BC European Capital VIII (%quot%BC%quot%, Guenersey), acquires control within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation of the whole of Techem AG (%quot%TECHEM%quot%, Germany), a German public listed company, by means of a public takeover bid addressed to Techem's shareholders, announced on 22 November 2006.
2. The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
- for CIEM: general partner and manager acting for BC;
- for BC: private equity fund;
- for TECHEM: sub-metering of utilities consumption and the market for energy contracting.
3. On preliminary examination, the Commission finds that the notified transaction could fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004. However, the final decision on this point is reserved. Pursuant to the Commission Notice on a simplified procedure for treatment of certain concentrations under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 [2] it should be noted that this case is a candidate for treatment under the procedure set out in the Notice.

Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) of 3 October 2006 (reference for a preliminary ruling from the Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main — Germany) — Fidium Finanz AG v Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht
(Case C-452/04) [1]
Referring court

Parties to the main proceedings
Applicant: Fidium Finanz AG
Defendant: Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht
Re:
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main — Interpretation of Arts 49, 56 and 58 EC — Undertaking established in a non-member country whose activities, consisting in the granting of loans, are directed entirely or principally at the territory of a Member State — Requirement of prior authorisation in the Member State in which the service is provided
Operative part of the judgment
National rules whereby a Member State makes the granting of credit on a commercial basis, on national territory, by a company established in a non-member country subject to prior authorisation, and which provide that such authorisation must be refused, in particular, if that company does not have its central administration or a branch in that territory, affect primarily the exercise of the freedom to provide services within the meaning of Article 49 EC et seq. A company established in a non-member country cannot rely on those provisions.

Defendant: G-Star International B.V.
Questions referred
(1) Must Article 3(1)(e), first indent [1], be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition contained therein permanently precludes the registration of a shape as a trade mark where the nature of the product is such that its appearance and shaping determine its market value entirely or substantially as a result of their beauty or original character, or does the prohibition not apply where, prior to the application for registration, the attractiveness of the relevant shape to the public has been determined predominantly by the recognition of it as a distinctive sign?
(2) If the answer to Question 1 is to the latter effect, to what extent must this attractiveness have prevailed for the prohibition no longer to apply?
[1] First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks (OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 1).
